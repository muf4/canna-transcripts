[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode 308 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the post 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys had a great 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining me at the table across the table
from me is our good friend or repeat
[SPEAKER_01]: offender, White Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Mike, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it good for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel a little dried out still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a little dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been yelling and
screaming, but it's just from the dabs and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the flowers that I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling a little half human,
half jerky right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half jerky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've always been a little jerky,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been since the Dude Grows Cup last
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't stopped since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, we have cool employment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at 420, on 420, we were able to take
some 420 smokeage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just rearranged our break schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the beginning of a smoke filled
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: On sometime last week, Wednesday,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I went last Wednesday and I bought
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought concentrates for the rest of the
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I bought a stash for 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I burned right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, my throat is shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I burnt right through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go shopping again today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got back from the dispensary just
a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you guys know what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a challenge because I
just got back from the dispensary and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we've taken a dab of all almost
everything we bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some Mendo Breath Ambrosia,
which tastes phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set me back in my seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't tried that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sour Pez Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super sweet pezzy candy, kind of a
grapefruit with a cherry aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Clementine tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't get me high, but the Clementine
and Clementine are two different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Clementine has that Clementine
deliciousness, but it's also got another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing in there that does get me high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the one that fucked me up,
the one that made me want to just go lay
[SPEAKER_01]: down on the couch or maybe even on the
floor might have been okay, was the Louie
[SPEAKER_01]: the 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: This battery will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I took that dab and I was talking
and in the middle of my sentence,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, did I melt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I done?
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like that girl on the couch in the
fucking old commercial that just melted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it did to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I don't have bones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I finally found that weed that did
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit got me lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the King Louie the 13 batter from
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the flavor of the Mendo Breath
better, but the high on the Louie was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, ladies and gentlemen, if you listen
to the podcast often, you've heard me talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the Starchild OG that I got from a
cut above.
It's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and got some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it is so delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but the jar that I bought today
is almost gone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I have been overindulging on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with the citrus dryer
sheet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandalwood peppermint flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hint of peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that candle store kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of sense and flavors all at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dryer sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the candy we're out front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dryer sheet thing that it leaves
on your mouth, that cotton mouth flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dryer sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's turpeniline is what I think that
turpenoid is that gives you that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find that in Jack Herrer a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find that in the train wreck,
I guess, because that's what this cross
[SPEAKER_01]: has train wreck in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably where that came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't tried it yet, but I've also got
some of the Green Dot Labs black label
[SPEAKER_01]: white Durbin nectar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the white cross to Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to try this one in a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just tried so many things that I had
to save one for later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Green Dot is kind of the fancy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to do a slightly more coherent
show, so we slowed our roll a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Green Dot is a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth the money, but I prefer a
different consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything was on sale for $4.20,
so I grabbed some of the Green Dot black
[SPEAKER_01]: label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be like my secret
stash, my spoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: My self stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The after podcast dabs when you want to
get a little goofy and not have to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're smoking on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike really seemed to like the Sour Pez
when I gave him a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then which one was it that really made
you choke up a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Mendo Breath was definitely...
Yeah, the Mendo Breath was a coffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one made you choke up a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think everybody enjoyed all the
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great work to Cut Above and Green Dot
and Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of home runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a great $4.20.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a hazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Daisy, $4.20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, did you do anything exciting on
$4.20?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just a lot of consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skipped most of the events.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier that way.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is real crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been stocking up for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got home and I was like, well,
I have all my favorite flower and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of live residents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of things to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find a segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to you by our
friends at the Hela Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need some new genetics for your
garden, I recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hela Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab some new iREGENETIC seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, shout out to my friends at PL Grow
Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them at plgrow.systems is
what I think that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have gotten that completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out their product called The Minder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love, much respect to PL Grow
Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm able to go to events like
the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to go to Civic Center Park where
I can take dads with my friends in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wind and rain and try to enjoy 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to go to reggae shows and I can
check on the garden with my phone by using
[SPEAKER_01]: The Minder unit from PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you what the temp and humidity
is in my room at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to walk to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be in my underwear on the couch
watching Bob's Burgers and we can check on
[SPEAKER_01]: the grill room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love and respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list of things I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my weed card renewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: About time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too early, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too early is way easier to fix than too
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too late causes a bunch of headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't let me pay for it because I'm
not 30 days within the expiration date
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to wait a couple of days here
before I could pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on free time right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hardest part about getting my weed
card renewed was getting the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to call several times and they kept
saying, we're booked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, we're booked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, can you just give me a
date further out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened was the main weed doctor for
my area has retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that Mike and I go to,
can I say his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that fair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Bruce Reimers has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's retired from the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not writing marijuana cards anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been doing it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: For at least five or six years that I've
gone to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at least been five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably closer to eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's made plenty of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a new doctor there and I had
to kind of reintroduce myself and meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: new doctor, but the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hardest part was getting the
appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they said, we've got this day at this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what are my other options?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, you're coming fucking
Wednesday at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see you there or no doctor for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go there and I didn't get stuck in
the elevator this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time I went to that building,
I got stuck in the elevator and they
[SPEAKER_01]: almost canceled my appointment because I
was 20 minutes late.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey, I'm stuck in your
elevator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, don't miss your
appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, will you help me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stuck in the fucking elevator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, we don't know what to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't miss your appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of threw a fit when I got in
the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey, I was stuck in the
elevator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should feel bad for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't just fuck my appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't just jerking off in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they let me have my appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this time they said, it's going to be
a minute because the state is updating
[SPEAKER_01]: their computer system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're no longer going to have these cards
that we print.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a minute and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to have the card
attached to the barcode on your ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're no longer going to have to
present a card.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just walk in with your Colorado ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will swipe that just like they do at
the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll show that you're old enough that
you're a patient and it'll let you in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the day that I went was the first day
they were activating this new system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which meant the computer was all fucked up
and everything was taken for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my visit, I sat in line for at least an
hour, maybe two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just playing with my phone, chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have you fill out the little
application and stuff online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hit refresh because mine had
already been all filled out before.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my information is still the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Refilled everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the doctor came and explained what
happened to Bruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, he's been in the weed
industry since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like a big part of legalization
where he's from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, but he retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the new doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you seen Dr. Reimer's?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, this is probably my seventh or
eighth time with medical alternatives
[SPEAKER_01]: renewing my card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just signed for my paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your new renewal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty much all it took.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, this is going to take 24
hours to update because the website is
[SPEAKER_01]: down, but check this in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure all your information is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'll be legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, fucking went about my day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went shopping and dispensaries in
Colorado Springs since I was up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, uh, high five, everybody leave and
go shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 24 hours later, I go to check
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my new stuff was updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed me to print off a new card,
but it won't let me pay for anything yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to wait, I think six more days
until my old card is 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's going to be within 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even 30 days from expired yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to jump on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, renewing has always like the
doctor's appointment's always been the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes, yeah, the doctor's
appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then back in the day, you would get
your card renewal and then have to mail it
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'd have to review it and send
it back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could take six to eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there was a problem with it,
now you're looking at another three to
[SPEAKER_01]: five more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was taking you 13 weeks,
14, 16 weeks just to get your card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you couldn't shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't be able to go to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go through a little bit of
concentrate to where if I couldn't shop at
[SPEAKER_01]: a medical dispensary, it would probably
put me in a pinch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to stay on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to stay on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I got ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, especially being in the industry,
those are something that I always stay on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of is my, my weed card and my badge,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to stay on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got the weed card.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they do not do extended plant counts
like they used to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, you could say,
I need an extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would say, what hurts?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does 250 bucks worth of pain look
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does fucking 24 plants cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would say, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's fucking money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write this down on your
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it used to be Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're not going to play games
because it's not like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to remember a doctor's name
the other day and I couldn't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just popped in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know his fucking name right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, um, there were a lot of doctors
walking in and they had a, it was like the
[SPEAKER_00]: drink menu at Chili's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just had a little placard at the end
of the on the doctor's desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like regular six count 99,
like 12 count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember one, one 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went up to 500 count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, that is the shady as
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just pay more money and you can get
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me where it hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember fill out the little pain graph
and we'll give you more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some doctors didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some doctors were pretty tight on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some doctors would not give you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some doctors would blatantly advertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to give extended plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting the screws to that whole
system for four years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of new paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure because it was the first day
of a new system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said lots of new paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part of this that I figured we would
have brought up by now, but haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: touched on specifically is it's attached
to your driver's license now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're asked license registration
and insurance, that information is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a HIPAA violation to put that up
on the screen?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be, I don't, I'm not
worried about it myself, but that's got to
[SPEAKER_01]: concern somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be considered one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I don't like about it is now
that just drastically increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cop comes up, doesn't suspect a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word marijuana never leaves the cop's
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes back to the cruiser, runs your shit,
come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's all the conversation is
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what came up on your ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they can turn this from a didn't
signal that lane change or speeding to a
[SPEAKER_00]: DWAI or a DUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more money for their jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change the whole story just because it
flagged that you're a weed patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have faith that HIPAA protects
me from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but like I said, all right,
so there's a lot of new paperwork,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of new questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to fill out a whole bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like going to a real doctor for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I've been to that doctor
several times or that office, at least it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like going to a whole brand new
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put in, they asked about your
diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked about my exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked about a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it felt a little more legit than it did
in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of weird questions that I
was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just started making check marks,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say extended plant counts
are not going to happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to bring in actual paperwork with
your qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be current.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people in there with stacks of
paperwork and this doctor would not give
[SPEAKER_01]: them extended plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no, I'm afraid of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't qualify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should be able to cover your
needs with the plants you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, there's no point in an extended
plant count anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Colorado capped a household
plant count at 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, statewide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of specific property zone
designations for homesteaders like dig
[SPEAKER_00]: your own well, generate your own power,
raise your own chickens type properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can have more than 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the days of renting a house and
throwing two hoop houses in the backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: and fucking going hog wild with $4.99 have
been over for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that was doing that saw it
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last year, it was allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went hog wild with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super hog wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of negative press in industry-wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black eyes were generated and the heat to
extinguish medical from Colorado just
[SPEAKER_00]: quadrupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doctors are under strict supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Card holders are under substantial more
scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If medical is here in five years,
I'll be shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not want to even talk about and
hear about extended plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you'd bring it up, I didn't even
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for an extended plant
count right now, show up with terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: illness documentation and documentation
that you live in BFE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it ain't happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, it's probably useless
because you're capped anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the sheriff in the county north
of us is going hog wild busting every grow
[SPEAKER_00]: he can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, they're like 2,000
plants, 4,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, it's like 106 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the news reports those the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, dude, that's dude had got
caught with his cloner full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like calm the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because every clone in that 100 site
cloner counts as a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a major grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was millions of dollars in flowers
that were growing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, they just like if
you've got a cutting and a cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: they they assign that as a street value of
twenty five hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just if anyone's got twenty five
hundred bucks for a cutting, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come get some cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no extended plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctor visit was super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the payments happen online.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take cash at the doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very affordable, very affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a pretty generous discount for
being in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division badge, wear that to
[SPEAKER_01]: your appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go see the doctor, show it to the
lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you check out, say, hey, do I get a
discount for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They should give you a deal that should
help you out at least a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I've been going there for,
like I said, that's probably my eighth ish
[SPEAKER_01]: time getting a card from that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone to that doctor in like four
different office spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They move around so frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so they gave me a pretty fair
discount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, it was a super easy, fairly
friendly visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not not no not a lot of fucking drama or
bad time challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, back in the day, it used to be
different because you have to fill out
[SPEAKER_01]: everything by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would give you a blue pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sit there for four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything would have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For four hours just to see the doc,
everything would have to be in a blue pan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you fucked up, they'd have to give
you a new paper because you couldn't make
[SPEAKER_01]: any corrections on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just you're writing super carefully
and then all the there would be so many
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always people that fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the people that work there were
tied up fixing everybody's errors all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to take forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's all on a computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just go make a bunch of clicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure of the final outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if any anything has happened,
but at the time we're recording this,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 420 High Times Cannabis Cup
celebration in San Bernardino is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that's a big deal is because
Thursday there was an announcement made an
[SPEAKER_01]: announcement made that High Times was
denied permits for their event in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event was denied permits for several
reasons for changes in laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they were saying they were going to
let them hold the event, but there would
[SPEAKER_01]: be no consumption because of the change in
California legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then whoever is in charge of running the
dispensaries and medical marijuana centers
[SPEAKER_01]: and marijuana centers in California issued
a statement saying that anybody attending
[SPEAKER_01]: this event would be under scrutiny by that
division.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times went so far as to have security
guards at every entrance checking people
[SPEAKER_01]: and only allowing them to bring in their
legal allowed amount of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are only bringing in an ounce of
flower or eight grams of concentrates or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, people would bring in a
backpack of flower and start hustling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would bring in concentrates and
sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time High Times was only allowing tax
ID businesses to be a part of their event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had to have a real business
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a marijuana business
license to set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you signed up with your application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put in your info.
[SPEAKER_01]: You turned that into High Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you set up your booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that are in charge of the
marijuana control, I can't remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: name of their division.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have written that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those folks are threatening to walk
through the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time I'm recording, it hasn't
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far it's gone off without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what happens when we go from
the Wild Wild West.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was saying that they're letting
people in through these gates and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: checking everybody, but the vendors that
have products that are allowed to come in
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming in through a back gate and able
to set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got product.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how they're making sure no illegal
cannabis sales are happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's rolling his eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stuck in this awkward spot where
we're trying to host an event that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% professional football game,
50% Burning Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to do it 100% in the
football arena venues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way at this point to get the
events that we want to attend,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's consumption, where you can
go around and sample different people's
[SPEAKER_00]: products and enjoy yourself just like you
would at the Great American Beer Fest or
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste of Colorado or any of those other
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: To actually get that event off,
you really need to go to the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere and allow open consumption events.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dream would be to bring a 420 event to
the state fair down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the perfect space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could do it so fucking easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: When High Times was looking for a venue,
I recommended the state fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically laughed in my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state fair and High Times both were
like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them can make a fortune there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of parking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of indoor and or outdoor
buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got places for concerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's endless square footage for
vending, booths of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could walk there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could walk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of indoor outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have all the consumption you
want and never have a building full of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be so easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll never happen for lots of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, licensed cannabis businesses
can't give away anything, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if they go to an event and
only hand out t-shirts and shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still kind of pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to sit there and charge
you a penny for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for the t-shirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so that they're not giving anything
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all product in their computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some legislature at some point were like,
but drug dealers give out free samples to
[SPEAKER_00]: hook patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been the catch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, we're just swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the record people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We watch them buy the CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Friday, when the cannabis cup was
setting up, a lot of people were missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of empty booth spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_01]: About a third of the booths showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event went on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: People came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concerts that were scheduled for
Friday night happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bands performed.
[SPEAKER_01]: People smoked out and had a good time and
watched these bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday, things would not went off
without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were far into Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't checked any news yet because
we've been Mike and I have been together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been on the road and doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I have been hanging out
podcasting and taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was driving to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This story is going to go well past this
weekend, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so nobody has raided or shut down or
walked through the cannabis cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as I'm aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're well into the Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: The events have happened or the awards
have happened by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Saturday, people started setting up
Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the people or a third of the people
showed up Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: People actually started coming and setting
up Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swerve from the Cali Connection was on
Instagram live talking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, fuck you to all these people
that didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a bunch of pussies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cannabis soldiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since when do we need permits to be
cannabis warriors?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do we need a permit for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give a huge shout out not
just to Swerve, but to everybody who still
[SPEAKER_01]: has that cannabis warrior fucking spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting too comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the suits and the bureaucrats and
whoever you want to call them are taking
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gotten involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're losing the passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those people were the people that
were scared to show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were all the people that didn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more to risk now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't start over by getting a job at
Home Depot and just sucking it up for six
[SPEAKER_00]: months and saving your money and going to
get into lights and a fucking fan and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fuck up now and you crash out,
you're out millions to investors.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of every paycheck you earn from
now till you die is going to go to paying
[SPEAKER_00]: those fuckers off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to give huge respect to
all the people that didn't puss out that
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up and said, hey, they're trying to
shut us down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch me do it because that's what I do
because I'm a cannabis soldier,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where our heart is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a lot of respect for those
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect the other folks too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same way, but it's going to take a
lot of soldiers doing what they do to get
[SPEAKER_00]: us to where we want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone in the cannabis community
wants to at least have the option to
[SPEAKER_00]: attend a 420 event or it doesn't even have
to be a 420 event, but that we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: consume at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I go to a baseball game,
I want to be able to go to the smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: section, take a couple of hits off my
bowl, put it away, grab some nachos and go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to my seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't fucking be
[SPEAKER_00]: like half the assholes there are in line
getting beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my earliest memories, and it's part
of the reason I'm not a big fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: organized sports is we were in line to get
nachos and shit and do in front of my dad
[SPEAKER_00]: turned around and just upended four beers
over me and my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do didn't mean to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was out twenty four bucks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got to enjoy the whole game soaked
in so we were like six and eight in like
[SPEAKER_00]: no six and eight year old likes beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky But like that's a hundred
percent cool, and it happens at every
[SPEAKER_00]: event everywhere Why can't there just be a
little section for me to go toke at like
[SPEAKER_00]: I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get no one wanting me to smoke in the
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dick and light up and you don't
be a fucking Rob Corey Like yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't dab right by your kids if you give
me a little section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go there Yeah, probably won't leave
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let us go off to a side thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean There's within reason like if I
can't take a water bottle into a venue I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think you're gonna get away with a
dab rig and a torch But like a vape pen
[SPEAKER_00]: for concentrates or a fucking joint or a
bowl We've been using enjoying these at
[SPEAKER_00]: concerts for all of our lives The idea
that we just make a space for that so we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to do it on the download Why is
that fucking nuts if I had a box seat at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Folsom field in Boulder right those
expensive there 120 bucks a person for a
[SPEAKER_01]: box or you can Rit the whole box for like
3g's or something like that you get that
[SPEAKER_01]: box And they bring out a little fridge
with shit in it, and then you get free
[SPEAKER_01]: food and drinks and shit Those are
semi-private What if should I be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring my rig in there and take some dabs
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you yes, are you probably not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure plenty of people have and I've
had that idea before like I would love
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the torch you guys here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize There's a couple of events
that I'd love to attend and I've thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about like you know what that events worth
Taking the time putting that money aside
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a box You know get eight or ten
friends together put that planning
[SPEAKER_00]: together And I mean if you take a dab rig
and a torch or something where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping rather than burning You're not
gonna offend or annoy or even tip off the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the boxes on either side of you
but For us to get to a point where this
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't happen to have has to happen Half
on the down low like a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to stand up and fight like No
one understands how many of us there are
[SPEAKER_00]: no one understands How the community
operates what we like what we don't like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean a third or more of Americans believe
the propaganda we got in there like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Third of Americans are us a third are in
the middle and don't really give a shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: a third or against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it works And unfortunately
most of us have I mean we've survived by
[SPEAKER_00]: staying hidden and that's good advice in a
lot of places Keep it quiet or end up in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail Perfect rant Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took the biggest dab of some men I
got half a dab sitting across the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so awesome here I'll heat that up
or actually you start heating that up And
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you a little dab Mike is right
you guys we do need a lot more a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting a lot more soldiers But this is
what happens when you get legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: when you regulate something We are going
from an unregulated market where people
[SPEAKER_01]: would bring their backpacks and just
hustle it out to a taxed Regulated I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to kill Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving him a way too big of a dab to a
taxed regulated market We kind of voted
[SPEAKER_00]: for this we kind of asked for this I
talked about it as a consumer I want it
[SPEAKER_00]: like I want the but I'm buying to have a
Pride or part of its price be lab testing
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, like I like knowing that my shit
doesn't have mold or yeast or heavy metals
[SPEAKER_01]: or pesticides So what I was getting at is
when you guys are voting and setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules and regulations for legal
cannabis in your area What we got to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: include somewhere to consume put
consumption in your rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we missed here That's what
they missed a big fight in Colorado for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last year has been consumption and
we're not gonna win for another four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five years Like Mike said there are so
many places where we can gather Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: was a beer state Colorado Loves beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's beer everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can gather everywhere You can go to the
state fair and buy a big-ass beer and walk
[SPEAKER_01]: around the state fair and drink a beer
There's kids there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Mike said at the fucking baseball
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got beer spilled on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a kid It's unfair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna have to write that into
your rules that there is somewhere where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can suit consume We can buy cannabis
we can grow we can gift we can share we
[SPEAKER_01]: can everything but ship and transport
Export cannabis or you could do it all
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's gonna die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna turn down your mic But we can't
consume it anywhere You're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume cannabis anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you were from out of state You
can't consume in your hotel You've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: get an Airbnb is the only way you can do
it and you've even got to ask the Airbnb
[SPEAKER_01]: people Can we smoke weed in your house and
a lot of them before you even rent it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It will say no cannabis right on the page
when you're trying to rent so That make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that when you're writing the rules in
your area I'm gonna get your mic back on
[SPEAKER_01]: for you Mike Make sure that when you're
writing the rules that when you're setting
[SPEAKER_01]: up the legislation For cannabis in your
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you include some sort of
way to consume Maybe you allow some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of smoke clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let don't make it to where we're
allowed to smoke weed in the park at 420
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that be an adult make a
designated area if you want it to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pass it has to be smart Something like
Jeff's talking about would have to be Is a
[SPEAKER_00]: state rule it would have to allow local
municipalities to opt in or out or define
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how they wanted it to play in
their area, but Honestly, I see this
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving Sort of like bars in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be a member or I mean maybe
following the sex club model Where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: way the fuck out in the middle of nowhere
and it's only word-of-mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no advertising but like the
community needs a place to gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and We don't have that now at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Stomping down on events hardcore
right now think about man I wish and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the wrong audience because these people
all agree with us But just think about
[SPEAKER_01]: this you've got your local bar,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just gonna say it's a biker bar
because that's really good for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: visualize You got this little janky shanty
biker bar with some fucking loud ass rock
[SPEAKER_01]: and roll band I was probably in it playing
in the backyard too loud at midnight
[SPEAKER_01]: playing fucking Mustang Sally or seek and
destroy way too loud with motorcycles all
[SPEAKER_01]: wind up around the building All night long
right or or you could have a little 420
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly club, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bunch of Volkswagen buses outside a bunch
of people just chilling listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead inside smells like nachos
They don't get a lot of press so if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not me you don't see a lot of it or if
you're not like me You don't see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now the anti-pop people their
message is that the high potency products
[SPEAKER_00]: of today Cause mental illness and
psychosis in like all the mass shooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they smoked weed Yeah Already
this fucking the Waffle House dude from
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, yeah, he visited Colorado
when he wasn't wearing pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been the weed like And yeah,
I chuckle because anyone in the community
[SPEAKER_00]: knows it's insane we've been at the
concert with 1500 people smoking pot in a
[SPEAKER_00]: concert venue that holds seven or eight
thousand fifteen hundred two thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: people sit there puffin if consuming
marijuana just cause people to pop off
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a fucking notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what keeps us from popping
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what keeps us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it keeps us in our place, but For
people that have never been part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: community in I mean I lose sight of it too
because I'm such a So ingrained into the
[SPEAKER_00]: community like it's I I get up I it's part
of my breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I do all the time All day at
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I do when I get home Like I eat
sleep and breathe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah but a lot of people don't like there
are people that eat sleep and breathe
[SPEAKER_00]: football or advertising or newspapers that
don't know any really know anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: our community and when they see shit like
High potency weed causes psychosis They go
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of makes sense And there's not a
voice for most people opposing that and so
[SPEAKER_00]: just I mean Getting out and just finding
those people and being like hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like dabs Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking normal and I show up to my job
five days a week and I do a good job while
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here and Like it's just an intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different than alcohol that I
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Anything miraculous or scary or
frightening like please don't outlaw me
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's a hard comment conversation to
have in parts of the country where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's illegal, but If you want shit
to progress Like little by little you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to start breaking down assumptions and
prejudices and It starts by being like hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm completely normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can say that this Mendo breath Is some
of the best concentrates on the planet,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I'm not saying that this would
win the best concentrate, but this is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the category I mean this would be the the
fun part about being in Colorado is I can
[SPEAKER_00]: Confidently and honestly say that right
now at the table that I'm sitting at some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the finest concentrates in the history
of humankind Yeah, yeah, and it's I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not brahman.
[SPEAKER_01]: This my point isn't bragging right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got I'm bragging a little there's
12 grams of hash on the table different
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors different vendors different brands
different consistencies We've got others
[SPEAKER_01]: more over there Mike brought some also
We've got concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the best concentrates did this
green dot fucking white Durbin this could
[SPEAKER_01]: win a This fucking star killer star child
could win an award Mendo breath award
[SPEAKER_01]: winner all of these could do something
this fucking King Louie put me on my ass
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably took Six dabs before we
recorded like reasonably six days each
[SPEAKER_01]: because I bought there's there's seven
containers here We tried almost all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them right in front of me, and then
there's the we tried this one for sure We
[SPEAKER_01]: tried we didn't try this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried almost everything I bought today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried so we've had two four Six seven
we've had at least seven dads You feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like going crazy yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No just chilling I say that all the time I
go ooh is that the weed psychosis that I
[SPEAKER_00]: always hear about yeah I could go for it's
not a thing It's if you if you really dig
[SPEAKER_00]: into the research what they're talking
about is when you get to the hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had way too much weed and you're
freaking out and you insist your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: take you to the hospital Because you're
definitely having a heart attack And you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the hospital and they're like you
know what year it is and you're like yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: And you tell them and they're like okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you been sitting in this
office?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like oh man like half an hour
45 minutes, and it's only been like four
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you being baked Yeah,
that's the effects of the intoxication,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's when they say that you're
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Not being able to accurately gauge
time is part of being psychotic Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, and so like it could it's part of a
mental illness, and it's it's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons that Doctors are able to say oh we
see weed psychosis all the time And it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like well you see being high yeah like I
can't keep track of time if I take booze
[SPEAKER_00]: drinks either I said take booze drinks and
Sometimes this shit can get pretty extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've got Some amazing shit right
now and every now and then someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: never smoked weed before It's like I want
to take a really big dab like I see him do
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube And so they go to the
dispensary they buy a torch they buy a rig
[SPEAKER_00]: they buy a gram a hash they go home they
try to take a half gram dab they cough For
[SPEAKER_00]: five minutes they lay down on the floor
they sit back up and they freak the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: out But it's no different than when you
were a teenager And you drank too much and
[SPEAKER_00]: then threw up all over your cousin and
then blacked out and now you can't drink
[SPEAKER_00]: sour apple pucker no more Like it's no
fucking different, but because this
[SPEAKER_00]: community hides so well It just plays out
so fucking terribly in the press I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just checking the labels on some of the
concentrates that I grabbed today that one
[SPEAKER_01]: is 92% THC mm-hmm this one They're all
crumpled up because the way they stick
[SPEAKER_01]: them on the jar, but total cannabinoids
that one only says 78 total 72 Here we go
[SPEAKER_01]: 95% this is the Lucinda Williams high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract the jar
[SPEAKER_00]: now It was so sexy we took pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically one giant diamond that
weighed a gram and it's 95% total fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: space rock So we're smoking the fucking
the concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed pills a hundred percent THC set
of X city Vex I know that one the Marin
[SPEAKER_00]: all is what I was so drug drug bib and all
or whatever the fuck the Marin all the
[SPEAKER_00]: knockoff is Marin all is the trade name
But sad effects is up if it's the one I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of it's the whole plant extract
They just got FDA with the next step of
[SPEAKER_00]: FBA approval cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a good thing Yeah, I think that
one was from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from out of Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paying attention GW pharmaceuticals If
you've watched like the CNN We've won two
[SPEAKER_00]: and three specials and a couple other
documentaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen the GW pharmaceuticals garden
and labs We have a link to that garden.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah anyway Mike I wanted to give you the
opportunity to talk about all the Trump
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff going on We've been recording for
quite a while if you want to go give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: good 10 or 15 minutes I don't need nearly
that long All right Okay, so everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: excited Trump came out pro weed Is how
it's kind of being thrown around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and that's sort of what happened
But do you never trust somebody who's that
[SPEAKER_00]: orange and who says this amount of
bullshit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard Mike make this noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good news, but it's not that good And
you never know with Trump how much this is
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit and pandering right Or the guy in
the van like how sweet is the puppy at
[SPEAKER_00]: home?
[SPEAKER_00]: You never really know till you get back to
the dudes house,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Evil analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so he's but so that he's gonna
be on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's there's some run-up to this
story like when Jeff Sessions Started
[SPEAKER_00]: really screwing with legal marijuana
states and really started threatening a
[SPEAKER_00]: crackdown of some sort A lot of
politicians said fuck off and and did some
[SPEAKER_00]: things to counter that one of those things
was Colorado Senator Cory Gardner Put a
[SPEAKER_00]: hold on a bunch of nominees It was like
it's part of my job to approve these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to screw with my state's
voters having approved recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis I'm a screw with your nominations
How do you like me now and It's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: stalemate kind of going back and forth
between a couple of different senators
[SPEAKER_00]: doing stuff like Cory Gardner was doing
and the current White House administration
[SPEAKER_00]: over Legal cannabis and it came to a head
last week The long or the short version is
[SPEAKER_00]: it Trump seems like he really wants to
fire somebody but to do that He would need
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardner to approve the replacement and so
to get Gardner to start approving people
[SPEAKER_00]: Replacements in other appointments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that Trump said that he would
support an amendment Similar to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rohrbacher far amendment or the rubach
Rohrbacher Blumeyer amendment that
[SPEAKER_00]: protects medical marijuana Basically that
amendment says the feds can't spend money
[SPEAKER_00]: to go after legal medical marijuana as if
it's following state rules Trump said he
[SPEAKER_00]: would support a similar amendment covering
recreational And throw the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: White House behind an amendment like that
On one hand if Trump is serious and
[SPEAKER_00]: Senators submit that amendment and it
makes it through committee and it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the floor and it gets voted on and it
gets approved by the house and Then it
[SPEAKER_00]: lands on Trump's desk is part of a larger
bill That would provide protections for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of steps between Seven and
yeah, I mean eight steps a lot of shit has
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen before this is anything other
than a fun idea But on the upside It was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a yank on Jeff Sessions leash
saying like This is wildly inappropriate a
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible way to spend resources do
something more interesting And that annoys
[SPEAKER_00]: less people This is the one thing Trump
can do is read a poll like whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: like him or whether you hate him he's
clearly at least employing people who can
[SPEAKER_00]: read public opinion very very well and
Everybody agrees that legalization and
[SPEAKER_00]: liberalization of marijuana laws is very
popular right now So to see the Trump
[SPEAKER_00]: administration have a Jeff Sessions going
after us was surprising Seeing him walk it
[SPEAKER_00]: back was not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely keeping a close eye on
where this goes a Couple of senators have
[SPEAKER_00]: said they'll go ahead and submit That
amendment to protect recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana like we do medical Because
they've struggled to pass a federal
[SPEAKER_00]: spending bill the opportunity to slip that
shit in there is probably still there I
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly haven't been following this as
closely as I should Those of you who like
[SPEAKER_00]: me on the podcast Know that I've got a kid
I'm about to have another kid and so I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been kind of busy and slacking on my
Responsibilities, but I did want to get on
[SPEAKER_01]: and say something about They're called
priorities and you've got them in order
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay earlier in the live feed
somebody was like can can white might do a
[SPEAKER_00]: state-by-state breakdown and how the
non-legalization states are fairing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like I Could I can't right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me like a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need More than a week right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm so behind on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running two facilities instead
of Researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are running 77 and 83 is what we
call them if anybody listening would like
[SPEAKER_00]: further clarification or has specific
questions Feel free to tweet me at an
[SPEAKER_00]: email punk 15 or hit me up on Facebook
Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to interact with you on those
platforms and answer your Political
[SPEAKER_00]: questions political weed questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long You said it's got to jump
through those eight hoops before it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually lands on his desk How do you have
a timeline for that and I'm gonna take a
[SPEAKER_01]: dab so it can happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively quickly like in a matter of
weeks Or it could take a year or two like
[SPEAKER_00]: it just Governments like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay I mean this guy's got a lot of ADD
and it doesn't have anything to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: his dick or his ego So it could get pushed
aside, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's the thing like if this
was something that President Trump decided
[SPEAKER_00]: He was gonna make his number one issue and
he was gonna spend most of his time
[SPEAKER_00]: focused right now on making sure that
Marijuana legalization happened or
[SPEAKER_00]: something it would still take him at least
the rest of it this term To make it happen
[SPEAKER_00]: just with the amount of steps that have to
happen for it to go from Something that
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to make happen to something
that is there's a lot of steps a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: steps you guys I just took a really big
dab of really potent marijuana concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: Still don't feel like fucking anything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was big I might fuck up some ice
cream if you got some Ben and Jerry's that
[SPEAKER_01]: she would be in trouble But that's the
only thing I feel like doing any harm to I
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't moved one of my feet in like an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh You feeling all right over there this
will help this is the sour pez live resin
[SPEAKER_01]: ambrosia It tastes like grapefruit and
cotton candy at the same time kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy fucking honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very terpy I try to get you a nice
crystal and some turps But I know you
[SPEAKER_01]: choke at everything so I didn't go too
hard you guys while I heat up this dab
[SPEAKER_01]: nail I'm gonna try to get it a little
further from the mic so I can talk I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to thank Mike for keeping us up-to-date
politically I know some people get fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: bored appearing about the political rants
and the politics But that is a huge part
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis Activism what's going on being
informed and staying aware is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important Some of you guys might not care
a lot of you really do care So I
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it when Mike comes on shares
that stuff with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super important y'all like When I
hear people say that like they don't vote
[SPEAKER_00]: for this reason or that reason Like I want
to slap them like you would a little kid
[SPEAKER_00]: who was like yanking their sister's hair
Right like there's a lot of times you
[SPEAKER_01]: asked me to edit shit out of the podcast
is that gonna be one of the things no it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just our democracy works because people
participate in it and the reason cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers get shit on by so many different
segments of society is because We haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: participated in the system since the 60s
Get out of the system fuck the system
[SPEAKER_00]: became one of our cornerstone values and
it cost us a lot We never had an organized
[SPEAKER_00]: group fighting for protections or rights
or anything We had exactly the opposite we
[SPEAKER_00]: had An endless number of groups who made a
career out of demonizing our community
[SPEAKER_00]: We're villains in almost every way
Politically and that's because of our
[SPEAKER_00]: non-participation I need to take this
before it gets any colder for far too long
[SPEAKER_01]: our representatives were Cheech and Chong
and that that didn't I love Cheech I love
[SPEAKER_01]: Chong much respect They did a lot if it
was them not their characters in the
[SPEAKER_00]: movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be different, but it was their
characters in the movies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they didn't there was the exact
stereotype that we did not need that was
[SPEAKER_01]: what made people say Well, look at those
burnouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at those stoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we don't want it legal So for
far too long, we had that until the people
[SPEAKER_01]: of our generation I'm gonna kill your mic
just because that's obnoxious Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You okay, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna call 9-1-1 already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me two thumbs up until our generation
came along and I think Things started to
[SPEAKER_01]: change with maybe the kids right before me
and then our generation and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: people after us they feel so entitled that
like we want Legal marijuana so they just
[SPEAKER_01]: went out and fucking tried to make it
happen and it it seems to be working in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the places so it just took time for
people to wake up and then Social media
[SPEAKER_01]: really helped with the activism and waking
up people because a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers advocates speakers We're better
off at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do so well going out So being
able to speak our opinions from the
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort of our own recording studio really
helps us out We made it worse I mean like
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to hide for our own safety and we
preach dropping out and getting out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and fuck Babylon and That allowed
groups to pass all sorts of rules so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if we dared to stand up and identify
ourselves as parts of this community We'd
[SPEAKER_00]: risk school funding housing opportunities
job opportunities Freedom opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah The growers would be arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember reading about grow houses
getting busted when I was like six and
[SPEAKER_00]: eight Where people that were growing under
fucking stolen streetlights in their
[SPEAKER_00]: basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: people cropping out way back in like 92 94
and If you look at the numbers and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: math Like the people's best guess is like
35 to 60 billion dollars in herb gets
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased Coast to coast Wow, and if you
it's about the size of the cosmetics
[SPEAKER_00]: industry And so if you look at I mean just
think about that for a minute How many
[SPEAKER_00]: places do you see cosmetics period like
eyeshadow lipstick all that shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Walgreens Target Walmart fucking
everywhere this scores where I go and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got the places where I got to take
my daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a massive industry, it's everywhere
it requires thousands of companies tens of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of employees a massive amounts
of like trucks and boxes and people and
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping and Now do that with weed so You
can kind of do the math and weed in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area and figure out How many individual
hey, bro Oh, so you'll take an ounce of
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the other than it like how many
of those transactions have to take place
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got a 150 plant house grow how
many of those house grows are required to
[SPEAKER_00]: supply 80% of the demand coast to coast
which is estimated what we're producing
[SPEAKER_00]: coast to coast and 20% import now It used
to be the other way right and slowly the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand for domestic growth has pushed out
the import market, but When you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that commerce shifting that into a
legal market is freaking out all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things and One of the opportunities we
have right now is there's this little
[SPEAKER_00]: window where people who weren't real deep
into the black market Can stand up and
[SPEAKER_00]: fight right now without risking too much
and like I was one Of those people when
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado was on the cusp and I remember
agonizing over Can I be the person who
[SPEAKER_00]: stands up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the odds that you get hammered
down When you're the first one to stand up
[SPEAKER_00]: are huge and in Pueblo the only people
talking for us were really bad at talking
[SPEAKER_00]: for the community and They needed someone
who could put a whole sentence together to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up and speak for legal cannabis and
I attended meeting after meeting where no
[SPEAKER_00]: one showed up and was able to do that and
finally I broke and was like fuck it like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I have to get really creative for
employment from here on out and Just know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm never gonna work for anybody who
does a Google search first Because just
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up and speak about legal cannabis
and the need to legalize it in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: marks you as a target and that's still
true in a lot of the country and So to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the balls to stand up in a place like
Alabama, Georgia, Texas Yeah, and really
[SPEAKER_00]: fight right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it take like soldiers a good word
It takes a set of balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a skill set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes dedication Like you need to be
doing your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know how the process works You
can't go and propose that the people
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking to do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the power to do Please
don't take them marijuana It's just it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a it doesn't go over Well is weird
Like when people come and talk to them
[SPEAKER_00]: about a restaurant they say come to my
restaurant they don't just show up with
[SPEAKER_00]: food Like it should be the same way with
cannabis go tell them what you're about
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know where to come to check out
and find out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just show up and be like here's an
eighth everybody Yeah, I've seen it I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard about it seen it It take your time
if you really want to get up and fight you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know how contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will help how can they contact?
[SPEAKER_00]: You Mike Lots of ways you can hit me up on
Twitter at an email punk 15 or on Facebook

listening to the rants you guys that feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was a lot, but I'm really baked
right now and my ability To judge times
[SPEAKER_00]: little hinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, it's are you psychotic you
falling into that psychosis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called cannabis news education and
conversation and I feel like we got all
[SPEAKER_01]: three today There was news there was
education and there was lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we nailed it I think we did
pretty well if you didn't like this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode the best part What's a dab next if
you didn't like this episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: The best part is there will be another one

couple of different social media platforms

and I don't say those two it's just both
[SPEAKER_00]: of those purges are happening happening
And it's happening for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons It's unfortunate, but at the same
time we're a Community that operates in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shadows and as such we're subject to
getting shit on regularly step out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows Yeah, if they thought they were
gonna receive some sort of backlash for

use a large portion of patreon funding to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a new macbook I've recorded several
episodes on the new macbook pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a lot of youtube videos with it
I cannot believe how much faster how much
[SPEAKER_01]: more quickly it made life better did it

[SPEAKER_00]: lots of rants um keep the questions coming
yeah keep them coming please if you wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: why I took the rant that way 50% of the
time for this episode tonight it's because

the Instagram live feed the Instagram live
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah not Facebook live that's how high I
am that's all right once those are over I
[SPEAKER_01]: forgot them people are like hey remember

[SPEAKER_01]: fast in those I'm fielding four and five
questions at a time right and so my brain
[SPEAKER_01]: is firing in a really weird way and once
it's over I go into like a weird recovery
[SPEAKER_00]: mode I have to watching the lag in person
is funny because I've got the feet up in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me and I see you in person so
sometimes it gets a little hanky I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like when the show when the live feeds are
over the little the driver inside my head
[SPEAKER_01]: has to go put all the files back in the
folders and put them back oh god I needed
[SPEAKER_01]: a minute to put all this shit back that
was so many files at once like yes I just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of decompress after those for a
minute take a couple more dabs and wipe it
