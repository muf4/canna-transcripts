[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have one more important
thing before we can get to my cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hyping up this big growers
meeting at Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a dick because I have to announce
right now that the growers meeting at
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro indoor growing supplies has been
postponed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be April 26th as I've said
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on a new date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beyond my control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am only the messenger here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on that I'm not even
sure about why it's been changed exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's beyond my control to be on Jesse's
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the growers meeting at Hygro indoor
growing supplies has been canceled or
[SPEAKER_00]: postponed is a better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until you hear another date,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sincerely apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking forward to meeting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some shit written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I did write some stuff that I
want to talk about on the podcast in a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said we were going to talk about grow
room scheduling, like planning out a
[SPEAKER_00]: routine and a pattern for your room so
that you can have a productive room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still going to write that out
completely well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that on the podcast
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else do I want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis Cup, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop the music out because
that's highly distracting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just lower that good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bunch of notes because it was a
long weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try to cover a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cannabis Cup was Saturday,
Sunday and Monday in Denver at a place
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's off of 58th and Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off of 58th Street and I-25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say 58th and Washington was where most
of the action was.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of parking, but it was all
fucking a clusterfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost 30 bucks to park in most places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about Friday night because
Friday night's when it all kind of started
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys heard about my Morgan Heritage
concert adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Thursday, I went and got stoned
with the reggae bands and Hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left you guys off on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday night, I packed up, headed to
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rained the entire drive to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 125 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me close to two and a half hours
just to get to the south end of Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove to Garden of Weed and had an
Airbnb spot just outside of Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost to Boulder, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Louisville, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a gorgeous little Airbnb house that
they got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet score, but it was kind of far out of
the way for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I drove out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dabbed out with some of the crew
from Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to meet up with those guys,
hang out with them on a Friday night,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm glad I did because they've been
busy as shit since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hung out, got dabbed out with the
Garden of Weedon crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I headed back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got kind of hungry, got kind of tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I headed back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hotel was super cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was glad I got that room that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a little questioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of questioning on how it was
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was affordable and it was cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great room for one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bed, a couch, a desk,
a TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely turned on the TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it as a nightlight, mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some pizza delivered and I went to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate the shit out of some pizza,
some local pizza that was around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday morning, I woke up kind of early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to the cup around nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about 8.38, 45 when I got to the
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parking lots were starting to get full
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was one spot I found that was
open right away, right near the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost me 30 bucks to park about 30 feet
from the gate that I needed to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I parked my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got myself organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I headed into the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a vendor wristband, so I was able to
get in before everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event doesn't open until noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having the vendor wristband really helped
me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in at nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of neat to see the cannabis cup
come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walked in, it was just a bunch of
empty spaces with square booths and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of walkways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people were emptying everything out of
boxes and everyone was all frantic and
[SPEAKER_00]: moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the smoke fest that you guys
saw, that everybody that went there saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: People looked stressed as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, by noon, the place was packed
and jumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an early... I immediately started
linking up with people that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only took me a few seconds to walk in
and see people that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I need to give a big shout out to
Robert and Anita.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they listen to the podcast
or not, but I have some friends that are
[SPEAKER_00]: local friends I bumped into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big ass line outside the cup,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a vendor entrance and I just
walked right in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody asked me for any credentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never showed a wristband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never showed an ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never showed a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked right in that son of a bitch,
right past everybody, right into the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the cannabis cup at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: while everybody else was waiting in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm a kind guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had bumped into Robert and Anita while I
was in line or while I was walking from
[SPEAKER_00]: the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to actually use a porta
potty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, should I saw my
friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should call them and tell them about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invited them to come join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met them over by another area of
this inside the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they walked around with me for a
little while and hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to Robert and Anita.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for keeping me company for the
first part of the morning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I knew a lot of people there at
the cup and they kind of got annoyed that
[SPEAKER_00]: every 10 feet we would walk, somebody
would bump into me and take a picture with
[SPEAKER_00]: us and hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to go cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they ditched me, which they didn't
really ditch me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me they were taking off,
which was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Robert and Anita took off and had fun,
left me wandering around for myself for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bumped into so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I went to a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran into Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: from Nogu Nonstick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a cool booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And his crew said hi to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the back of their booth,
they shared a booth with some other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these fellers, man, I feel like a dick
right now because there were two brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: that looked fairly, very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them confused multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned them by the end of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one dude's name was Ari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a brother with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was another guy that looked very
much like Ari.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me, you can hear the parchment
paper right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a little, everyone's given
out their shatter in these little
[SPEAKER_00]: envelopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little, I think they used to be for
coin trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little coin envelopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is labeled MOT Extractions Cheese
Nug Run, one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they gave me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've still got quite a bit of it left.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm gonna do right now for you guys,
for MOT Extractions, I'm gonna take a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: of this Cheese Nug Run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly already know that I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanna take a dab of it and tell you
what, oh, that's too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take this medium sized dab on
the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some MOT Extractions Nug
Run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first dab that I took at the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was how I walked into the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I was introduced with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna take a dab of it and we'll
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a nice chunky sized dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't too ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good and chunky though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is very smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste like cheese to me or the
strain the cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get kind of a, there's some sweetness to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little bit of funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the cheese is setting in now
that it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My tongue is kind of absorbing it a
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cotton mouth thing is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta take a drink by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely the hint of the cheese
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little funk, a little sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely gonna smoke the rest of
this ground that they gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a nice mellow indica high.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes got droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The appearance, it's super clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right between shatter and snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've had it for several days
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in my car for a day and it's still
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give a positive thumbs up shout
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Rost and Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: MOT Extractions Cheese Nugron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find them on Instagram or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll follow you guys after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I approve of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out for all the morning dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me find my notes I took here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly have notes because I'm trying
to cover all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I bumped into my friend Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Jay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to at DreadfulJay on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my buddy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thought that was my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she lives in Cali and I live in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she can really, you know, that'd be
awkward to have a girlfriend so far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if she stays, my friend will
be best friends forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't fuck that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, shout out to Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I bumped into her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumped into her shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ran from across the cup and tackled
hugged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She jumped up and latched up onto me and
gave me the biggest sweetest hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen her in a year, so it was
great to get that hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, mama?
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only been gone for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jay and I raged the cup for most of the
first day together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked around selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a box of seeds and I wore an irie
genetics t-shirt and put my dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_00]: down and just walked with my box of seeds
and I sold plenty of packs of seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did spend some time at the Sour Seeds
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Rob at the Sour Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Rusty at Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first day I spent some time at that
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I had more seed sales by
walking around and I got to see more
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I abandoned the booth idea and just
went and mingled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also got a lot of compliments on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected more reaction to the seeds and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought people would be more interested
in my beans, but a lot of people knew who
[SPEAKER_00]: I was because of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of neat that this podcast has
reached the same amount of notoriety as
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even using the notes anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just fucking rambling to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to talk about my show or talk about
my experience on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I am reading notes and talking now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I headed back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of compliments on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the cannabis cup, it got cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got fucking cold, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All weekend the weather kept changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I headed back to the hotel room to warm
up, get some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate some of that pizza that I had left
over from the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty dankalicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually took a couple fatty dabs and
fell asleep for a couple hours because I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was up early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, I woke up and I headed to
a private party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a private party outside the
Oriental Theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we weren't able to smoke in the
theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even made it inside the theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it was loud as shit and crowded,
but we weren't able to smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the fire department, the police,
and the MED were all doing random
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections on clubs that weekend to see
who was smoking, because they knew people
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to be smoking in clubs,
and it's illegal to smoke in places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't allowed to smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found a way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess since the party's over,
excuse me, I'm burping, I guess since the
[SPEAKER_00]: party's over, I could blow up the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside the theater, these people parked
two tour buses.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the tour buses had a private party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the bus is private, nobody can
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tell us that we can't smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops aren't even welcome on the bus
without a warrant, or unless a crime
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fire department has no damn reason,
and the MED is definitely not coming on a
[SPEAKER_00]: private tour bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of our friends, I don't want to
say their names, but big shout out for you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking smooth of you to pull it
off that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up tour buses, and we just went
up on the tour buses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to be kind of invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to know what was up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a Facebook and a text message
saying, hey, bro, this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on these buses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went up on the bus, dabbed out in
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bong going.
[SPEAKER_00]: One tour bus was set up like a party bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bong going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were serving drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a full-on DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other bus was being used for a
private, breeders-only seed swap type of
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go in there and meet a bunch of
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Horse Genetics was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that just bred the cherry afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I wish I could remember your name,
because that shit smelled delicious,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were just swapping seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a little seed sales going on
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great, but it got kind of late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give some of my seeds to some
really respectful people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Spliff of cannabis has some,
or Mr. Spliff of, now he's of Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mr. Spliff has some of my beans now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be growing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went back to my hotel to gear up for
day two, because this was only the first
[SPEAKER_00]: day of the cup, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet up with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to list all the people
that I saw, because I will forget more
[SPEAKER_00]: people than I remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge weekend, and I got a
sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recently had a head injury,
and I feel like I don't remember as much
[SPEAKER_00]: shit as I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Sunday, I slept in a little,
because I wore myself out Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely was exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slept in a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I headed to the cup around lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the grocery store and got a
bunch of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I had the vendor wristband,
I was able to take some fruit and some
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy drinks into my backpack with me
and sneak those in, because I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a security thing to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the normal people had to go through
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the little VIP vendor pass,
so I just got to walk right past all that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, that dab is working, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cheese nugget is definitely kicking
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I slept in a little, took some
fruit with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me about an hour to park that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I got to the 58th Street exit,
traffic was already backed up on the exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me 15 minutes to get from the
exit to the parking areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to drive around for another
20 or 30 to find a parking spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the parking cost me 20 or 30 bucks
each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got into the cup, I wandered around,
and then eventually I bumped into Jay
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her and I walked around the cup and bumped
into a bunch of friends until we decided
[SPEAKER_00]: we needed some serious dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the cannabis cup, you'd think there's a
lot of places to hang out and take some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs, but there was really not a lot of
comfy places to just chill out and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some VIP areas and shit,
but they fill up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Jay and I, Julie,
we found a loading dock area and we made a
[SPEAKER_00]: little dab area for ourselves and got
comfy there and just dabbed out and took a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of selfies and had a good time for a
few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunday was a really fun day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more relaxed than Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday was kind of crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hustle and bustle because
everyone's trying to meet up with all
[SPEAKER_00]: their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the first day of school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a lot of those people in
close to a year, if not a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was mostly bumping into friends and
hanging out with Jay until the evening
[SPEAKER_00]: when we headed to the award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the award ceremony was Saturday
night, so it was a three day event,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get fucked up on that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you do the awards at the last day,
but they didn't, which we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: something on that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until the award ceremony, the highlight
of my day was probably hanging out and
[SPEAKER_00]: eating lunch with Addison DeMora.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lines were really long at all the food
trucks, but there's one food truck that
[SPEAKER_00]: serves organic gluten-free food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because there's chicken
legs, hot dogs, burgers, French fries,
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of food trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle, there's this one
little baby blue food truck that sells
[SPEAKER_00]: salads for nine bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a salad with some chopped up
strawberries and some blueberries and some
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit that I couldn't identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know what the hell it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the bottom, there were chunks
of feta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time I stirred it,
I found another layer of goodness in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but there was honey all over it for
dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nine bucks, but that was like the
most edible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegetarian and I try to eat well,
so that was the most edible stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that line was two people long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two people in front of me,
and I had my food in less than like five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay wanted some food from another cart,
and she waited in line for the entire time
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was in line, plus the time that I
ate my food, plus a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people walked by and saw me at a
table, and I was sitting at a table where
[SPEAKER_00]: four people could fit, and they saw me
there by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, hey, dude, can we eat
with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, shit, yeah,
you got plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people ate their meals,
cleaned up after themselves, shook my
[SPEAKER_00]: hand, said goodbye, and took off before
Jay even got her food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long some of the food lines
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I'm sitting by the organic food
truck eating my food, my buddy Addison
[SPEAKER_00]: Demora walked up and sat down,
or ordered food at the food truck,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then after that he came and sat down
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having lunch with Addie
might've been my highlight of my afternoon
[SPEAKER_00]: up until the awards ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addison is a busy man, and it seems like
everybody at the Cannabis Cup knew him,
[SPEAKER_00]: so getting an hour out of his life for him
to just sit down and hang out,
[SPEAKER_00]: not talk business, to just be my bro for
an hour and hang out, and catch up was
[SPEAKER_00]: really an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Addison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you get to hear this, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a bunch of dabs with Addison and
dabs so hard, and Julie joined us at the
[SPEAKER_00]: table, we made another friend at the
table, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot remember her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name might've been Elise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name was Elise.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a medical cannabis user,
and she uses cannabis for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was just waiting for her friend in
line also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she sat down and ate with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since she ate with me, when she was
done, I gave her some dabs, just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the crew, and she really
appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I misjudged that lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was, I don't even want to guess how
old she was.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was older than me, and she seemed all
nice and kind, but she took a dab like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should've given her larger dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the bunch of dabs, it was time
for the award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: The award ceremony was really neat,
and it's kind of chaos, like High Times
[SPEAKER_00]: always is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first award, they made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They announced the third place is the
first place, and the first place is the
[SPEAKER_00]: third place, and it was always already
chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how High Times likes to do
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they finally got their shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vader won the first three awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that really stood out to me
was when High Times brought out two
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the Jamaican Ganja Farmers
Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy was, he had short hair and wore a
jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other guy was taller and had
dreadlocks to his ass, and he was the
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of the Rasta community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys spoke about legalization in
Jamaica, and they announced that the High
[SPEAKER_00]: Times would be hosting a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the island of Jamaica in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking about going, but honestly,
I don't know if I wanna travel to Jamaica
[SPEAKER_00]: for a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be the most financially sound
idea, but you gotta do what you gotta do
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things I'm thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I thought was funny,
when the Jamaican came out, the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, the Rasta, started speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Greetings in the name of the Most
High, His Imperial Majesty, King Haile
[SPEAKER_00]: Selassie, I the First, Jah, and all of the
Rastas in the room yelled Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a guy behind me bumped his buddy on
the shoulder and said, what did he just
[SPEAKER_00]: say?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I jokingly turned back and politely
said, he said hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was pretty funny,
because the dude behind me had no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what this old Rasta man just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really excited to see a Rasta man
come out at the cannabis cup and tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's gonna be a cannabis cup in
Jamaica in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kinda neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to see some true Rastas come out and
get to celebrate Rastafari at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cup was nice also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud as fuck to announce that Spencer
and Maddie from the Garden of Whedon won
[SPEAKER_00]: first place for best CBD concentrate at
the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we've had a cannabis cup winner
on this podcast now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first female to come to record at my
house and be on the podcast is also a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cup winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the CBD extract category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud as shit for my crew,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that head wound, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't feel good for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to Spencer's to go kick back
just to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had just made the cup entry and
he's like, try this dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my CBD entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hit it and it tasted like I'd just
bit into oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like I had a mouthful of
delicious sweet oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm drooling now and I kinda want an
orange because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I blew it out and I had a concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt like I had a belt tied around
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like just pressure around my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I blew out this dab, it felt like
you undid the belt a couple of notches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he gave me a couple of more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at him and I was like,
bro, I am the most comfortable right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've been in several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was in pain and my head hurt and I
wasn't feeling right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those dabs like set me right,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me, he said, you look like
you're the best you've been in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I guess people could physically see
that I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize I was showing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those dabs were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Spence, big shout out
to Maddie, much love to the entire squad
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Garden of Wheaton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mike, Fong, Sloppy, everybody,
Siroc and Nana, everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all you guys doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super fucking proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a chance to visit them since
the Cannabis Cup victory, but I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence, if you're listening, bro,
you know you gotta come be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't even bothered them about it
yet, you guys, because it's only been a
[SPEAKER_00]: few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the Cup, everyone's just getting
home, getting back to our normal routines,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting our dogs loved on, getting our
plants caught up, catching up with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends here back where we live and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second place in the same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of proud of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to our friends, Joey and Shelley
at Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs with their CBD entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it on a screen far away here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you what they entered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a second and
I'm going to pull up the winners here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer is kind of far out of reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I had to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second place winner in the Best CBD
Concentrate went to Natural Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Caregivers with their Cannatonic,
which actually is a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the episode I did with
Angela about CBD medicine, Cannatonic
[SPEAKER_00]: might've been the culprit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the high CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you the third place,
since we're on the whole category,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Industrial Hemp CBD Extract with,
oh, that looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Isodiol SA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like any cannabis product
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like white powdery substances
that I don't even want to tell you what it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like drugs, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you showed up with that and you put
that on my table, I'd tell you to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so big shout out to Joey and
Shelley at the Natural Mystic Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I need to give a huge big shout out
to my friend Noah at Champion Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what they actually call
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they go by Champion Cannabis,
but their dispensary one is a different
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scrolling up through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just want me to read all of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to go through and read
all of the winners of the 2015 High Times
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cup in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go kind of quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm reading this all off the High
Times website, so if anything goes wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, it's on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my friend Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Noah, Champion Cannabis,
Greenway Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hear more of them as we go through
these winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my friend Noah beat the shit out of

was limited to Colorado dispensaries is
[SPEAKER_00]: how I heard it explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best Colorado hybrid flower was,
first place, Kong from All Greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to Jessica.

Concentrate.

that on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the stuff if you're looking for
terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, Wonderland Live Resin Green
Wolf LA with Dabalicious Crockett Family

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll explain that on another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichome Heavy Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another extract ran by a lady right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I find it weird that Keef Cola was a
sponsor and also won first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that's fucking fair at
all, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be able to enter and be a
sponsor, is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, Afghado Bar from
Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a hell of a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promote that.

[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third place, Orange Cream Sickle Cream Pop
from Sacred Sweets and Trichome Heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts in a collaboration effort with
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get to try that, but I have had
other Sacred Sweets products and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: always delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put out some stars, some Star of
David shaped products that are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best Topical, Angel Salve Champion
Cannabis with Evo Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my friends from Las Vegas
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, Hygasm, Genesis Compound and
Essences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygasm, the product packages they show
here show that it's an edible personal
[SPEAKER_00]: lubricant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one package that says Hygasm and
the package has a green logo and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one next to it that is yellow or
with a yellow highlighted label and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled Coconut, C-O-C-K-O-Nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third product is labeled Hygasm and
the label is a little bit purplish and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor is Blowberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are flavored, edible personal
lubricants that are infused with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our second place winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third place winner was Floria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, we talked about Floria on a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging says Pleasure with Anne.
[SPEAKER_00]: So best CBD flower was Tora Bora from MMJ
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the shit out of some Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, the Nubia from Aficionado
Freeborn Selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third place, Sleeping Giant from Elemental
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is where we move on to best CBD
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been here before.
[SPEAKER_00]: First place, OG Tonic from the Smokers
Club in collaboration with the Garden of
[SPEAKER_00]: Weedan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Smokers Club was the sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Garden of Weedan was the grower and
the extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all done by Spence, Matty and the
Garden of Weedan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to those guys again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome that they live in my
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put this little town on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've only lived in Colorado for two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came here with the mission and
they're fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So second place was Kana Tonic from
Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to go to a dispensary for CBD
medicine, I either recommend the Green and
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy Cannabis or Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only two spots I'd send you
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both medical shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only places to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the third place that is
Industrial Hemp CBD Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we move on to best CBD edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the honor of meeting the guy from
Fox Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude made a 160 milligram banana
pudding bar in collaboration with Shoemelt
[SPEAKER_00]: and it won first place in the best CBD
edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, I ate three squares of that
thing and it's 160 milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's divided into eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even gonna do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 20, 40, 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate 60 milligrams of that thing and I
was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty high from that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't like high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like rubbery and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was quiet and mellow for most of the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why Saturday was so mellow
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second place was Rocky CBD Enriched
Premium Protein Bar from TC Labs and TC
[SPEAKER_00]: Treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third place was Cherry Drops Tincture
from Great Lakes Hemp Supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on to best booth.

[SPEAKER_00]: People's Choice Flowers, Cindy White from
the Green Solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, Grizz Kush from Native
Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third place, Bubba Kush from the Clinic
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: People's Choice Concentrates, Sour Diesel
Shatter took first place from the Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, Kosher Kush Live Resin
Butter from the Clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that's delicious because I love
their Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third place, Orange Heroana Shatter from
Native Roots Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, those are all of the winners
from the 2015 High Times U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me read all those to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a minute and I stumbled a lot,
but I hope you appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see where I was in my notes
because I just totally got sidetracked and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like 35 minutes into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fix this microphone so it'll
quit wobbling too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get my iPhone to unlock,
we could really do a lot more business
[SPEAKER_00]: with this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, dude, that banana pudding edible
that I ate was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did it wreck me, but it was
amazingly delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they gave me a bunch of those and just
set it next to me, I would be really high
[SPEAKER_00]: because they taste too good to stop
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all my friends that got
cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody that won a cannabis
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be surrounded by cup
winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the Cup Sunday, I was treated to
a super tasty dinner at the Yard House
[SPEAKER_00]: with a few friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Yard House is on the 16th Street Mall
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super tasty place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vibe is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely go back there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a pizza from there and I also had
the Angel Hair Pasta meal from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Dean is a meat-eating heathen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just picking on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys that eat meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, I don't judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a burger and dude, it looked
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That burger was like a foot tall off the
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that dude was able to eat
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned Vader, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something that I found
kind of disrespectful at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: A company called Vader won several awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won the first three awards that were
given away at the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a huge setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a place called Vader Village in
the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge setup with a stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had live musical acts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had semi-famous celebrities at the
booths all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Adam Hill was there launching
prizes into the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the t-shirt gun, the t-shirt
cannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would fill it up with packages of
shatter and launch and joints and bags of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and launch bags of weed and shatter
and joints into the crowd of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would go nuts and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they win best booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won all kinds of prizes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cup happened Sunday or Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was Sunday night when they win
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday is 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's stoked, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We show up for the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vader Village is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have taken down their entire booth,
tore down everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they win and they just take all their
shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won several awards and they packed up
at night while everyone was asleep and
[SPEAKER_00]: they took off Monday before the cup opened
at noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just seems disrespectful to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're going to come to a
competition, if you're going to come to an
[SPEAKER_00]: event, and you're going to build a big ass
stage and make a big spectacle,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out for the last day and play with
all the cool kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dick and leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found that disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even my event, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congrats on all your wins, Vader,
but that was not a classy move to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads me into Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday was day three of the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday was 420 and the place was super
crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather had been sketchy all weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some points I was wondering I was
wearing a t-shirt and I was sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other times I had a hoodie on
with my hood up and I was freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weather was super sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday had a nice break in the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it felt like everybody showed up for
the last part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like around three o'clock it got pretty
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place was stupid crowded for 420,
on 420, at 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got there around lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I milled around, said goodbye to everyone
that I hung out with because I only see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these people once a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these seed companies, all my friends
from the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only meet up like once a year because
this is where everybody is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pretty much said goodbye to everybody
I got to hang out with, went and visited a
[SPEAKER_00]: few booths, picked up a couple of pieces
of merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, the only thing I really
bought, oh man, I got to give a huge shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I write this down?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all my other notes, so I'll skip
that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more notes to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just milled around, said goodbye to
everybody, ate some food, got dabbed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: gave everybody a bunch of hugs,
hung out with Jules, hung out with Dean,
[SPEAKER_00]: got to hang out with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Addison, Gage Green, Mr. Spliff,
saw a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw a lot of cool ass people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really describe it other than
it was an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a state fair or any
other trade show, but add the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and extracts on the planet and
then a thousand of your favorite friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what the cup is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Aaron Brooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost forgot that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a pleasant surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Aaron Brooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does some neat shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was Monday at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the cup, I headed to the Mellow
Mushroom to meet up with a few friends of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine because Doug Benson was in town doing
a comedy show at ComedyWorks, recording
[SPEAKER_00]: his next comedy special that he has
titled, what the hell did he call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Promotional Tool is the name of his new
album.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see him record that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of got some hookups at the
ComedyWorks, so I might've been sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to ComedyWorks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole ComedyWorks crew
for treating me like royalty every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to leave you guys off on my
cannabis cup recap by saying that it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great seeing everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if I got to see you there,
thanks for shaking my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for walking up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for talking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for meeting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of gifts here that I
should talk about, but I'm going to wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: up this part and we're going to move on to
a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Clint that has been on the show
is going to show up tomorrow night and
[SPEAKER_00]: record with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will talk about our experience at
the Doug Benson comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will also talk about, we saw Greg
Proops record a podcast Wednesday night at
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also got to hang out with Greg
Proops and in Guy Obelam after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about that with Clint on the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, I got to jump back to the notes
so I don't skip anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the next part that I want to
do is I'm going to do a couple of shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Josh, my friend Josh won second place
in the Adam Dunn Show Invitational,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was kind of a private grow
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh, dude, huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you listen to the episode
or the podcast, like every episode
[SPEAKER_00]: religiously, but when you finally do hear
this, because I'm sure you're behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you finally hear this, dude,
huge shout out and congrats for winning
[SPEAKER_00]: the Adam Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took second place, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his first competition he's ever
entered and he took second place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, the dude's killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He should be proud of himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, take dabs and review them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's the part I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it pays to be Ross DeJeff and
have a little podcast because while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Cannabis Cup, somebody walked up to
me and this happened two days in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walked up to me and he handed me these
little packages and it says Electrum
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to pull this whole thing
out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in little smelly proof bags and
it's got the smelly proof logo right over
[SPEAKER_00]: his logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take it out so I could see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Electrum Extracts and you unfold
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, it says Lemon Skunk
times Banana Kush contains 100% organic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole plant extracted via N-butane
N-propane mix in a closed loop extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his Instagram, check this out,
is Electrum Extracts, E-L-E-C-T-R-U-M
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says not for use by children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he gave me here, he handed me some
butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing, some B-H-O,
some dabs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he said was I want you to try
this on the show and let me know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try the Lemon Skunk Banana
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reaching for all my tools right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cleaning off the carb cap,
unwrapping the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice friendly portion he gave me
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already dabbed a few dabs so I don't
remember what it would have weighed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to take a decent sized dab
here and then we'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Electrum Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Lemon Skunk Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some dabs, dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, two, one, dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it tastes good on the way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you don't taste good smoke until
the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tastes citrusy and lemony on the way
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely taste the lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't taste the Banana Kush part,
but I taste the Lemon Skunk for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's something I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these Lemon Skunk strains,
I've got a Lemon Skunk plant that I bred
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Golden Goat made Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I make dabs out of the Lemon
Skunk or the Lemon Jeffrey, it makes my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes bounce up and down a little bit for a
second, like when you're driving down a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up, graded dirt road and your eyes
just go... This Lemon Skunk Banana Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: dab just made my eyes do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good sativa high from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Electrum Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do approve of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take dabs of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's available somewhere,
I want some more of that Lemon Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tasty, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for giving me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just walked up to me and he's like,
my friend said he had a podcast and I
[SPEAKER_00]: should give this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit works out sometimes when you're off
to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me another one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we try it on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be silly not to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is Rare Dankness Sativa Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is just going to be straight a
head ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried this one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfolding it, looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticking to the parchment a little
more than the other one did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but it's got a nice amber-y color to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smelling it off the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an odd flavor, kind of a lime,
more lime than what I'm used to in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going to get a nice
flavor out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, guys, join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Sativa Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contains 100% organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says whole plant extracted via.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that you just chuck the,
cut the buds off the sticks and do like
[SPEAKER_00]: fan leaves and nugs all at once?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that with my CBD medicine,
so you get that full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just curious what that whole plant they're
hinting at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that lime flavor catches me,
but
[SPEAKER_00]: this one's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's Sativa too, because my head is
just going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely both of those were smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them had a nice texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them were well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much of a lime flavor on this
Rare Dankness one for me, but it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, that's a great hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I don't give this one a
perfect 10 is because the lime thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: not my flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange flavored one or the lemony
flavored one wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do give you a thumbs up on both of
these overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrum Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys win, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for giving me hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you guys gave me hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love when people walk up to me and give
me stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about the Edibles I ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to a comedy show, and we're
going to talk about that more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to give a shout out while I'm
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw Doug Benson Monday night on my
way into the show, I ate a Claudi bear
[SPEAKER_00]: because my friend Claude the Candy Man
from Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Sweet Snow Candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Claude gave me a banana Claudi bear that
was dipped in chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know me, you know I freaking
love banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also know that I love chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a hundred milligram edible dipped,
there was banana flavor dipped in
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate was the perfect fucking gift for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Claude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That edible worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super stoned and super smiley for
the whole comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wednesday night, I saw Greg Proops and
I ate a 100 milligram watermelon candy for
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use only.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says indica on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says contains two pieces at 50
milligrams each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what these guys didn't do,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not put any sort of branding on
here, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to hit Instagram right
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see if I have the message
where he asked me if I ate the edible yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I found him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Ryan is made of cannabis on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude gave me this edible and it's
a Lego man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually two Lego man.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 milligrams each and I ate both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at dinner at the Mellow Mushroom
and I tore them open while I was waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: for the pizza to come and ate these
suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't eat gummies just because
of, I'm just a picky sucker when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to my diet, but these are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The watermelon candy flavor was pretty
damn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I liked them and I was definitely high
for the whole comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smiled like a child for the whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Ryan is made of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you gave me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it very, very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go look at the notes again,
because I've got ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going like 47 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, the next episode will be Clint and I
talking about the comedy shows that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: recently gone to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on the grow room schedule
episode that I prepared for Hygro's
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting, which is not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that again, guys,
47 minutes in the meeting and Hygro and
[SPEAKER_00]: our growing supplies has been postponed to
a better time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will let you know when the better time
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to do that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have another episode on improving
your crop real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also have episodes with Jesse doing
outdoor stuff and more organics with Sean.

[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I can't think of his name right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm drawing a complete fucking blank on
Mike's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Hughes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez, I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe I just forgot your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mike Hughes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody from the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that cleaned up after us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That place was a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you guys pick up four pieces of
trash, if they're yours or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I met a ton of cool people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did meet a lot of tons of cool
people, but, and this is serious,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the coolest folks that I met were
