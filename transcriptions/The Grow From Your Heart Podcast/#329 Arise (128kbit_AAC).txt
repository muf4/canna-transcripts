[SPEAKER_00]: All right, make sure you check them out at
dank seed dot store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, you know,
I like to start the podcast off by letting
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I'm smoking on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of some stuff called
sinful bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from contraband concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the in-house concentrate company at a
store in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna pull this out of the container
here and give it a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you guys what I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smell it, it's got a little
funky, like a cookie, cushy kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you dab it, it totally
tastes like banana runts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever had a banana runt or those
little banana shaped candies that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the little machine, you put your
quarter in there, you turn the knob and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the fruit shaped candy comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some banana shapes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this tastes like when you dab
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna grab the little packet here and
we'll read some test results on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice lab test result of 87.8%
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the description is sin mint cookies
and honey bananas blended perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice head stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went right to my eyes, right to my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my shoulders nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice mellow indica stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something new, I haven't tried that
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm digging the sinful bananas sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotta say, I really enjoy the texture
and consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I complain a lot that when I buy sauce,
it's too saucy, which sounds ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's just too much turp water in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer more crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys put plenty of crystals in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crystals aren't tiny, but they're also
not so huge that you're smoking all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gram in two dabs because the crystals are
so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's move forward
with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got a lot of stuff to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody threw down a very large,
generous Patreon contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it was a very generous
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want me to say their name on
the show, but I wanna make sure that I say
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for the very generous
Patreon contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks to everybody else who has
pitched in on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know what I'm talking
about, make sure you check out patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you need will be right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that at the end of the
show again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have a bunch of notes written
down, but I think I'm gonna save a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of them for the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick shout out to Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick shout out to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to get with Mike and do longer
episodes about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I do wanna mention,
you guys, the podcast was ranked 635 on
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 40,000 podcasts available on
Stitcher, and I'm sure there are at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 25 cannabis-related podcasts
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are choosing to listen to my
little show, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I genuinely appreciate the love and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are blowing me up with emails,
with messages, with Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, with Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a lot of fun lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made a bunch of changes in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little concerned about things,
and you guys have reassured me that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for the love and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ranked 635 out of 40,000 shows on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, a lot of people are still
telling me they're having problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher intermittently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randomly Stitcher won't work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there are people trying to
listen that aren't able to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm willing to bet that once I get that
issue corrected, we will get into the top
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all the clicks, all the
listens, all the downloads, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been posting videos up on
YouTube, and you guys have been watching
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I post those videos,
people start watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to say is thank you for
all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never expected a little podcast to get
this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just doing this because I wanted to
talk about weed, I wanted to correct some
[SPEAKER_00]: things I read on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't think I'd get 300 and
something episodes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you guys, I see no end in sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into the main part of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling for about five minutes
and we haven't touched on the main topic
[SPEAKER_00]: of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on
the Strain Report episodes that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, I've done Strain Reports on
Morning Dew, Firefly, and The Cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The responses to those episodes are
overwhelming, and you guys have been
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, we're going to feature Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is one of my proudest creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise and probably Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise and Lemon Jeffrey would rival for
top two with Grateful Dog in there for top
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently, Arise is one of my
favorites to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breeding with Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a male Arise plant that I call
King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is what I've been making a lot of my
fresh creations with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise tests consistently in the high 20s
and low 30% THC-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at Organica in Albuquerque,
New Mexico grew some seeds that I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew the Arise seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had it tested at Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lab test was tested one time and it
revealed 35.84% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steep Hill insisted on testing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they tested it a third time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that third test, they decided to
call and tell our friends at Organica that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had hit 35.84% THC-A and it was the
record of highest THC-A test at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anything is tested higher
than that, but at one point in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise held the record for highest THC lab
test with Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was grown again by our friends at
Organica in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the lab test that makes
me super proud of Arise, although that is
[SPEAKER_00]: bragging rights and that is something I
can show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I nailed what I was going for
when I made the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took an OG Kush, kind of a diesel,
chemi-dominant plant and crossed it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: candy-flavored tropical plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got that perfect 50-50 Indica sativa
balance that seems to work very well
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinally for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to work very well
recreational for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I made a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great cushy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great tropical flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very versatile strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tests high and people have been
reporting great results using it
[SPEAKER_00]: medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it gets me so lit that I
am smoking it recreationally when I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only need one medical dab of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second dab of Arise, that's all
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like the way Arise grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like breeding with Arise like I've
mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is just a great strain to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many great things about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about the
parents of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into the details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents of Arise are a Golden Goat
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is island sweet skunk crossed
to Hawaiian sativa and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people on the internet give me
credit for making Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made Golden Goat and Femini Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not create Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat was made by a guy named Mr.
Dank and it's from Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little knowledge for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about Golden Goat in the future
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is kind of a tropical sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow super tall and it doesn't
grow super skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they crossed all of those
sativas with the Romulan and it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps it short and it kind of lowered the
flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still kept that tropical sativa
flavor and the skinny leaves and that
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat's got some great tropical
candy flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sweet and fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like that gum, some juicy fruit
gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe there used to be these generic
candies that used to just come in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic sleeve and they were kind of
fruity flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what the Golden Goat tastes
like sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is actually named,
here's a little bit of knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is actually named for the
Golden Goat Recycling Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that made Golden Goat lived near a
place called the Golden Goat Recycling
[SPEAKER_00]: Center where people would recycle cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that in the middle of the
summer it made this sticky sweet smell in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that's what the Golden Goat
plant reminded him of and I could see
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fruity and soda can like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had a whole bunch of syrupy soda
that was like, you had some orange soda in
[SPEAKER_00]: there maybe mixing in with all the colas,
it would definitely give you that Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat sweetness kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays short, it stays squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's island sweet skunk and it's Hawaiian
sativa which gives it that tropical flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: in the head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they cross the Romulan in there and
that keeps it short and stocky and makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it grow early or makes it flower early and
finish early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got that candy flavor and a super
sativa head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives some people panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some Golden Goat with the girl
one time and I just had to take her home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the end of that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the female part of a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male, the daddy was Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is Chem D which is gassy,
funky, feedy, kind of burnt rubber,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh tennis ball sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mix for that O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, dirty feet, funk, earth,
coffee sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Daybreaker gives off a diesel-y,
chem-y smelling Kush sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's diesel, Kush, Chem, fuel,
earth, just funky smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirty feet, a little bit of armpits in
there maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Daybreaker has a very nice,
I call it a complete high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really good head buzz because
it's got that Chem D in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got a really heavy body
stone because it's got that Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Daybreaker was a really great
strain but it leaned really heavy on that
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy, cushy, fuely side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw that tropical flavor coming
out of Golden Goat and they both grew with
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice stout structure and I was like that
would make a really beautiful cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what gave me the idea that's
where they came from and that's how it
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we know who the parents are,
we can talk about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a very great balance of Sativa
and Indica with a few phenotypes that lean
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily in one direction which is
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes will finish in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some eight week and some 10
week finishers in the mix because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bring out some of that island
sweet skunk and some of that Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa that's gonna take a little longer
to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna show up in the F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise seeds that you guys are getting
from Dank Seed or from me, those are F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is going to apply to those
F1 Arise seeds that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made F2s but I haven't released
them yet because I haven't done enough
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and I don't wanna see anybody have
any problems and I probably won't release
[SPEAKER_00]: the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll work it to an F3 and then you'll get
some of the F3s and the packages will be
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, you're getting F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get stuff that finishes,
what was I saying, in eight to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite finishes right around day 63
to 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eight week phenotype that you'll find
is very Joseph OG dominant but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce as tight of buds as the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little fluffier and she's not
very high of a yielder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't throw out as much as the other
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 week phenotype shows the Hawaiian
Sativa or the island sweet skunk structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes long skinny buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hawaiian Sativa and the island sweet
skunk, those are gonna get long and
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see that long stretchiness,
expect some tropical smell, some tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, some salt water, some taffy,
some fruit, some pineapple, some oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many weird things that come out
of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that 10 week phenotype is covered in
trichomes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just frosty as shit, soaked in
trichomes but it doesn't produce very
[SPEAKER_00]: dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 week phenotype smells like it's
bringing out all that Hawaiian flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: the goat sweetness and the head high from
the 10 week phenotype is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 10 weeker, if you let her go 10 weeks
and finish out and you're not a seasoned
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or if you're smoking with new
people, it will give them a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear that I say that with a
smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of enjoy panic attack weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather get energized and like,
oh shit, than just wanna sit there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner and hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my favorite phenotypes of Arise are
the balanced mixes that have the goat
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetness and the cushy stankiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this, when you light it up,
everybody goes, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like cushy stank at first and
then you puff on it and when you exhale,
[SPEAKER_00]: this sweetness just comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I would narrow down the
morphology of Arise to around three common
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes and three less common
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I said there are six phenotypes
but it is an F1 hybrid so variation is to
[SPEAKER_00]: be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I like variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that variation is a way to
customize and custom tailor our gardens to
[SPEAKER_00]: our needs while still growing the strain
that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variation is to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind when you're growing from
seed, especially with an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got three common and three less
common phenotypes and I have identified
[SPEAKER_00]: them as the sativa heavy, the indica
heavy, the goat phenotype, the daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, the 50-50 and the one that I
call the stretcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't call it the stretcher because
it's gonna put you on a stretcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the stretcher because it grows
like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking tall and skinny and out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about the six
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna see a little bit of
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be fucking that's exactly
this one but they're gonna fall into this
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will catch onto this as we do
more phenohunts and as we do more strain
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sativa heavy phenotype of Arise is
a little airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like beach sand and juicy fruit
gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a tropical aroma to it and it
smells like saltwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like you're sitting on the beach
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly has a tropical smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly brings out that island sweet
skunk and that Hawaiian sativa flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype that I've labeled as the
sativa dominant phenotype or the sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy phenotype will get really tall and
there's a lot of space between the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a lot of spacing in your
nodes, you're gonna get that sativa heavy,
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, super sativa, high THC plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there will be a lot of stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna get really tall and it's gonna
take 10 weeks but it will test very high
[SPEAKER_00]: in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the sativa heavy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tall and skinny and it takes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's confused as a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a boy but also it could be that
crazy sativa heavy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one we'll talk about is the
indica heavy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indica heavy smells like kush and feet
with a little bit of that golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mostly Joseph OG and it's got a
little bit of that Kim D in there and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: stinky like feet and funk and armpits and
it's got a little bit of like a fresh tire
[SPEAKER_00]: shop, that rubber, smell at the tire shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of that going on to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna have tighter node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be kind of stretchy from the
Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the node spacing will be close together
but then the branches that come off will
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of long and the bud sets from up
that branch will be kind of far apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna grow more golf ball type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna have very Joseph OG dominant
traits is the indica heavy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see just a bunch of golf balls
popping up a stick, you're gonna have that
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph OG, that foot, kush, earth sort of
smelling phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my favorite but it is a good
phenotype if you're going for that indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one takes about 56 to 63 days for the
indica phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go to about 60 days if you're
getting eager and you think it's done at
[SPEAKER_00]: 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an indica plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it ripen up a little extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be super stony for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, number three is the golden goat
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one looks and smells very similar to
golden goat so let's talk about the way
[SPEAKER_00]: this one grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat phenotype obviously looks
and smells a lot like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stay a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stay squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main top will not get way above the
rest of the plant like some strains like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat phenotype likes to stay
kind of even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have a dominant top but it will
stay a little bit shorter and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: trait from the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes with the golden goat phenotype,
you will see spiraled growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of times when you're growing a
plant, the main stock comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get two nodes that come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call that east and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get two east and west growing nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then two north and south growing nodes
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a plus sign basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant with, it's symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got two coming out this way,
two coming out this way and then it will
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat that process and you'll have north
and south, east and west, north and south,
[SPEAKER_00]: east and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat carries a trait that will make
plants produce sets of six branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of every 90 degrees you have a
branch, it will be every 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be one branch and then 60
degrees and another branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right before you would have that north
and south, east and west, it would go a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit shorter and it would make room
for another set of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have triple the branching off of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it spiraled growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice it if it's doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat phenotype smells very
sweet like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got very short, tight node spacing
and it takes about 56 to 63 days for that
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype to finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the visual differences between the
golden goat and the daybreaker are the
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker phenotypes are a little tighter
and rockier and the golden goat kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: has more of a jagged edge to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little pointier and it comes out a
little fluffier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to tell the difference
between the golden goat and the daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the daybreaker
phenotype specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker phenotype looks and smells
obviously like daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets tall, but she stacks up with huge
colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that tall space is going to turn into
a giant bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: She stretches a little bit in early flower
because of the OG dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gas is more prevalent in the
daybreaker phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for the gas,
you want the daybreaker leaning phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got tight node spacing,
but the branches do stretch in early
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and that is from the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a pretty good description
of the indica heavy, the sativa heavy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat and the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have golden goat flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have tropical flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have airy fluffier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have sativa dominant
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have these tight golf
ball little rocky buds that smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel and cush or you're going to get
really obviously sativa tropical plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get really obviously
indica dominant cushy plants or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you get the one I call the 50-50
mix, the Arise that everybody's looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mix that grows like Chem D and
the goat mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that tall Chem D stout
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the branchiness and the
strength of the golden goat, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like Joseph OG with the hint of
tropical sweetness at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the 50-50 mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all of the parents in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Hawaiian sativa and there
you can smell that Hawaiian sativa and the
[SPEAKER_00]: island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 50-50 is obviously my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the phenotype I keep around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the phenotype that tests in the 30%
bracket consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenotype gives me a ripping head
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make you forget what's going on,
but it also will make your whole body
[SPEAKER_00]: relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will sit down on the couch to watch an
episode of Rick and Morty or Bob's Burgers
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will press play on the DVR and you
will sit in that seat, but you will not
[SPEAKER_00]: remember watching the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of high that Arise gives
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember on Friday when Craig was talking
to the dog statue and he was brushing his
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt off and brushing his pants off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of high that Arise gives
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really balanced high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the body stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tests high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows great and I just love the high
that it gives me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers just make me, I feel it in my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it in my eyes and the dabs are just
super intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly recreational when I'm smoking
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes straight to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to play music and it
makes me want to talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep talking about this specific
phenotype, the 50-50 phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenotype puts out huge harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can top it or you cannot top it and it
will grow like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll recognize this phenotype when it's
growing because it will have a long chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: bud and it'll look like it's got that chem
D structure but then the leaves will get
[SPEAKER_00]: long and skinny and they will kind of taco
up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're big and fat leaves,
it's probably not the 50-50 phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little bit skinnier and really
pointy and then they kind of taco and
[SPEAKER_00]: point up just a little tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the phenotype that I really like
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really like to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that tests high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that organica tested high
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we tested high with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that makes all the good
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the one that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the 50-50 phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one to go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you see me posting pictures
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about number six,
the one I call the stretcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you would hope I call it the
stretcher because it makes you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call an ambulance, but that's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenotype is super easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taller than every plant in the
fucking grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is what I call the
non-desirable phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: She stays skinny and produces long,
skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really long, really skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the Hawaiian sativa doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds that come from this phenotype are
coated in trichomes and the high is
[SPEAKER_00]: straight to your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your eyes bright red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your eyes squinty and you won't
be able to find your keys while they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll lose your sunglasses while you're
wearing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with the stretcher is that
she will triple in size in the first three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four weeks of flower and she takes like
10 full weeks, maybe 11 or 12 full weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower depending on the phenotype that
you find out of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got high ceilings and a lot of
time to experiment, it's got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, but I would rather just cut her
down and grow some of the other phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a phenotype in there that you
might want to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sativa high that comes from that
thing, the amount of trichomes that fall
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it are amazing and impressive,
but it's such a pain in the ass to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not even worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one I call the stretcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets super tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays super skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically grows one long skinny switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the one to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got that one popping up,
maybe get rid of her early, but don't
[SPEAKER_00]: confuse it for the sativa dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a lot of branching,
that's the sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see branching, that's the
girl I call the stretcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and cut her down, get her out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are basically the six phenotypes
to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should expect variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I release the F3s, or F4s,
which I will announce and label the
[SPEAKER_00]: packages accordingly, expect the variation
from the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate variation and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the fun from growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're going to grow Arise,
I would suggest you grow 63 to 70 days for
[SPEAKER_00]: each phenotype if it's your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 77 days and you think it may
need it, give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: 63 to 70 days, maybe 77 if needed,
and see what they do and adjust from there
[SPEAKER_00]: the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that a phenohunt is the start
of dialing in a long-term relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with a selected phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just trying to get this one
dialed in the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to date her a couple
of times before you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are going to give
you generous yields, and the potency on
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is always impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any phenotype you pull out will be
covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be highly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be very desirable medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is very fast to veg, and she loves
lots of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give her as much light as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise also grows quickly in flower,
and you will need some sort of supports in
[SPEAKER_00]: early flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to get tall and heavy on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are going to get fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes to produce big buds,
so be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some sticks or trellising or tomato
cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to crack and pop the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the plant with your fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the plant with the other fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when you did the thing in
baseball?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd go up the bat and see who gets the
bat first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys all did that,
but you put one hand above the other and
[SPEAKER_00]: just twist them opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stem is going to go, just going to
make a little pop noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to crush and destroy the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are breaking the cellulose in the
plant, and it's going to get stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to slow down the
stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to twist them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always helps me slow down the
stretch, and it also makes the stalk
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger to support the upcoming bud sets,
because Arise is going to have some beefy
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a head start on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise also has a very nice array of
flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need carbon filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the sweet, like golden goat candy
smelling phenotypes will get attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be like, what is that
smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this candy and ice cream
smell going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your neighbors are going to notice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to want to know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody got raided here in our area
recently because the neighbors reported
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the police went there, knocked on the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy gave shitty answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police came back and took everything
because he had too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that aroma is what got him in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys take care of your aromas if
you're growing legally or illegally,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's legal here, and they still
call the police on him for the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon filters are a must.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise can handle heavy feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can handle snapping and popping,
and she takes stress training well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can also handle problems pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a technical issue in a grow where
an air conditioner went out, and Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: just kept growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else was pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had another room where the auto water
did not turn off one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant got way too much water because
the auto the shutoff switch didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they got too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Arise plant loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else wanted to fucking die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arise can take a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have beat the shit out of her in
several different environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she seems to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does well in high heat and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice they have huge fanlies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a trait from Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those traits, those leaves will hang down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to remove the excess
leaves that are really big to allow light
[SPEAKER_00]: and air to get to your plants and your
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those larger leaf phenotypes will look
droopy sometimes for no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, that's a trait from
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it in several crosses that I've
made from the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are just so big that they droop
a little bit all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can't hold those big ass leaves
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not having problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes huge leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those phenotypes are very OG dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones with the big leaves that hang
down a lot usually produced that cushy
[SPEAKER_00]: chemi aroma that I was enjoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should warn you about Arise is
to not let it become a root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots grow as quickly as the plant
above the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is growing just as fast inside that
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: A root bound plant will trick you into
thinking it has other issues like pH or
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your container size and
plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant's going to take eight to 10
weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have the proper pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you flower on time so you don't
overload your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'd recommend using an air pot so
that if the plant does get too big,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll kind of feel that air out there and
it'll kind of prune itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My best results personally with Arise have
come from air pots with cocoa using
[SPEAKER_00]: VegBloom nutrients and a few additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those additives were from New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd recommend Shine at the last week of
veg and into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're leaving veg, add the Shine at
that point in time, the last week of veg
[SPEAKER_00]: and starting flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put Shine in there and that will help
reduce the stretch at early flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will slow down that Arise stretch
because they do like to take off on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about smoking
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a long time about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about smoking on some Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have reported that Arise is
the perfect nighttime medicine to relax
[SPEAKER_00]: them at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people report that Arise is the
perfect high energy daytime smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the funny thing is both of those
reports came from the same batch of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were buying the same product and
people were having completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it's such a balanced
phenotype that it's just working for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have different body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Arise as my recreational smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a really good head high and it
makes me social and creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me like to play music and
honestly, it makes me just forget about
[SPEAKER_00]: any stress or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just puts all that shit to the
back of my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of just like stress reliever
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to smoke Arise when I play music
or when I'm writing podcast episodes or
[SPEAKER_00]: when I have to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not in the mood to be social and
you got to go talk to damn people and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not feeling it, smoke some Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get there and you just won't shut
the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, hey, I'm here guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Arise does to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical patients have reported that Arise
helps with their headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have said it helps with
depression and PTSD symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it helps with migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it will help with appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not eating, you can smoke some
Arise and it will make you hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indica part of Arise will work if
you've got pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll chill out all of your body pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some aches and pains,
I think Arise would be great for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could also see it working as sort of an
antidepressant because it's got such an
[SPEAKER_00]: uplifting positive high, which is kind of
why I called it Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to wake up part of my
brain that just doesn't seem to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lazy part that you're like,
it just puts another vibration in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes your brain Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I called it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you'll notice a lot of the things
that I bred from Daybreaker have a one
[SPEAKER_00]: word name like cascade and Arise and
firefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of trying to honor Gage Green
Genetics since that Daybreaker came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to use one word inspirational
type words to name their strains and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep with that vibe and I
thought Arise was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cascade, firefly, things like that that
came from the Daybreaker will have those
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the naming scheme comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of just trying to do some honor to
Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the name Arise actually may have been
mentioned by somebody on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to name something else and
they said, how about Arise?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's not the name for
this cross, but that is certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: something for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when this one came up,
I was like, that's where this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes those strain names just get
written down and they get saved for the
[SPEAKER_00]: right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happened here with this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my strain
report on Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you for listening to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in Arise seeds,
I recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode comes out just in time for
the 4th of July sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sale goes from July 3rd to July 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use coupon code IRE20, you will get
20% off your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check them out at
dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're growing Arise,
if you have grown Arise, if you do grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise, I would love to see your photos and
your lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to send them to me on
Instagram, which is probably the easiest
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, my Instagram is IRE underscore
genetics, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me there, send me your pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tag me, share them with me, however you
want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to email them to me,
my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see what you're doing with
Arise or any of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a great job, maybe I'll
send you more seeds to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that was my report on
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one more thing I want to ask
of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get Arise on Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly is a website that recommends
strains and highlights strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that need information on
shopping at a dispensary will go to Leafly
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to find a strain that works for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get Arise on Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way we can do that is to create
an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little tab that says add a
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to leave a strain review.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have ever grown, smoked,
consumed, smelled, or seen Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're qualified to go leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go talk about Arise on Leafly and
eventually they will add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We currently have Lemon Jeffrey on Leafly
and Mike Capelton is on Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see my Arise featured on
Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make me proud.

that, I would appreciate that support.
