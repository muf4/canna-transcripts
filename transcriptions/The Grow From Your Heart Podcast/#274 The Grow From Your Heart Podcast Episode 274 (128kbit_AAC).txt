[SPEAKER_00]: happy new year cannabis community it's
time for episode number 274 of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast your source for
cannabis news education and conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right if you're a new grower if
you're a professional grower if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: new smoker or a dedicated dabber if you're
a cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you I'm your host my friends call me
Rasta Jeff I want to thank you guys again
[SPEAKER_00]: for joining me as always I need to send a
huge thank you shout out to my friends in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mystic roots band for what they use
their music on my podcast big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: cat coup and the entire mystic group crew
once again happy new year everybody thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: again for joining me this will be the
first episode I put out in 2018 I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody had a great 2017 I hope your
holiday season was perfect and I hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: had a safe happy new year also I hope 2018
brings you everything you were hoping for
[SPEAKER_00]: all right you guys I usually like to start
off the podcast by talking about what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been smoking on and today I've got some
shit worth talking about I have been
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing on some lemon Jeffrey sauce and it
is tremendous let's talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about this I'm grabbing the package to
tell you about it I have got some lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey sauce grown by our friends at
elevations in Colorado Springs extracted
[SPEAKER_00]: by our friends at manna extracts a friend
of mine on Instagram actually contacted me
[SPEAKER_00]: and said hey dude you need to have some of
this so he made sure that he got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: grams in my hands I don't know if he wants
to be mentioned on the show or not he
[SPEAKER_00]: knows who he is super huge shout out bro I
appreciate it also huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: elevations and manna extracts they did a
hell of a good job with this lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce let's open up the jar and look at it
for a second here the only problem is
[SPEAKER_00]: these jars kind of suck these jars get
stuck these childproof lids these suck
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the only thing I would complain about
upgrade these fucking jar lids but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got it open let's look at it the
consistency is kind of like a moist cake
[SPEAKER_00]: batter or maybe a moist cheesecake batter
the color is beautiful it is beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: gold and yellow it is perfect it's what
you would think lemon candy would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: color of and this jar is eight to ten
inches away from my face you guys and all
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell is lemon candy it just smells
like lemon heads or lemon meringue or some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of really soft lemon scented candy
and I really enjoy it and I said soft yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's weird I think some things
have like lemon pledge has a hard lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: smell lemon pledge that smell punches you
in the face and is pungent I think lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey has a soft lemon smell it's got
like a I don't know it's not real abrasive
[SPEAKER_00]: it coats your tongue and it's pleasing it
makes you go ooh that's soft and yummy
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'm crazy but I think it's a soft
lemon scent and I really enjoy it so shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to everybody involved in there this
hash is amazing I've talked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency I talked about the color I
talked about the smell the taste is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing it tastes like you just put uh not
the not the lemon head candy itself
[SPEAKER_00]: because those are a little stronger than
what this tastes like but the smell of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon candy it's like you took a bite out
of that like how the lemon head box smells
[SPEAKER_00]: when you smell it it smells like you
dabbed that flavor and it is delicious the
[SPEAKER_00]: high obviously is tremendous it's very
sativa dominant and I think it's got me
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling a little bit so this should be a
fun podcast once again shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody involved in this delicious lemon
Jeffrey sauce of course the lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: is the lemon skunk pollinated by a
reversed golden goat of course I made that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain several years ago it's making its
way through Colorado again and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: very popular a lot of people have been
asking for more seeds of the lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that in 2018 that will be one
of my goals I think I'm going to make no
[SPEAKER_00]: not I think I am I am going to make more
lemon Jeffrey seeds in 2018 so everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been asking there's the official
announcement I talked about it on an
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram live video the other day but
this is the official announcement I will
[SPEAKER_00]: be making more lemon Jeffrey feminized
seeds in 2018 it may not be till the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer because I've got other things lined
up and I've got schedules and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that to go with but there will be more
lemon Jeffrey seeds in the future and
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking of seeds in the future let's talk
about my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project I like to keep you guys updated on
a breeding ready but I can see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination went well I can see that the
seeds are developing I can see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are healthy and I can see that this
is going to be a successful pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: chucking run so here in about 30 days from
now I will have new stuff that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tested I will have replenishings of old
stuff so that the hella dank seed bank can
[SPEAKER_00]: get some restocks they'll also get some of
the new stuff so stay tuned new stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming you guys I am really excited about
this star dog cross to a rise and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really excited about Durbin poison cross
to a rise I think that those are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have great potential those are two of my
favorite strains so crossing them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: arise has me really excited and I kind of
can't wait so I'll keep you guys updated
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably talk about it on every
episode from now until the time they come
[SPEAKER_00]: down and then I'll start talking about
them again when I grow them because I
[SPEAKER_00]: really can't wait so get used to hearing
about those two crosses because I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about them a lot I'm also super excited
about the platinum tangy cross to arise
[SPEAKER_00]: just something about that that orange
smell when I walk in the garden I can
[SPEAKER_00]: smell that platinum tangy over everything
else it's the platinum tangy and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cactus cooler the aromas of those things
just overpower everything also there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: Leroy in there that's gonna get pollinated
and I'm making a strain for a friend and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Leroy to arise will be called the
Cletus and that's being made for a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't have any plants to release the
seeds of the Cletus it's not gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere it'll be in my garden it'll be in
my friend Cletus's garden it may be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple other small gardens but I'm really
I'm not gonna make a lot of seeds I expect
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 20 to 50 seeds out of the small
plant that I made but the Cletus will be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming and it's something I'm excited
about because it's a breeding project for
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend who moved away he's not around
here anymore we don't get to hang out but
[SPEAKER_00]: we still talk I think it'll be fun to grow
the Cletus for my friend Cletus shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: Cletus I hope you hear this brother oh and
since we're talking about naming strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and new cannabis strains the Zac Hayes
cross to arise has an official name it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now officially called pure love the reason
it's called pure love is because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to come up with the name of it I
was sitting there thinking about my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Zac for if you don't know Zac Hayes is a
cross that was made for my friend Zac from
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico who passed away from cystic
fibrosis his real name was Zac Hayes some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends of ours made a strain for him
called Zac Hayes I was gifted a Zac Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: clone I did what I'm supposed to do and I
pollinated that Zac Hayes clone with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise I then took those seeds and I gave
them back to our friends at Organtica they
[SPEAKER_00]: got almost half of all the seeds of the
Zac Hayes to arise I produced I was
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting there thinking of a name for it I
was looking at Zac's Facebook page because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still up I was looking at Zac's
Instagram I was trying to find a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: name this strain and honor Zac and I was
like when I'm trying to name a strain I
[SPEAKER_00]: think why did you do this and in my head I
said I did it out of pure love and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: well fuck that's the name of the strain
pure love Zac Hayes to arise is called
[SPEAKER_00]: pure love I do not know if I will release
the pure love strain in seed form to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public because it has not been tested yet
Organtica has got the first batch of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: they get to grow at first they're gonna
test it for me if they like it if it shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are no herms that there are no
problems that it's a quality strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: it puts out good THC that it's worth
growing and it's worth sharing with people
[SPEAKER_00]: I will consider putting it out as a public
release for other people to grow but until
[SPEAKER_00]: Organtica finds their clone until
Organtica gets done with it it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere myself and Organtica are gonna
keep it private because that was something
[SPEAKER_00]: made for a friend and then it was made
even further for a friend it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal project we're gonna keep it close
until it's until we've had our run with it
[SPEAKER_00]: but pure love Zac Hayes to arise big shout
out to my buddy Zac miss you and I love
[SPEAKER_00]: you every day bro also big shout out to
all of our friends at Organtica you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing a great job down there if you
guys keep killing it and crushing it like
[SPEAKER_00]: you are I'm gonna have to come down there
and pay you a visit and come check out the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and come high five everybody and
shake your hands bring you some more seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: all right big shout out to everybody down
at Organtica big shout out to Tim huge
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Zac and I even want to send a
shout out to Dee's Romero even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: were too high to get out of the car and
had to take a nap the last time you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: drove to my house big shout out bro I look
forward to seeing you next time I look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to taking some big old globs with
you can't wait all right let's move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with the podcast a little bit it
is the first of the year so I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a good idea to talk about some
attainable garden goals and ways that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can improve your garden in 2018 if you're
not thinking of ways to improve you were
[SPEAKER_00]: standing still and moving backwards so
let's talk about ways that we can improve
[SPEAKER_00]: our garden in 2018 and realistic goals
that you can set for yourself that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would actually be able to reach for your
garden in 2018 a lot of people may say hey
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow better I want to do
something better next year with my garden
[SPEAKER_00]: with my life with myself but they don't
know what they want to do so I've thought
[SPEAKER_00]: of some goals that you can actually reach
some goals that are attainable these are
[SPEAKER_00]: goals that any grower can reach for
because if you're an excellent grower if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a mediocre grower if you're a
shitty grower if you're an old-school
[SPEAKER_00]: grower if you're a pro grower there's
always room for improvement and the things
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna mention everybody can improve on
a little bit so let's talk about goals you
[SPEAKER_00]: can reach to improve your garden in 2018
the first thing you can do and it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds redundant because I've already said
this the first thing you can do is set
[SPEAKER_00]: some goals get out some paper get out a
dry erase board get out your phone open up
[SPEAKER_00]: a notepad and actually write something
down it will actually be a goal for 2018
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't write it down if you just say
in 2018 I want to do this sure you said it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's out there there were no witnesses
there's nothing holding you to it there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to remind you of that every day if
you've got a piece of paper sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: your desk if you've got a note on the
refrigerator if you've got a note in your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone and you see it occasionally and it
says in 2018 I'm going to improve this
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a reminder there's some
accountability there you see it and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: stop doing it you kind of feel shitty for
yourself and bad about yourself because
[SPEAKER_00]: you have failed yourself so write it down
put it on paper just say hey I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this even if it's just a little thing
and a small improvement a small goal write
[SPEAKER_00]: it down and accomplish it we talked I
think I talked about this on the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode if you write down a goal you'll
accomplish it and then when you accomplish
[SPEAKER_00]: that goal you'll say shit I got to write
down another goal and then you'll write
[SPEAKER_00]: down two goals and then you'll accomplish
both of those and you'll go shit I can do
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things and your goals will get
bigger your life will get better and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll start improving in so many
different ways you'll gain more confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get a better personality you'll get
a better life things will just start
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together so write down a goal
that's all you have to do one goal
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish that one goal that'll turn into
two goals that'll turn into you just
[SPEAKER_00]: crushing fucking life so write down a goal
this podcast is about cannabis so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna write down a cannabis related goal
here's something I think we should all be
[SPEAKER_00]: striving for we all want better yields
right you want to pull more weight you
[SPEAKER_00]: want more grams per watt whatever grow
room you've been growing in however much
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been pulling consistently let's
strive for a little bit more let's strive
[SPEAKER_00]: for a better yield in 2018 that's an
attainable goal the only way to reach that
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is to find ways to improve your
garden now what are a few ways that you
can grow a little bit more clinics growing
well now that the weather has just gotten
a little bit better as well so the first
way to do that is with your plants your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing your garden so I've talked about
scragg is really easy I've done a full
[SPEAKER_00]: episode on Scragg&g scragg&g is when you
put a net up above the canopy and you bend
[SPEAKER_00]: all the plants down into that net so they
can't grow too high but they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: out now now you were filling your
horizontal space instead of the vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: space you're not growing up into the
lights but you're spreading the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using up all the space so scragg&g
and they're getting big, walk over and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me kind of explain this a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start about two inches above where the
pot or the stem comes out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got some dirt with a little stick
sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put my finger there and grab the
base of that stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I reach up about an inch above that
and I just twist my fingers opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: directions and it sounds like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds just like you popped your
knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant goes pop and you're just
breaking the cellulose right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I move up about four inches and do it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And move up four inches and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I repeat this on all of the
larger branches of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to see knuckles form on all
the spots where you've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now allowing more nutrient to pass
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now making that stock thicker and
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making bigger, more robust,
more active, more productive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give them a little, just a little
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just twist it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it on a couple branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if it's your first try, don't do it
at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go to the top of the plant and give
it a twist and see what happens when you
[SPEAKER_00]: give it just a little turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear a crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bend it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give a little pop and a little bit of
a twist right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help that plant become
stronger, healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to work out a little stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and also the popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start when the plants get kind of big
and veg and I will do that all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: to like week three, four, maybe week five
of some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how robust they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But week four into flower is not odd to
see me walk up and just pop a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll watch it recover within a day
and start growing even faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pop and twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and remove leaves that are
not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves that are in the way of light
getting into your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take those leaves out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to grow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to grow buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaves that are too big, go ahead and
take them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not sure how much defoliating
you want to do and you're kind of new at
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you're a little bit afraid,
the first day of flowering, go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and take off any leaf that's got a purple
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a big leaf with a purple stem,
just take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are healthy, that purple
stem will probably just snap right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need scissors or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grab it and pop it right off of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're afraid to take too
much off, just go lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always go harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on week one, I like to strip the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: On week two, I like to go in and kind of
bottom them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take out that shit on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way to improve your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off all the shit on the bottom so
you'll have big branches that come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't come up high enough to where
you think they're going to make bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the light, get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got branches that do come up to
the light, but there's a bunch of bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom, like little tiny sucker
branches coming off, you can clean those
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not rare for me to have, if I've got
a four foot tall plant, I'll clean up the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole foot off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be just a stalk for the whole
12 inches of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: No branches coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those first branches that come off,
it would not be rare for them to have two
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of nothing and nothing, no bud for
the last foot to 10 inches, maybe eight
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cleaned it all off because all that
bottom shit's not going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting any energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be crappy stuff that
you don't want to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you clean it off the bottom,
you can move that energy up to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and get the energy up to the top
where the shit's easier to trim and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get more production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week one, do some stripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two, get in there and lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three, do more stripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take more leaves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out a little bit so the light
can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on week four, do your final
bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and clean out the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off all those little sucker branches,
all those little shitty popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's leaf, bottom, leaf, final bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can keep defoliating through
the flower cycle if you wish to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go too hard on defoliating,
you can kind of slow down the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll slow down bud production if you go
too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have to find a happy medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, week one, strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two, lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three, strip a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then week four, go clean up the bottoms
for the final part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really help you increase your
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so everybody wants bigger
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing everybody wants to do and a
goal that you can set for yourself and a
[SPEAKER_00]: goal that would definitely be attainable
if you work at it is increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency of your finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how can we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Potency is kind of limited by genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got genetics that do not put out
high THC, then you may not be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase that THC much more than what it
already is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be reaching its potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got some plants that you
know can get better, if one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends has the same clone or if you've
grown it better before, there are a few
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you can do to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant has the potential of getting
32% THC and you're only getting 28,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few things you can do are dial in the
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants like consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants like reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your plant likes it a little hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your plant likes it a little cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to dial in the temps
and the humidity and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis is like having a
girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to figure out how to cater to
that plant to keep it happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have three girlfriends because
you can't keep all three of them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to want to eat at the
spaghetti factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to want to eat at the
cheesecake factory and one's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking have any idea what she wants and
she's going to leave it up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are the same fucking way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to have multiple cannabis plants
in the same room and dial them all in
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to improve your potency,
select a strain and work with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what temperature it likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what humidity it likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell by looking most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to run a strain
several times to dial it in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get your temps dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your humidity dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your feed dialed in for that specific
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that plant want more nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that plant want less nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people forget that some of the
cushions and OG plants, they want a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: People forget that some of the plants may
want a little more amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay attention to stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for better potency, dial in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start paying attention to temps and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your pH on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your feeds on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could tell you that the plant
wants this temperature and this humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and this much feed, but when you're trying
to improve at this level, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, ideally somewhere between like 75 and
78 degrees would be really nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe your plant is from another
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your plant is a specific phenotype
that wants it really hot and likes it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe it likes it really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to dial in your
plant, which is going to take attention
[SPEAKER_00]: and a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to build a
relationship with this plant so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what it likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be in there every day looking
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes, write shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get this plant perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a very large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got approximately 40 different
strains in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got notes on a board for all the
grow staff just to remind them,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, the blueberry cookies does not like
being overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not overwater blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one that gets really
pissed off if you defoliate it too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one that we have to not
pack them too close together because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do shit together when you press them
too close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's learning each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's learning your plant and dialing it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to increase your potency,
you're going to have to learn that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get your room
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get everything
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to grow that plant a
couple of cycles and figure out what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does and does not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reachable goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better potency is an attainable goal for
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of you don't live in legal
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you that are growing may live
somewhere you don't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not be a goal that you can
verify, but you'll be able to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to see the extra work you
put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell the extra details
that you worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to see it in the finished
product, and I bet you won't even need a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab to show that you are getting better
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we covered the two obvious
things that people want to improve and
[SPEAKER_00]: goals that people can set, which are
better yields and better potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something people don't think about is
better scheduling and planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work on scheduling our gardens and
harvests a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many harvests do you want to pull in
2018?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you pull six harvests in 2018 out of
your grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you pull five harvests out of your
grow room in 2018?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got multiple lights and
you're running a perpetual grow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to try and pull 52 harvests
out of a grow room this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some schedules going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should know how long it takes for your
plants to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are running nine-week plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got nine-week plants,
you need to have veg plants ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace them when they harvest at the end
of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to decide how long you're
going to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to decide how long it takes you
to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us can get clones rooted in about
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a nine-week cycle,
you need to allow yourself two weeks to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut clones, then however many weeks of veg
you want, probably about four weeks of veg
[SPEAKER_00]: for most of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if you're running a nine-week
flower cycle, at week three of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to cut new clones so that they
can root in 14 days and they can veg for
[SPEAKER_00]: four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as you cut down that
flower room, you can move those veg plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and not have any downtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure of your schedule,
but that's a good example of what you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to start doing if you want to make the
best of your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very easy and attainable goal is to set
more scheduling for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part about that is staying on
top of the schedule once you set it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about at the start of the
show, I want to make more lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it until the summer because I
have scheduled my rooms out for at least
[SPEAKER_00]: the next six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds like a long time,
but if you think about it, that's only
[SPEAKER_00]: three crops in a certain, in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're flowering in one room,
six months, three crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually 2.75 crops because there's
a few extra days there at the end because
[SPEAKER_00]: we do the nine-week cycles and not four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be like 2.75 crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is that I've got it
scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to do my best to stay
on that schedule and not mess myself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do it right, I know how many cycles
I'll be able to get this year out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good estimation of how many seeds
I'll be able to produce out of that room
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just helps you plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you stay on top of things and it
helps you set goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set some goals, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we've set goals to get better
yields, better potency and better
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about random things that
you guys may be able to set a goal to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better at in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something a lot of us could get better at
in our grow is cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is your clone tech?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are 70% of your clones living?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are 80% of your clones living?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of your clones live now?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to cut 100 clones,
how many do you think would be surviving
[SPEAKER_00]: and usable in about 15 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I said, hey dude, let's cut 100 clones
together right now, you and me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll be back in 14 days, how many of
them would you be proud to show me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many of them would you be
embarrassed to show me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you said 50 of them would have died,
let's increase your clone success rate to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said 70%, let's get you up to 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the 80 or 90%, let's get you
100% success in your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see everybody have 100%
success with their clones, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand there's some learning to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not all spending all day in a
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not all spending all of our time
learning about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a goal that is attainable is
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're at 50%, let's get you to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at 70, let's get you to 85 or
90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just improve your clone technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can get better at cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe leave the clones alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people fuck with clones too
much, and that's where they ruin them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get you better at your clone
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing that people can
definitely improve on at the totally
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite end of the grow from cloning is
the drying and curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people grow amazing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow it, they take great pictures,
they cut it down, they trim it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking champ, they take more pictures,
and then they ruin it by not drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have put out a couple of episodes about
drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your questions about drying
and curing if you email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the crops that you're going to
produce this year in 2018 that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: got scheduled and planned for your goals,
you're going to have to learn to dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: cure them better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make that one of your goals for
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're already an amazing grower,
if you're a pro grower, if you know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: cure weed, you can do it better,
especially if you're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work on learning to dry and cure
a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a goal that you can achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we say just a little better,
you just have to do better than last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grow five or six crops,
you're going to get five or six good
[SPEAKER_00]: chances at getting better this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drying and curing is something we can
all work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need more guidance on that,
email me to growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk you through drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will write out an SOP and we will get
your cannabis dried properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and one more thing that you can
work on in 2018 that you can improve on,
[SPEAKER_00]: a goal that you can set would be to become
more cost efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a new grower, if you're a pro
grower, if you're an expert, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a closet, if you're running a
large commercial facility, there are ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can become more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting electricity somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting nutrients somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting product somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting time somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at our process in the garden
and streamline the time that we spend in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and streamline the money that we
spend in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're wasting water somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're wasting electricity somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a fan and air conditioner and
a blower on at the same time that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you only need two of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for profit, if you're
growing for medicine, every penny counts
[SPEAKER_00]: either way because somebody's got to pay
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're drawing electricity,
if you're wasting water, it's just going
[SPEAKER_00]: down the drain basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who can afford to put anything down
the drain these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also think about the environmental
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wasting electricity and wasting
water, you're destroying the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running out of resources and wasting
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to become more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, try to become more
environmentally conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that all of us can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all buying bottled nutrients that
have to be shipped across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We throw the plastic bottles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to be more environmentally
conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be more responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an easy goal that we can all set
and try to reach in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I have inspired you guys to set
some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've inspired you guys to improve
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a notebook and a pen or
maybe something in your phone and took a
[SPEAKER_00]: note and actually wrote some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take a minute and think about some
goals for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about some goals for your life
in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your garden shouldn't be the only thing
you're worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Challenge yourself, set some goals for
yourself, write it down, set some
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations, reach those goals,
move your life forward, get yourself out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the hole you're stuck in, make your own
life better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
