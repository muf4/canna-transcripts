[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, yo, this is Coot Dogg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Catherine from Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're listening to Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big up, Rustam and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 266 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a big fat dab of some super
delicious choco-loaf live butter that was
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted by our friends at CRX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up over at Levity Wellness
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my head doing nice things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way this batter feels in my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I talk about love and shatter,
but when you smoke the batter,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of expands in your lungs and you
don't have to smoke as much and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it makes me real talkative,
real clear for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for jumping in, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to talk about in this
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about my breeding project I
keep telling you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past few weeks, I've been updating
you about a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just about completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when I finish this podcast,
the lights will have come on and I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to go in the room and I'll see how
much longer we've got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pulling a random seed out every
couple of days to look and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are getting nice and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them weren't where I wanted
them yet, so maybe, maybe they're ready
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some new stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed, of course, everything was
crossed to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a golden goat female that was
pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is Chem D crossed to Joseph O
.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes real O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy, real chem funky feet kind of smell
and traits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he put the golden goat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it kind of sweet, made it kind of
tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it grow bigger and faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a male of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that in the grow room with a whole
bunch of sexy ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Strawberry Fields in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have Strawberry Fields crossed to
Arise until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made a small tester batch to check
out for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grow those, see how they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Grateful Dog so we can make more
morning dew seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of Arise females so we
can make more Arise F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Kosher Kush in there that I'm
really excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make some Arise to Kosher
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be my new cross that I'm going to
test out for myself and see where that
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been talking a lot about my
breeding project and I'm excited that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what else should we talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Thursday night, I am proud of my city.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally hosted a very successful
cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a few small cannabis events here
in this town.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do a little smokeout sesh at
the Cloud 9 hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one night the cops came and everyone
got paranoid and nobody showed up after
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a large official smoke event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a smoke event, it was a cannabis
event, but there was no consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm turning down the music slowly so I can
think better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to think with all that music in
the headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cincy night, we had Cincy night here in
Pueblo, Colorado on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at the Union Depot, which is the
old train station is what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big fancy building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was done with class.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not consumption inside the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there were three DAB buses
sponsored by different companies outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were able to go in one of those
buses and take a DAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you brought your own, you could smoke
your own concentrate in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, if you did not bring your own
concentrate, they had a DAB to offer you
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hop on the bus, take a little DAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bus was parked so you weren't going
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The catch is you're not allowed to smoke
in a building like the Union Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be illegal to smoke in there
because that's basically a public place,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those DAB buses are private property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the windows are blacked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They check your ID, make sure you're old
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go up in there, you take a DAB,
then you come out coffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was how people were able to medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're Rasta Jeff,
you've got your own ways of medicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You medicated heavily before you left or
perhaps before you walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, Cincinnati, I think it was a
huge success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very classy event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was set up for those of you that don't
go to any cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do go to cannabis events,
it was just like all the other events
[SPEAKER_00]: except you couldn't smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't go to events, it's basically
like a trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone sets up their little booths all
around the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you walk, you mill around in circles
and they build like a little island in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of other booths that are back to
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just walk around and do the last
laps and check out all the vendors and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the booths and trade business cards and
pick up free samples of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't give out product, but they can
give you samples of like maybe people were
[SPEAKER_00]: giving out a lot of hats and stickers and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the nutrient companies had small
nutrient samples to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stuff like that they were given out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like most any other trade show that
you'd go to for any other industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: except this was cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_00]: For being a Pueblo event, I was actually
quite impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if I even wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The always lovely, always beautiful Miss
Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works for a dispensary and she was she
wasn't required to go, but I mean her
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary asked that she go and she went
and so of course I met up with her and a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of her co-workers and then hung out
with of course everybody from Three
[SPEAKER_00]: Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, White Mike went to an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike hardly ever makes it to these
cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike was there walking around being
social, had a big smile on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he might have been high out of his
mind for a little bit, but Mike was there
[SPEAKER_00]: having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody from Three Rivers was there,
all the management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Miss Kelly for going to
an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was her first industry event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course Christina was there having a
good time and so I was sitting at home
[SPEAKER_00]: debating if I wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making myself some food and I was
like I might eat food and I might go down
[SPEAKER_00]: to that event or I might go take a nap and
then Mike texted me and he's like you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to come down here and then Maddie texted
me and she's like you need to come down
[SPEAKER_00]: here and then Miss Jenny was like hey
where are you and I was like you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I should put on my shoes and I should go
hang out with all my friends at the sensi
[SPEAKER_00]: party and you know what I'm really glad I
did because I ran into a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that I have known for a long time,
people that I haven't seen for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I bumped into a couple of people
that I'd never met before and that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to a guy named
Warren.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Warren right when I walked in and
also Steve Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve I don't know if you listen to the
podcast but it was an honor to finally
[SPEAKER_00]: meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live very close to me and I will make
some free time and I'll get over to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are and we will hang out and medicate
and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've got a lot to teach me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I met a lot of new friends,
people I'd never met before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ran into all the Pueblo people were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from Pueblo and you didn't go,
you should have gone because all the local
[SPEAKER_00]: stoners were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people from the dispensaries,
all the people from all the head shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got along.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into the legendary Matt Fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooper Watts was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linus was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Linus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The always beautiful Maddie was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence from Garden of Weedon was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike from Garden of Weedon was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frosty Organics was there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Jenny Beth was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge party.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of great people were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas from the Spot was there getting
goofy with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Scentsy Night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a huge success.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no consumption in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they were serving alcohol and
around 10, 30 or 11, you could tell that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were serving alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vibe kind of changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started getting, they didn't care
to represent their brand as much as they
[SPEAKER_00]: did around nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have stuck around the event a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Jenny Beth was getting hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was time to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I may have stuck around the event a
little longer to see more people and be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more social if there wasn't so
much alcohol going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see the vibe changing and I did
not want to stick around to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything was gonna go wrong because there
were a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that many businesses,
there could be rivalries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be beefs that nobody even
knows about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes alcohol will light the fire
underneath a beef and some shit could go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't appreciate the alcohol at the
cannabis events, but I get it since it's
[SPEAKER_00]: an event and it's social.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish that we could smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can we drink alcohol?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we voted to regulate cannabis
like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be in the same building.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, overall, Scentsy Night was a huge
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish that we could smoke some dabs
in there while the people are drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear my throat's getting that
thing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be back in just a second and we're
going to read a couple of emails together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back and I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a pretty chunky dab of some
lemon party ambrosia from Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thumbs up to the lemon party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lemon turp in there that I just
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about that is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just realized that in the
background, you guys may hear some street
[SPEAKER_00]: racing going on in my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live a few blocks away from a pretty
large street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, big open street and they are
street racing like a mofo out there
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hear in the background,
I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some software and some equipment
that's trying to cut that out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are loud tonight and I can hear
it in my headphones, which makes me think
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run this show through another program
and I'll try to take all that background
[SPEAKER_00]: noise out, but I don't know how well it
will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into the podcast,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I took a quick dab break,
I mentioned that we were going to read
[SPEAKER_00]: some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a previous episode around Thanksgiving
time, I asked you guys to tell me if you
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed cannabis, if you smoked some
weed, if you took a dab, if you ate some
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, with a family member or somebody
new or somebody that you haven't smoked or
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed with in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to hear about your Thanksgiving
family cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed out one to read on the show
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling it out of the pile of papers
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hi, my name and address.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read this person's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, I'll remain anonymous right at
the top of the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, you asked for your listeners
to share if they smoked with the new
[SPEAKER_00]: relative on Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time ever, I shared a little
bowl with my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, congratulations, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go on to say we had a blast and she
overshared quite a lot about her newfound
[SPEAKER_00]: dating experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought it would happen,
but I'm a little jealous of my mom's sex
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually did take a fat dab and I
gave my mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a quick awkward hug signed no name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, no name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that you, uh, you finally
smoked a bowl with your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of apologize, but I'm kind of
grinning funny at you that you had to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about your mom's newfound dating
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it super awkward that you're
jealous of your mom's sex life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you need to step up your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm glad that you got to,
uh, smoke down with mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't smoked with my mom in quite a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, she used to go to concerts and stuff
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still do shit together, but now she's,
uh, she's got a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does drug testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she just can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also she's clumsy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's just got that kind of luck that
she would smoke a joint with me just to
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrate something silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the next day she would pick up a
cotton ball and it would cut the fuck out
[SPEAKER_00]: of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my mom is clumsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could hurt herself with a bag of
cotton balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how she could do it,
but she can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I haven't smoked with my mom in
ages, but we used to get down a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: long time ago and my mom's kind of a
lightweight and she would take one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, the new weed is too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd take like one or two hits off with a
good weed and she'd just be fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: wrecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But years and years, years, like a hundred
years ago, my mom and I smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the last time we smoked was at a
Tom Petty and it's probably a Tom Petty
[SPEAKER_00]: concert at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anyway, to my, uh, my listener,
dude, I'm glad you got to smoke with your
[SPEAKER_00]: mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that bond strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move into another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got a different tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this one needs much
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is here in the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it a couple of weeks ago and I've
just been devouring episodes whenever I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been learning some great things and
it's been really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite so far was episode 252 on
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: As like most growers do sometimes,
I was nervous about topping my girls too
[SPEAKER_00]: low or too high that same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so far, thanks for the compliment,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to help you out with
episode 252.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you find me helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the email goes on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I think you should consider
revisiting episode 264 with someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: has more organic based growing experience
and have a serious debate about the pros
[SPEAKER_00]: and cons of synthetic versus organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping to gleam some useful info for
comparisons and ways the two can work
[SPEAKER_00]: together, but I couldn't even get through
the episode because it was so biased
[SPEAKER_00]: against organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I started out as a bottle grower
myself, so I definitely know that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have their advantages, but I've been
making the switch to organics because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was starting to feel like a mad scientist
with all the bottles, charts and mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: times, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to simplify a lot of
things, saved money and traded time spent
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing newts for spending time enjoying my
plants and the garden I work so hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little frustrating to hear such a
great resource steer so many growers
[SPEAKER_00]: toward one direction when we need all the
honest, unbiased information we can get in
[SPEAKER_00]: a market where companies are eager to
profit off of people's lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamas Coode, Tad Hussie of the
Cannabis Cultivation and Science Podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Nelson Lindley, who grows a mix of
organic and synthetic are all great
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable resources that I think would
be happy to discuss with you if you
[SPEAKER_00]: reached out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a thought, keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stay black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's a Joey Diaz
reference, so I will stay black,
[SPEAKER_00]: cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's a Joey Diaz reference,
I'm not calling you a cocksucker out of
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a compliment, god damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I hope you're a Joey Diaz fan
because that doesn't make sense if not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get back to the email,
get serious here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're calling me out and saying I
gave a biased opinion on my podcast when I
[SPEAKER_00]: did what I tried to do was a fair debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking this personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it personally, but I'm not
taking it as an attack personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking this as proper guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: My thing was, I am a bottled synthetic
grower, so of course I lean that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do it unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I failed at that, so thank you
for pointing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado and you'd like to
come on the show, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put me in touch with the folks
that you listed at the bottom here or send
[SPEAKER_00]: me a link to get in touch with them,
I would love to get in touch with those
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I can find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, Clackic Miss Coot makes me
nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows so much about cannabis,
he's just gonna come blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to have him on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two folks, I'm not sure who they
are, but I am aware of Clackic Miss Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you said, you only listened
to halfway through the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't hear the end where I said that
organic growers are gonna win because at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the world, we don't have
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the end of the world scenario comes,
whatever that is, I always try to think
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a paranoid hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's gonna go down, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is, but some shit's
gonna go down and one day you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have a grow light and you're not gonna
have a bottled nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that in that case, the organic
farmers are gonna win because they know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to grow everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they know how to grow cannabis
organically indoors, they could do it all
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the sun, they're gonna win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish you would have listened to the
whole episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have helped you out, but I do
agree that maybe I was a little bit biased
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to keep it fair, but obviously I
missed it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for fucking it up and not
getting a fair episode like I should have
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody out there would like to come
and do a friendly debate, I wanna open
[SPEAKER_00]: this up and keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna keep this conversation happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this email just sparked even more
of a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna come on and keep it friendly,
I don't want you to, if you are on Team
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics or on Team Salts or on Team
Organics plus Salts, you can't come on my
[SPEAKER_00]: show and bash the opposite, but you can
come and tell me the pros and cons that
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel are why you do what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanna have a friendly debate,
if you're in the Southern Colorado area,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got gear that I can come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Zoom H6 that fits in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can carry all my shit in my hoodie if I
need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive up to you, I gotta get the car
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I get the car fixed, I can drive
right up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have this debate wherever we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you are, if you're in the
Southern Colorado, maybe Denver area,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have this conversation,
maybe one, two, maybe three other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about organics versus
synthetics altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can make it a fair debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys wanna put me in touch with
these folks that I just mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_00]: email, Clackamas Coot, Tad Hussey,
or Nelson Lindsley, I would not be opposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to you guys putting me in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep this email sitting on the top of
the pile here so I can research those
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, the person that sent me this,
did you put a name on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna call out your name,
your name's on the top of your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should correct that if you don't want
people to know your name because it says
[SPEAKER_00]: your full name up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do appreciate the email and thank
you for the constructive criticism and
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing out that I kinda fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe go back and listen to the second
half just so that you can hear that I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried my best, man, I really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not on either team, I just,
I use one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have much, I have more to say about
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if I tried to tell you about,
I don't know, ask me about my iPhone and
[SPEAKER_00]: ask me about your iPhone, I don't know,
I know the basics of yours, but once you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the apps and shit, I don't know
what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everything that's in my phone,
been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only tell you so much about your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an iPhone, it's got a case on it,
got a glass screen, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like mine does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know so many more details about mine
because I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's why I seem biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any input or
has any complaints about any other
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, I'd love to hear it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just showed that I can take
criticism well and it's gonna make me a
[SPEAKER_00]: better podcaster, a better judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A better teacher, a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to move everybody forward
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are moving me forward by
calling me on the bullshit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grown ass man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like you want me to say
your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward into the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I'm looking to see if they've
got their name on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see their name right there, but nope,
it fucking starts the name like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Anthony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have basically zero experience growing
cannabis, but I want to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been reading tons and listening
exclusively to your grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some seeds from what I assume is
Mexican brickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sativa, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sprouted several seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled off from this stuff and it shoots
up, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard that all these problems stem
from poor light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so he's saying it's just shooting
straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear all these problems stem from poor
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or could it be that it's just the strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: The real question I guess I'm asking is if
the light isn't the problem, could it just
[SPEAKER_00]: be tall ass plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm indoor growing on a low budget
do-it-yourself grow box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote on a post these stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to stop right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that plants want the most is
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe next is either water or
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they need some dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that's not science,
but that's plants need light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one thing that plants
grow off of and then water and air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three things you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without those things, you can't have a
plant, but light keeps that plant alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to feed that plant as much light
as you can give it, or they're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get the light really close to
the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it right on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them some T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set the row of eight T5s right on
top of that seedling to where it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe six or eight inches above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just getting illuminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do it for 18 hours, maybe 24 hours a
day in the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get them started super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're stretching up, if they're
shooting up real tall, that's called
[SPEAKER_00]: getting leggy in the weed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, they need a fan on them if
they're growing that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're growing that fast and you put
some wind on them, you'll at least make
[SPEAKER_00]: them strengthen themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a little stronger,
but you need more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get more light and the plants
need to be closer to more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously the problem just from
what you've described.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any strain you put under that condition
without enough light is going to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to shoot up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things you've said indicate that you need
more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a growing on a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read on a post that these stems can
be planted deeper and will develop roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make them a longer tap root?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make the stem a longer tap root?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about taking this plant
that's too leggy, putting it in a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, digging a deep hole, burying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say your plant has grown eight
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to bury it down to where you've
only got three inches sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is effective, but you can also
overwater and kill the plant doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make a longer tap root
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes the stem buried deeper,
but it's the same idea, but no,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the tap root developed way at the
bottom there and grew out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just burying it deeper,
which works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do that occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I start off my plants in a cup or a
small pot and they overgrow that and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little too big, I'll cut off some of
the bottom branches and bury them a little
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper in a three or seven gallon pot
before I flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more of the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the plant get more oxygen then?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't get more oxygen than you're
burying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get less oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it ruin my plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overwater it, if you bury it too
hard, if you bury it too tight,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't put it in good soil,
if you're rough about it, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can ruin your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are very delicate when they're
that small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can touch it and break it in half when
it's that little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be super, super careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say this is costing me nothing
out of pocket so I can take the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A short segment of leggy seedlings or
whatever you think may help me and others
[SPEAKER_00]: like me would be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so he said a short segment on leggy
seedlings or whatever you think may help
[SPEAKER_00]: some others like me would be super
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I'm glad to help you out,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of do that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's costing you nothing and your
seedlings are that stretchy and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: more from that Mexican brickweed,
I would recommend starting more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause right now you're already
starting off with a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's if you've got free seeds out of that
brickweed, if you have more, start more of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, dude, just start more and then get
more light, put more light closer to your
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why your seedlings are stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in under either like a T five or
underneath like a 250 watt high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium or a 250 watt halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tried to buy that or underneath
a 400 watt halide lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just put it kind of close,
not don't let it burn them, but you want
[SPEAKER_00]: them to get plenty of light and you want
it to be kind of warm and you want to put
[SPEAKER_00]: a light, light fan on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not hard with the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to move the air and as they grow,
then start increasing the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a way to get them a little
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got plenty more,
start more, dude, throw the shitty ones
[SPEAKER_00]: away and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, especially if they're free,
especially if it didn't cost you anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to start with a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just starting off with problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just go back and fix it now and
have a better start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go blow up the old one and build a new
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that is my short segment on
leggy seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the light closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the proper soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to advertise a kind of soil,
but if you're new and you need a cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: light, fluffy soil that you can go out and
just drop some seedlings in, Light Warrior
[SPEAKER_00]: from Fox Farms will work just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, I'm not advertising for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available at almost every hydroponic
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go get yourself some Light Warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an experienced grower,
you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet what kind of soil to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to use the Light
Warrior, if you know why you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use Light Warrior, you know what to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, it's not, there's nothing
wrong with Light Warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some more experienced growers would
prefer other stuff, but it will work great
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if that's what you need,
it'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go get yourself some Light Warrior
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the grow store and get a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow some stuff,
get the proper stuff, put it under some
[SPEAKER_00]: good lights, put it under a T5 light,
maybe the short one, the little 18 inch
[SPEAKER_00]: long one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long they are,
like 18, 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the big three foot by
whatever one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the one with like the four bulbs in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a few, a few cups of the Light Warrior
soil in there and put the plants into the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt and then let them pop up like that
and then see how they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep that light close, they'll
start bushing out and then you'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll need a bigger light and
then you'll have to flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need a bigger light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I have not listened to all of
your podcasts yet, so I'm not sure if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something you have covered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to them at work on headphones
while I'm trimming trees in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that sounds like it could be so much
fun sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just want to go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a big roll up garage door at the
grow that we bring pallets in when we get
[SPEAKER_00]: deliveries and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring the, the scissor lift in through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring the forklift in through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when that thing opens up,
I'm like, la la la la la outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, sometimes it'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be out there trimming trees with
you in Missouri with the headphones on,
[SPEAKER_00]: not dealing with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be so rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he says, keep up the awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate your helping the grow
community, both very big and very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going off to hug my mom signed Anthony
P. Hey man, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great question about seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I can help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically more light and closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, don't, if you can put your
hand in the light where the seeds are,
[SPEAKER_00]: put your hand right at the top of the
seedlings and it should feel warm,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just be able to leave your hand
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be warm, but not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be like, Ooh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just want to leave your hand
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's what the plant wants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wants to get a nice little sun
tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wants to kick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't want to get cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wants to feel warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light closer, get more light on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will work just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would be concerned about
though, if you don't have enough light for
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings, you're not going to have enough
light to flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be time to start thinking
about bigger, better lights and more space
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting all that ahead of yourself
instead of having those seedlings stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: under a small space and not be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start getting that planned out before
we start those new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to start new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_02]: I take a minute to get any windows to do
when I lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Place hits like chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might be left up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got 50 on the ground with the project
rolling with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go quickly like the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got sticky in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter with me on the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no key blowing up because they
miss me when I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got no time for tripping off because
there's just too many a project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we got plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: $20 sack got no place in my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my bomb and hash like the thong and
ashtray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lace, ooh, shakes, the Buddha taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: About my mouth was shot straight at Rich's
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a power Peter Parker because he
know it's still no joking because we stay
[SPEAKER_02]: hot boxed on the freeway smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke a pound of butter every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke a fat pound of grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke a pound of butter every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke a fat pound of grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke a pound of butter every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke a pound of butter every day.
I smoke a fat pound of grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke a pound of butter every day.
I smoke a pound of grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that line from being enough respect
to all Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a broke now, so let me smoke out,
with a dance I've created.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making beats with Merlin, shaking up
the streets while bringing bacon to the
[SPEAKER_02]: table, and I'm able to keep it from ever
faking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking down the herb, I swear I'm
avoiding all the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I ain't really tripping, because I'm
legal with my fries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're under arrest for possession of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, this prescription says I'm legit and
legal in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get out of my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a fat pound of grass.
I smoke a fat pound of grass.
I smoke a fat pound of grass.
I smoke a fat pound of grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke a fat pound of grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke a fat pound of grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: You better hurry up and get over here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody thinks you ripped them off.
You better hurry up and get over here.
