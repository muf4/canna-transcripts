[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back Cannabis Community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 56 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a pro
grower, if you're a new smoker or a
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
activist, or if you're just someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, before we get started,
I have to send a big, huge thank you shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Kooten Kat from the Mystic Roots
Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for letting me use your
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining me today again is one of our
heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got King Kola to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean is going to drop some knowledge on
you guys today that is going to fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole thought process on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm here to give out some
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take it or leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just a little... That mic has
impotency problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes to droop after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My word is not law by any means,
but this is just how I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I have discovered through my
personal studies, but I just want to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: stop using molasses in your teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason is a lot of people are
using molasses on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, when you ask somebody what
they're using in your compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the same for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably on the first episode,
I probably even recommended certain rates
[SPEAKER_01]: to use molasses at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an evolving industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a while ago, basically,
somebody told me you need to quit using
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, I'll get back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never heard from them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stuck in my head, so I quit using
molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cut it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like things quit working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not acting like the bud hardener and
the sweetener like we think it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my thing, and then I get back in
touch with this person, and we discuss a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, like I was saying,
for a basic compost tea, what I used to
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend and what a lot of people are
using are earthworm castings or Alaskan
[SPEAKER_01]: humus or some sort of humic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using molasses, and then they're
using a kelp meal or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason that you use that
molasses in the tea is actually not for
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason that you had mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you use the molasses in a tea,
it's not so much as a bud hardener for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much a carbohydrate for the
plant as it is a food source for the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in the tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with molasses is it's a simple
carbohydrate, and simple carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_01]: feed simple organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the simplest way to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molasses is an extremely strong bacteria
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably heard before that
marijuana is a fungal dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like fungal dominant teas,
especially in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: By using molasses, you're going to be
encouraging bacterial growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The molasses not only feeds the bacteria,
but it feeds it at an enormous rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria is naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on our skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere and in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already going to be there in your
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably some of it's already going to be
in molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of bacteria out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you add this molasses, you start to
feed this bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria starts to eat the food,
and they start to digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is the growth of the bacteria
happens too fast, and the organisms will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually use up all of the available food
and oxygen resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually drop the dissolved oxygen
levels in your tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting molasses in your AAC tea will take
out one of those A's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will make it go anaerobic, and you will
no longer be having an aerated compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite you having bubblers running,
you're still going to take out the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll lower the dissolved oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're just harvesting anaerobic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically killing off everything we're
working to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding the thing that we thought was
fueling our fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: By adding molasses, you're just taking out
everything that you just put all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: money and time into.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just growing the bacteria at a
phenomenal rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out competing everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's eventually what you put on your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just Googled fungal dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do an entire episode on that just
by what I'm reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to catch up, Google fungal
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even begin to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much going on in fungal
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll change your thinking, but right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the teas, like I was saying,
so when you add the molasses, it can drop
[SPEAKER_01]: the dissolved oxygen levels for anybody
who's listening who wants to know
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Above eight parts per million of dissolved
oxygen is where you want your teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you're brewing aerobic
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between six parts per million and eight
parts per million, you are facilitating
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: These organisms out compete the aerobic
organisms that are at a rate of two to
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: These facilitate anaerobic zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where some really nasty things
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are in your compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bad organisms are in your compost,
such as really anaerobic or E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli or these other things, just nasties.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to multiply at an alarming
rate once you start creating this
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use that as a foliar spray,
you just sprayed E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli onto your plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is they actually,
when your tea starts to do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the organisms that produce acids that kill
anaerobic organisms in high enough
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities, these acids can stress and kill
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In no growing environment anywhere is
there a shortage of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no need to just feed more of
them and stress your plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other options instead of
molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right off the bat, just cut it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to do a tea, what I would
recommend would be, actually, here,
[SPEAKER_01]: one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so if you're going to start a
tea, I would just go with worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go with kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Castings and kelp meal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to, I've got everything written
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a whole computer in front of him,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to come prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came well prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of peeked at his notes a minute
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a, so basically for a really
basic compost tea, I'm going to roll with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Elaine Ingram's compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So her teas are basically compost or worm
castings or whatever you can source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can add in, instead of
molasses, you can add in a humic source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can add in like a, humic acid
derived from peat, like a Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicines Brilliant Black.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would recommend,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different options out
there, but you can add in a humic acid or
[SPEAKER_01]: in that place, you could add in a fish
hydrosolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for your base teas, every time I would
just go with worm castings and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of that, you can add in kelp meal
or alfalfa meal or anything like that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific to your stage, your plant stage
in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you want to start adding foods
for the fungi, basically if you're in veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: fish hydrosolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for vegetative growth, instead of using
molasses, replace it with fish
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrosolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now fish hydrosolate, it can go the same
way as molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can turn your tea anaerobic really
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're probably thinking
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I personally talk about
anaerobic teas and bukkashi and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things, which is, you know,
they're actually anaerobic fermentations
[SPEAKER_01]: and anaerobic compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because we want anaerobic
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want anaerobic bacteria in our
aerobic teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so they're separate but equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making a tea and then feeding that
to our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so when you're fermenting,
don't let oxygen get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're aerating, don't let it go
stagnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write that down, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as food for your teas,
like I was saying, if you need to improve
[SPEAKER_01]: your fungal count, which everybody wants
to, everybody wants fungal dominant teas,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can add a steel cut oats, bran powder,
shrimp shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's any sort of, really any
sort of like high protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can just pick that up at the health
food store, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick all of that up at the health
food store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's a lot of like,
I've seen a lot of stuff on people are
[SPEAKER_01]: people are starting to consume like fish,
hydrosolates and stuff, which I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm there yet, but I mean, I wouldn't
be surprised if you can pick that up at
[SPEAKER_01]: the health food store soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so you're just molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, take it how you want it,
you know, take it or leave it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend cutting it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've learned from very,
very reputable sources and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're these aren't people just,
you know, talking, you know, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are real scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are sitting there in front of
their microscopes and they're straining
[SPEAKER_01]: their minds and their eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think you need to try to give
yourself any sort of credit or your
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been on here enough and I think
people have realized that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've earned your credit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We respect your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at this for years and you teach
me stuff every time you come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but yes, I mean, just cut the cut the
molasses out of your teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use it every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every time my last batch of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used I used to use your recommendation
or the Rebs recommendation of molasses in
[SPEAKER_00]: my tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a tea just a few days ago with
some Bokashi bucket leachate in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually got way more foam without
the molasses on that bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best tea I've ever made was my
most recent without the molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, and the plants love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're going to get way better
results using beneficial microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: using things like a cold process fish
hydroslate like the Brown's fish
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroslate you grab from Rocky Mount Worm
Company, or you can make your own fish
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroslate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those food sources work way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're way more natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we eat natural food, our body absorbs
it much more naturally, instead of trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to McDonald's or whatever,
pull out the nutrients and poop out the
[SPEAKER_00]: crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you're able to absorb what you're
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like eating a pop tart or an apple.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's you know, how does your body
run off of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for teas, just keep it simpler,
the better, you know, just run your
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, run, you know, your kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to add a food source,
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I really like fish hydroslate.
[SPEAKER_01]: During veg, you see tremendous vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's how you really step away
from bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that way, if you are using
bottled nutrients, the only one you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using is the fish product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we using to feed the tea in
bloom?
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep saying fish hydroslate and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for if you're going to feed your tea in
bloom, soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a lot in your OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that goes right back into you need to
know what you're using, how much you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using, where you're sourcing it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go and you dump astronomical amount of
soft rock phosphate on your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to, you know, like I said,
that goes right back to you can be organic
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can be worse than all your
synthetic buddies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think I overused some OGT
because I wasn't I was thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said instead of every two weeks,
I was doing it every week because I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the plant sped up too much,
like you said, because they were burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were showing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiencies in like week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're just going too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more from like the the trichoderma
like strains that they have in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he has soft rock phosphate also in
there, which works as a food for the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a fungal food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also get your phosphates,
obviously, from introducing that into the
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great that's a great source of
if you need a bloom tea, for say,
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretically, you should have all of that
admitted in your soil and it'll just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of take up what it wants, which kind of
rolls into what we were originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our our original idea today was
to talk about building a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The molasses is unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are old school farmer tricks we were
taught that try it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make us do a test run set one set of
plants on one side of the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: one set on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add molasses to one set of tea or however
you're feeding and don't add molasses to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the difference for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you're not going to see enough
difference to like break the bank or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, keep your molasses around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it for plenty of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ is a lot of the fermentant plant
juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the Korean farming techniques
that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the homemade fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, if you're going to use it
for your sweetener purposes or your
[SPEAKER_01]: hardener purposes or your foliar sprays or
if you use it for stuff, but don't use it
[SPEAKER_01]: for the tea's food source and don't use it
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use it for your tea's food source
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like over-amping the tea basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making hyper little tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turning it into little kids just like
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out competing everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, for soil mixes, I really didn't
even know where to start for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that everybody has their own mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has their way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's super soils and there's layers and
there's no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a million ways to do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured maybe the best way to go
about it would be to kind of just discuss
[SPEAKER_01]: what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: A super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super soils are a term for a nutrient
charged soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool is the father of super soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool made it really famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically the idea is you're going to
create this nutrient rich mixture of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to layer the bottom of
your pot with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to plant your plant
actually into a less hot medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like say you would use a bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would take your five gallon container
and you'd fill the bottom so many inches
[SPEAKER_01]: up with your super soil mix and then add
in your bagged soil and then actually
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant your plant into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Theoretically you water your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots grow through the bagged soil
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come into the super soil and then you
never have to fertilize your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just always feed it water every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everything's already mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's already mixed into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one method of mixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another method for a lot of people is just
like a complete through and through mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Dragonfly Earth Medicine just does
a really, really awesome mix where they
[SPEAKER_01]: do, it's similar to the super soil,
but it's actually incorporated throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't like... Stir the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no like layering and you don't
pad it with, you know, other soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they'll do is they make their soil
and then they do what's a term called
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking, which is just composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they let their soil sit for a couple of
weeks or a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the longer the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, you can really
encourage natural process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to Dragonfly Earth
Medicine's feed, they've got some really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool things about how they'll,
you know, the soil that's cooking,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll treat with bukkashi and lactic
acid bacteria and they pour all their
[SPEAKER_01]: excess compost teas on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do these things too,
while your soil cooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do like really, it's more of a
botanical mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use like a kelp meal, alfalfa,
nettle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to their website, to their
feeds and kind of find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to give away out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them out.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've got some... Check out
Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get them on the show one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they were going to come here and
then they had to go back to Canada or
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right by Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to skip out on the show one
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pacific Northwest, they're just
holding it down up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, they're in Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to like Prague or... They went
all over... Istanbul.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when they come back, they're going
to do an interview with me and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tell me about all the things
they've seen around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've been perfecting the soil mix
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned them because they do like
a completely botanical base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's plant based with their mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of other people are
traditionally doing, especially like with
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rev and some other people,
Moonshine Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of other mixes out
there, which are all bone meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: blood meal, phosphates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real similar to Subcool's mix,
but it's the same idea that you mix it
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole batch and you let it
cook for a period of time and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to get away from the blood meal
and the bone meal, the feather meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bone meal, soft rock phosphate,
calm free metal, yarrow, fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood meal, which is your nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even need to get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many other nitrogens,
alfalfa, fish hydrously.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the most popular lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's so many other nitrogen
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even need to cover that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you can definitely source
where your products are coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me personally, I go with a very simple
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, I like to mix my own soil base.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best mixture I've ever used personally
was it's a product called Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a biodynamic compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a compost blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only available in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fortunate enough to come across a
couple of bags and it was probably some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best product they use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's in California that can send us a
couple of bags of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody hook me up, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you my PO box number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hook me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's a biodynamic blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have like yarrow and nettle and
dandelions and all sorts of cool stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use a compost and then cut it in
with perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, not perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a compost and then I cut it in with
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make my own like vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use the Malibu's compost,
Rocky Mountain worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll add in an aerator,
which is typically a lot of people use
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like perlite so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use diatomite because I've got a huge
bag of it I've had for like years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still working through it, but you can
use like pumice or lava rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to recommend people use things that
don't go away as fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, perlite floats to the top and it
grinds up really fine and it just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: goes away to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always recommend people to do like a
50% like lava rock or pumice or diatomite,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that doesn't break down as
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then do another 50, like the other
half do like a rice hole or buckwheat
[SPEAKER_01]: hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some, you know, more of a carbon
based aerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we put in our aerator and then
after your compost and your aerator,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you make the decision of whether or
not you're going to want to use cocoa core
[SPEAKER_01]: or peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like peat moss, but I like the
environment too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all comes from like one swamp in
Canada or something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you got it, like I said,
organics, it seems like it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome, but it's not always the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of got to pick what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually found best result.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a mixture of cocoa and peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about the oils that come
from the cocoa fiber that the plant really
[SPEAKER_00]: likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really like a mix of, I've been
playing around with different ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50, 50, 75, 25 of cocoa to peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of like a half and half mixture
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then outside of that, we'll go in and
then add a kelp meal crustacean,
[SPEAKER_01]: neem, oyster shell powder, glacial rock
dust, jimson.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we really want to get into it,
we'll add, you know, biochar and bukkashi
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of other natural farming inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's personally for like my home
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get into it with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys can too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to this episode, hit pause and
rewind all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen back and make a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't afford to buy a bunch of
shit, buy the first two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time, buy three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll make a better soil every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll start seeing good,
you should get great results right off the
[SPEAKER_01]: bat, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you play it back and you think it's too
overwhelming, I do work with dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a consultation company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you guys out there know
anybody who, I hate the word consult,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it, I do consultations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anybody out there wants to switch,
you know any facilities that want to
[SPEAKER_01]: switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all licensed over here, natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we've got our cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go in and help your favorite grow,
convert to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I work with a couple of different
shops and they always seem a little
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmed when I come in there and I
started running my mouth about mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: soils and you're going to get this and
this and this and you're going to mix it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the, when you can walk in there
and you can be like, yep, buy a pallet of
[SPEAKER_01]: this and I want a pallet of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've actually got a mixture for
everybody out there who wants to go and
[SPEAKER_01]: just buy a pallet of soil or you want to
go buy a bale of ProMix or some Sunshine
[SPEAKER_01]: 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just go and grab your Sunshine 4 or
your ProMix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend cutting in worm castings 10%
for your microbial source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would just add, and depending on
what you're going with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go with like a Sunshine 4
Advanced, they've got like a nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: starter pack, which is I think there's
some like minerals in there, other things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one's a really good one to go
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just add in your worm castings,
kelp meal, neem, neem cake, and crustacean
[SPEAKER_01]: meal or oyster shell powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of dependent on how you want to
grow personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good start right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've, I've tried them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, if you go to the king
underscore cola feed on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can look at the, there's pictures of
worms just all over the containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, top soils move in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually all done in Sunshine 4
with kelp, neem, crustacean, and oyster
[SPEAKER_01]: shell powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel like I'm getting some of
the best results that I've ever had with
[SPEAKER_01]: this super, between this mix and then the
mix I had mentioned earlier with Malibu
[SPEAKER_01]: compost are probably the two best results
I've gotten since I've started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's so hard to source a
solid like place to get compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can't do that and you can't make
your own compost, I mean, there's no shame
[SPEAKER_01]: in going and buying a bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can always start a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to make some over the
past three or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long I've been talking
about the Bokashi bucket, but I see it
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into funk inside that bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will have a, that's a five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially I'll have five gallons of
compost to add to a whole bunch of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a month or two, I will have my
own amazing compost started from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, even like even buying soil
from the store using the nicest castings
[SPEAKER_01]: that money can buy, like a Rocky mile worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's still crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after amending the soil,
soil, it's amazing how cheap this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say the name of this,
like, shop that I'm working for,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will say that they're running 488,
20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we priced them out at a dollar 20 per
gallon of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suck on that one, Synthetix.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to rely on quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a quick commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to sneak into commercial,
but I have to do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great time, uh, because a
lot of what we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic portion is portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try this commercial again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic portions of this episode were
sponsored by my friends at the Rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in
Colorado Springs for fresh worm castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: African nightcrawlers, red wigglers,
and all of your soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has
Dragonfly Earth Medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they have the fish hydro slates there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've got brilliant black humic from
Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they have a lot of the stuff we talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grab right there at the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there that you can actually get
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening far away, you can get
the product shipped to your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the same worm casting Sean and
I use in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the same amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out www.rockymountainwormcompany
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're in Colorado Springs,
Denver or Pueblo, drive to 411 Tijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Street in Colorado Springs, Colorado,
and make sure you tell them you heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about them on the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do another two more quick ads
just because I have to get them done.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys pay for this and I feel bad if
I don't do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate cutting off Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got so much good shit to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course this podcast is brought to
you by our good friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them you listen to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get commercial pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll save a few bucks on everything you
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it worth going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have what you want,
let them know they will order it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jesse and also shout out to
LaDonna.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a growers meeting there last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big huge shout out to everybody that
showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that place was packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cloudy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last ad I promise.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to interrupt the show,
but those guys paid me money for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, what else you got on making your
own soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to talk about something
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, I think that that's a,
this is a good point to go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: HighGrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I do want to mention, cause I feel
like we've been talking, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: snub your other people, but we're talking
about, uh, no, I mean, cause I was telling
[SPEAKER_01]: people to go and grab soil mix,
you know, go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, we'll, we'll work with Jesse a
little bit and we'll try to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we'll call it a Rocky Mount Natural
Farming mix up there for you at the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, they already carrying the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already got the castings up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got Krokashi up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, you talk to Jesse, we can get
you fixed with the Rocky Mount Natural
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming mix, which is, like I said,
it's, I mean, Pro Mix, Sunshine 4,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp, Crestation, Neem, get to rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get, Hey guys at HighGrow,
here's my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to set up one little section,
just a shelf that we can just walk right
[SPEAKER_00]: there and get this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it'll be the grow from your heart,
uh, Rocky Mountain, Worm Castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: HighGrow, indoor growing supplies,
little bonus section and just go right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be some Krokashi there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do the same thing up at the Worm
Shop for you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my proposal to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go, if you can't, if you can't source
compost and all of that jazz, then go to
[SPEAKER_01]: your local hydro store, HighGrow,
and, uh, grab you a bag of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: get you some basic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the trick is, is to figure out
what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't like this, like one size fits
all idea of growing, um, cause it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, you probably water
completely differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet completely differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I used your soil mix and methods,
I would probably slaughter those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee I'd kill every single one of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you do the same thing in my
style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that you're a better grower
than me or vice versa?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of you've got to dial
it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would recommend starting out
with a ProMix or a Sunshine Four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, once you get a grower two down with
that and your really basic soil
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments, then all Sunshine Four and
ProMix is, is peat moss and an aerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so source those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually what my last run was done in
with Sunshine Four ProMix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, so, I mean,
I think people get overwhelmed when you
[SPEAKER_01]: start talking about the conversion to
organics, but if they only knew how close
[SPEAKER_01]: they already were, you know, so many
synthetic growers are using Sunshine Four
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're using ProMix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, next time you do that,
just add in a microbial source,
[SPEAKER_01]: like earthworm castings, add in some kelp
meal, you know, to help prevent against,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fungus gnats and white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spider mites add in some neem cake or
crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're mixing soil anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be, you know, you shouldn't,
I don't think you should open the bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: just start pulling out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should dump it into something,
kind of spread it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to learn that synthetic,
like I said, I've always grown
[SPEAKER_01]: organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, I see a lot of the commercial
synthetic growers and kind of how they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really surprised to see even
they amending the shit out of their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're growing, you know,
in ProMix and they go and pour in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still running and kill it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was something we were trying
to talk to a friend about last night is
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that balance between the worm
castings and the advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, can I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were trying to tell him gently that
your advanced is just going to kill all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw away those advanced bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, if you're wanting to make
the, if you want to make the switch,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you need to not get advanced
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get something like a general organics
or roots organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even botanic air is not as organic as
they try to advertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's far from it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even if you were to go age old is
a really old school product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know so many people who crush it
with age old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend who grows nothing,
but I read genetics with nothing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but age old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you want to talk about low cost of
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares if, I mean, you know,
you'll yield good, but even if you didn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so fucking cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only paying for packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the beauty of organics,
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making the switch and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really seen a difference in my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they perform better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't seem, and I do, I haven't grown
cannabis for a long time and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: always seem like they were thriving to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I'm using the organics,
I can see that I was missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look, they're just look, they're
waxier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have, they have more,
uh, the cuticles on the leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the stems are more robust and I was
feeding, I've fed all the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: brands of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, and I'm definitely noticing a
difference with just basic and just small
[SPEAKER_00]: jumps to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even anything major.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you tell me you, since you come
from the synthetic world, is it easier?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot of people tell me it's more
complicated, but I am not the most,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do a lot of other stuff,
but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in my grow like I used to be in
my, my plants are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I think this seems to make more
sense to me than mixing up bottles like a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've read all of my bottles anyway,
so I know what that's coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know that that's chicken shit and
seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I just use chicken shit and
seabird guano?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and I think I didn't trust myself to
make those mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd burn something or whatever,
but there are so many guides between you,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rev and every forum on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find the correct mixture for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this podcast now, this is a good
reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are going to be way more
forgiving to you putting the guano on it
[SPEAKER_01]: than to you putting a bottled nutrient
that's got guano in it on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more concentrated and I can
definitely add too much of that way
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even like using guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stay away from any kind of
shit in my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guano is actually extremely unsustainable
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's really bad for you to
breathe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know a lot of people are diehard
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, I think it like produces
some really awesome outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse will swear by it for the outdoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Jesse would chop us down right
now for saying bad things about his
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guano is pretty banging for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other options, but hey,
to each his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're dissing your growing methods,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not dissing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to encourage you to do
more sustainable, healthier things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're okay with it, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to smoke poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't eat GMO foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a certain lifestyle that I try to
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I incorporate that all the way into the
medicine and the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hang out with people who eat meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hang out with people who grow
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: To each his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get attacked a lot on Instagram and a
lot of these other places when I try to
[SPEAKER_01]: put information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I get met with a lot of
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not trying to tell people how to
do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to put information out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't argue with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like it, take it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, unfollow me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, follow someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of other Instagram pages to
troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hit those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, if you ever have
questions and you're serious and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to know something, just direct message me,
email me, email Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you the knowledge you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we know we've got resources for all
kinds of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny because we were at a growers
meeting last night and Sean and I were
[SPEAKER_00]: both stumped on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people looked at us like, well,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't know, then what is the
answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, sorry, guys,
there's some shit we're not going to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me three days to research it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, you might have to call Jim
Ferrer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I feel like people have this,
like, I don't know, they've got this idea
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can just look at one picture on
your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're going to send me one direct
message and I'm going to know what you fed
[SPEAKER_01]: them for the past three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll try.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes, yeah, that one last night
was a weird challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was powdery something mildewish looking
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that was a case of,
it's all too familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know him personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually working with him on that
before the meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was introduced to me through a friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I thought it was powdery mildew
originally, and then we thought it was pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, and he thought it was newtlock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all too familiar of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually, you know, wasn't too familiar
with growing, went to the local hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: store, not high grow, because if Jesse
would have helped him, the guy would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he goes to these horrible competitors
here in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they set him up on what he thinks is
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give him a cocoa nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's running it turns out it's peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, so it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not his fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's learned so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his plants are still alive,
even after all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I mean, we saw fucked up
pictures of him, but hey, they're still
[SPEAKER_01]: kicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he makes it to harvest, that's what
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but perseverance, you know,
you just got to stay committed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that I grow beautiful plants
every time you're out of your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I just don't put pictures of the
ugly ones on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of ugly shit that I have
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit it one time I had and this was
years ago, the first time it was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time I said I was in a new house,
growing in a brand new basement in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd never grown in there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to dial in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a white rhino plant in a seven
gallon pot that probably weighed between
[SPEAKER_00]: five and six ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to cut it down and I noticed
powdery mildew all up the one side that
[SPEAKER_00]: was near the exterior wall corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wall was colder than the whole
rest of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Mike was there helping me trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Hey, Mike, watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I chopped the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually he's got a hand on it when I
cut it so that it doesn't timber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I just cut that son of a
bitch right to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just timber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me like, what the hell,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, there's powdery mildew on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're throwing the whole plant away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people ask me all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know if it works?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how thousands and thousands of
dollars worth of just R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to try something
crazy, try it on one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the option, don't do
something, don't defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying extreme defoliation on
one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do it to more than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a difference and I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, guys, I doubted it in the
beginning, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned this the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In every scientific experiment,
for God's sake, make sure you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe take some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're high and we forget a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you don't want to run a six
month trial to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take pictures if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stay there so you have notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should go for about five more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, the last episode was short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you listen to every minute of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell how long you listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you liked that solo episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do solo shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we covered, dude, the molasses
thing is going to be the groundbreaker for
[SPEAKER_00]: the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered soil pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any wrap up notes for soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, huge thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave it a hug after like 45 minutes
before we even recorded, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, how long does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, allow two or three hours
when you get here because we like to dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is a special day, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get teary eyed for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to save it to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Jenny Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, this episode is being recorded on
Jenny Kush's birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk too much about it because
it'll make me cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wish you were still here with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, Google Jenny Kush if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must support Jenny Kush and the
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green and healthy cannabis and turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the next episode, I was told that
Spence and the Garden of Weedon are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming, so hopefully we can get Spence
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he's coming tomorrow night to
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope he brings Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mike's invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I am going to record with the Grimy
Gatsby and turpex next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got an episode coming up with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the recording equipment up to
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to go hang out at the Turpey Boy
house and hit the mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about Golden Goat and
Lemon Jeffery seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right on schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm saying like 85, 80 days from now,
we should have some new seeds ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the next episode, I'm going to talk to
Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next episode, I'm going to
talk to Spence about fucking rosin,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys seen rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Soyl Grown and the rosin
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually turned some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a whole bunch of food grade,
cooking grade or whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: it from my last wash, my last harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, jars full of it sitting in the
cupboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, shout out to Soyl Grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are on Instagram, check out at
Soyl Grown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is killing it with some new
things called rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are going to try making rosin
tech, don't burn yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got to say, because that's
going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen rosin tech happen, and then
we've seen people follow suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm waiting for the rosin tech
burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to be next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're on Instagram, check out
Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I want to talk about more in the
future is the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I'm experimenting with
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot believe I didn't do this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot to Rocky Mountain Worm
Company and Sean for hooking me up with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game changer, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added the liquid that came out of there
to my worm tea, and it's the best worm tea
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw results within 24 hours on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody out there, check out
the Bokashi bucket on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have their own page.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a super awesome group of guys down
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Hawaiian gents that are super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the pleasure of meeting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually gave one of the guys one of
their first dabs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually at the Emerald Cup,
but I was dabbing them out on some full
[SPEAKER_01]: melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But shout out to the Bokashi bucket guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can pick up the buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're Hydro Shop or the Rocky Mountain
Worm Company does have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not near us, you can get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bokashi bucket guys have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also Whole Foods sells them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a Whole Foods in your area,
go check out the chicks in the yoga pants
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ugg boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pick yourself up a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, let's wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's much left to say
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have probably took four pages of
notes because I took a page and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys wrote all that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Hippie Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you write down a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you went through seven or eight
pages on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had notes too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you came prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for coming, dude.
