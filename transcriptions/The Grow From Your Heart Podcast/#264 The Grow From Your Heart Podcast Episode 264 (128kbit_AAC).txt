[SPEAKER_02]: music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat, Koo, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the
podcast is brought to you by our friends
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new seeds for your lineup,
visit the Hella Dank Seed Bank at dankseed
[SPEAKER_02]: .store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody had a good holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody stuffed themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you shared a meal with some friends
and family, and I hope you are safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I hope you got to consume some
cannabis with somebody new over the
[SPEAKER_02]: holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got to smoke cannabis with a new
family member over the holiday,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Twitter, it's at gfyhpodcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email is growfromyourheartathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you smoked or consumed cannabis in some
way with somebody new over this
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanksgiving holiday, especially a family
member, I would like to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share your story with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of smoking with people,
what am I smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a gigantic dab of some Berry
Cooler Shatter, and it really hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I've been talking about
different kinds of concentrates here on
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke the HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke the batters, the rosins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke a lot of rosins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a lot of batters, smoke a lot of
Ambrosia and live resins, and the QRCs and
[SPEAKER_02]: the HDFSE.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, no, don't go Google and QRC,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just made that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't go Google that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Alien Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I was getting at is I think I
like Shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some butters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a lot of great stuff available,
but I tend to reach for the Shatter most
[SPEAKER_02]: often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about the Shatter, it's
affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me a giant dab, and it seems old
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to when Hash started getting really
popular again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatter is where it all started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really seem to like the Shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, I think my next dab
is going to be a dab of this Screaming
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangerines batter from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a Berry Cooler and
Screaming Tangerines type of episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are smoking on something
delicious with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, in this podcast, I do want to
talk about a little bit of a debate
[SPEAKER_02]: between organic and synthetic nutrients
and organic and synthetic gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I get there, I would like to
read some iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's turn down this music just a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get into some iTunes comments and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if
you would leave me a review on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening to the podcast on
iTunes, simply go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_02]: search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, scroll down about halfway.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a big square with my face in
the middle to red, yellow, and green
[SPEAKER_02]: square with my face in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have three options.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one in the middle will be ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go there, you'll be able to type
in a customer review, and you'll be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to leave a star-based rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, most people, everybody except for
one person, has left a five-star review or
[SPEAKER_02]: a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: One person has left a four-star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody seems to be leaving positive
reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two reviews I have not read,
so let's get to them here on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: This first iTunes customer review was left
by a person who calls himself Maddie E.,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline says, the best, and they gave
me five stars, and then they said,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is by far the best fully
comprehensive podcast about cannabis out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Rasta Jeff, for all of the
knowledge and good vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Maddie E., you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great, encouraging
review and the five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you find my show to be
comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I feel like I may over-talk a
certain subject, but I'm really trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you guys don't make mistakes out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to give you the best advice and
guidance I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make eye contact with anybody when
I'm doing this, so I don't know if what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying is sinking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see any facial expressions,
so I'm not sure if people look confused or
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're catching on, so I just
over-talk my shit until I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you find it comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thanks for the great review,
and thanks for the five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna read the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from a person who calls
themselves Denny D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Batt, and the headline was great podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they gave me five stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great podcast and very informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta Jeff gives detailed information and
sound advice in all growing applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guests are always good, too,
and I like it when they ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, thank you, Denny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the great review.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you find it informative because,
like I said, I like to talk my ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I feel like I may be
over-rambling, so I'm glad you appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good to hear that people say they
like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you find my detailed information
useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you don't find it overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I could get to, get to be,
in all applications, all growing
[SPEAKER_02]: applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not sure that I talk enough
about hydro and stuff like that because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not my wheelhouse, but I will try
to get people in here to talk about things
[SPEAKER_02]: that are out of my comfort zone and teach
me and you all things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you like my guests, and I'm glad
you like it when we ramble because
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we do take too many dabs,
we meaning myself, and we do get quite
[SPEAKER_02]: rambley here, so I'm glad you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the great review, and thanks
for the five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, you guys, I would appreciate
it if everybody who listens on iTunes
[SPEAKER_02]: would go to the iTunes store and just
leave a short, sweet review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think about the
podcast, and I will read your review on a
[SPEAKER_02]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into the main topic
of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, at the start of the show,
I said that I wanted to talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing with synthetic versus
growing with organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get too far into this,
I want to make some disclaimers and say
[SPEAKER_02]: that I am not on either side of this
debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a cannabis grower, and I support you
growing cannabis the way that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate about doing so.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to grow organically,
if you want to grow no-till, if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow with salts and rockwool,
however you want to grow, I support you,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I love you for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you do so safely and carefully,
and you don't apply pesticides that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make people sick, as long as
you're not a corrupt piece of shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: I support you growing cannabis your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also being said, I grow mostly from
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a large cultivation facility where
we have lots of plants, lots of lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am well-versed in working with bottles
and synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the same hand, I've got a lot of
experience using organics and growing
[SPEAKER_02]: organically, but I do not have nearly the
amount of experience and knowledge as I
[SPEAKER_02]: have with bottled and synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I may seem biased in my debate here,
but I'm going to try to play evenly on
[SPEAKER_02]: both sides so I can keep this argument
fair for both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also feel like this shouldn't be too
much of an argument because we can all be
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people are haters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people have put a lot of time
and energy into perfecting their
[SPEAKER_02]: technique, and they feel like they've got
some hot shit going on, and they feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to worry about any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to play that game right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to do an unbiased, honest,
personal debate between organic versus
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetics when it comes to growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to actually take a quick dab at
the screaming tangerines before I get into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I get back, synthetics versus
organics, round one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am back with the ever-so-pleasant taste
of screaming tangerines in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I just bit into a tangerine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's talk about growing with
synthetic or organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I said it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people think that they have some
special technique mastered.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that grow organically,
a lot of the guys that grow no-till,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the guys that grow some fancy
Korean natural farming sort of method,
[SPEAKER_02]: they seem to be kind of sensitive when it
comes to bottled nutrients, and they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk trash right away because they say
growing with bottles is too easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, sometimes a new grower may need
something easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't all have all day to dedicate to
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottled nutrients are easy, so that's good
for a beginner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good for a hobby grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for somebody who is fully
employed and has a full-time job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for somebody who has a little
bit of space and doesn't have space for
[SPEAKER_02]: making extra things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't have a lot of room,
so bottled nutrients are good for these
[SPEAKER_02]: types of folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottled nutrients are good for large
facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottled nutrients can be used on all types
of grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: For someone to dismiss the idea of growing
with synthetic bottled nutrients because
[SPEAKER_02]: it is easy just seems closed-minded and
silly to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let anyone on the internet
discourage you because you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow with synthetic bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most common practice in a
large-scale facility, and you're not doing
[SPEAKER_02]: anything wrong as long as you're flushing
your product at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, it may be easy, but it's also
reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottled nutrients are reliable,
and in most cases, they are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that whenever I buy a bottle,
and I'm just going to pick a bottle,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say, what's in front of
me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a white jar in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say whenever I buy white jar
nutrients, and that's not even a real
[SPEAKER_02]: brand, so I'm not advertising for anybody,
I know that there's a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: this product and a certain amount of this
product or ingredient inside of that
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I buy it, it should be
within a certain range so that my nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: mixes are consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my product, white jar, should be
reliable and available when I need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be a con to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottle that you're trying to get may
not be available in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not have a grow store in your
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not be able to grow or go to the
grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for guys like that, you may want to
lean more toward the organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a farming area, people are
going to be buying farming shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the organic stuff is going to be
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be the way to go for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like the bottled nutrients are
reliable and available, and almost
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's got Amazon available to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like everybody should be able to
get just about any bottled product shipped
[SPEAKER_02]: to them as long as they can find it on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the pros of bottled nutrients is
feed charts are easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what brand of nutrients you are
using out there, you can type it in and
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be a feed chart available for
that brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can adjust that feed chart
for your particular plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the feed charts are easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making organics, you've got
websites like Build A Soil and places like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to have to build a soil
and you're going to have to get all those
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments and things shipped to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to have to mix them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully you get all the mixes right
and hopefully nothing is too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you get it mixed,
you're going to have to let it cook and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to have to sit for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the cons of working with
organics is that it's not as consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not as reliable in my experience
and in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get it dialed in, it will be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure that getting it dialed in
will take a couple of trials and errors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're brand new and you're
growing with this soil that you just made
[SPEAKER_02]: and your plant's messing up, your soil is
mixed and you're going to have a hard time
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out what's wrong because you're a
new grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've got to figure out what's
wrong with the plant and how to fix the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you've got a relationship with the
soil, that's not as hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're a brand new grower and you
don't know your plants, you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: your soil as well, this is where bottle
nutrients may be able to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may look at the plant and you can say,
shit, this is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to the internet, the internet tells
you or you listen to Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We figure out what's wrong with your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can get the correct bottle and
you can treat the plants with that bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds simple and that's the
way some people need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys that are doing the organics,
you've already built that relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure most of you that are doing the
organics started with bottles,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of us start on bottles,
then we graduate up to the organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you learn to spot the
deficiencies so that when you mix up your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, you can see what was wrong with the
plant and you can learn how to fix it by
[SPEAKER_02]: top dressing or mix it in a tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also feel like a lot of you guys grow in
the organics and no-tills.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't start with bottle nutrients
and graduate to the organics, I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: you started with some sort of
horticultural experience in your
[SPEAKER_02]: background and your family is where a lot
of you guys learned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've noticed is from paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I was gonna get to, what I was
talking about is feed charts are
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the great pros of growing
with bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feed charts are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can Google it, you can print it out,
you can post it up on the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feed charts are reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandma and grandpa's old organics
recipes, crazy old man Steve's organic
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe, Mountain Tom's recipe,
that shit's gonna work if you've got that
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody gave you that recipe on how to
grow cannabis, on how to mix up things,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to prep things, how to feed things,
as long as somebody passed that down to
[SPEAKER_02]: you, but that's not available to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where bottle nutrients come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody had somebody in their family
to teach them this kind of stuff or not
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody had it as a passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bottles are good for those folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's talk about the cost of
bottles versus organics, the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing about the cost of bottled is
you're paying for water to be shipped
[SPEAKER_02]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just say if you're buying a white
jar products and that company is in
[SPEAKER_02]: California and a lot of people and a lot
of their stuff that they're sourcing comes
[SPEAKER_02]: from California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably gonna come from hopefully
states around there, but maybe there's
[SPEAKER_02]: shit they can't get in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they have to have part of their
ingredients shipped from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've got a pallet of stuff being
shipped from Massachusetts to California
[SPEAKER_02]: to get distributed into a bunch of
bottles, to get mixed with water,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get back on a truck, to get shipped to
a grow store in Colorado so that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: buy it, so that you can drive it to your
house, so that you can then add more water
[SPEAKER_02]: to it and then feed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're buying bottled nutrients,
you're paying for trucks to drive across
[SPEAKER_02]: the country over and over again is kind of
what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying for people to ship you
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also paying for plastic bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the organic stuff, sure some of
the organic stuff does come in bottles,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of the organic stuff is being
produced by the organic grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making it themselves along with
their cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a symbiotic grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing the cover crop in the pot
that the cannabis is growing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing, so it's all happening in
one container.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's less packaging, less shipping,
and less harm to the environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's something we're gonna talk
about here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the difference in cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: With bottled nutrients, you're paying for
a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying for a lot of labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying for a lot of brand names.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to organic amendments,
a lot of that stuff comes in a cardboard
[SPEAKER_02]: box.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have a brand name on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it was possibly grown by another
local farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it was traded from farmer to
farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it was grown, like I said
earlier, by the grower that is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics is kind of cheaper because you
don't have to pay for anything to be
[SPEAKER_02]: processed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're buying bat shit, you are getting
bat shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're buying liquid bat shit from a
nutrient company, you're probably getting
[SPEAKER_02]: bat shit and water, and then something
else that they put in there so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: could write on the label, hey,
there's this other cool shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So organics may be a little bit cheaper,
but that is probably mostly because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to pay for that advanced
nutrients or that botanic hair label on
[SPEAKER_02]: your bottle, and you don't have to pay for
as much processing of the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a little bit on the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about, I said, the availability
of bottles in organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier I mentioned that if you lived in
some places, like if you live in a farming
[SPEAKER_02]: area, you may not have a hydroponic store
in your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not have the hydro warehouse or
grow warehouse for a long distance around
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to go to Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that farming store, at that garden
supply store, or at the whatever you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got in your area, you may have a whole
bunch of agricultural and horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: supplies available to you that you can use
to make great organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that you can find everything that
Frosty spoke about, either at your local
[SPEAKER_02]: garden supply store, or if you're in that
type of area, maybe one of your local
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers has got what you're looking for,
and you guys can work out something,
[SPEAKER_02]: put a few bucks in his pocket,
maybe return a few buds to his pipe when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what you could work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said earlier, everybody's got
Amazon, so you can get your hands on every
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient that you can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably get your hands on every
amendment you could think of somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're gonna grow organics,
you probably wanna source everything as
[SPEAKER_02]: locally as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get it, that's not always possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about, one of the downsides
to organics is the extra prep time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanna make some soil, if you wanna
make some teas, almost all of that organic
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, especially the ferments,
those things all take time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your first grow, you may be out of
rhythm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may take you a couple of grows to get
your rhythm down, because your teas need
[SPEAKER_02]: to cook for 24 or 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to brew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your soil needs to cook for like three to
six, maybe eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what you're putting in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of your organic stuff is going to
take more prep, more cook, and more plan
[SPEAKER_02]: time, which means it's also going to take
more space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my opinion, that's some of the cons
of growing organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, one of the things that you don't get
as much with bottled nutrients that you do
[SPEAKER_02]: really get when you're growing organically
is some stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the organic nutrients and a lot
of the organic amendments, any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fermentations, a lot of the compost teas,
a lot of the teas you're gonna brew,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to smell terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a small house or a small
space, it's gonna stink it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna take more time, it's gonna
take a little more space, and it might
[SPEAKER_02]: stink a little bit more if you're using
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a weirdo like me, you may enjoy
some of those funky ass smells,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it may be the highlight of your day
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may take you a little more time if
you're gonna make teas and if you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: make your own soils and things like that,
but if that's what you want to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's another thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more stuff, if you want to be
more involved in your garden, that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to pre-plan your organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have your, if you're going to
make your own pesticides, if you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: make your own sprays, you have to get on
top of those way before it's time to need
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the good things about bottled
pesticides and bottled nutrients is if you
[SPEAKER_02]: see a problem, you can walk over there and
grab that bottle and shake it up and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can mix it and you can apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no waiting, but it's also a
dangerous pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got its pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to pre-plan your organics a
little bit more than I feel like you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got to pre-plan your synthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's that extra space for the
extra, the trash can that you're brewing
[SPEAKER_02]: or the five gallon buckets you're brewing
your teas in, your jars that you're making
[SPEAKER_02]: ferments in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that takes a little extra space,
not a whole bunch because you'd have
[SPEAKER_02]: bottled nutrients anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're making things, like we heard
Frosty say that he grinds stuff up real
[SPEAKER_02]: small.
[SPEAKER_02]: He puts some stuff in a blender.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's already got a grinder and a
blender.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that in my grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be two more things that I
would have to add.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a little bit more extra
equipment, but it'll be worth it because
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have to ship a bunch of bottles
across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see how it's weighing out?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, there are pros and cons to both
of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with organics, it's much easier to
reuse and recycle your soil, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going no-till, so that means less
trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, the less stuff you have to throw
away for our environment, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to that part here
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot easier to recondition and
recycle and reuse soil that was grown in
[SPEAKER_02]: organically, especially the no-till style.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just pull a plant out and go back
right back in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you try to recycle and reuse your
synthetic or your soil that was fed with
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nutrients, it may be too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be stuff stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, yes, you did flush,
but sometimes that some stuff will stick
[SPEAKER_02]: in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't recommend regrowing in soil
that you used synthetic nutrients in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could throw that outside and put that
in the veggie garden outside next summer
[SPEAKER_02]: or do something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it turn outside in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe mix it with some fresh dirt with a
bunch of organics, but I wouldn't go
[SPEAKER_02]: straight back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs some love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs some reconditioning and it may be
too hot and it may be kind of funky from
[SPEAKER_02]: having all of those synthetic nutrients
poured through it, even if you did flush
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like reusing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would mix it with some fresh dirt at
least, but I would recommend putting it
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the sun bake all that crap out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the earth do what it does to it and
fix it for you and just get some fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt for inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're growing with organics,
it seems to be more forgiving in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are not pouring concentrated nutrients
into your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you make a little bit of a mistake,
if you over-measure or under-measure,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like organics gives you a lot more
leeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not pouring, like I said,
concentrated chemicals into the root zone,
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding your plant an overdose really
easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the plants kind of know what
to take and what to absorb and what to eat
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more when you're going
organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're going synthetically,
you're kind of force-feeding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's buffered.
[SPEAKER_02]: They suck it all up and they can over-feed
themselves very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's very easy to get a salt buildup
problem with synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your pH gets off a little bit or you
start getting a salt buildup, you start
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a lockout, your plants start
changing colors, shit starts going bad
[SPEAKER_02]: really quickly, that's much less likely
when you're growing with organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to challenge me and go crazy and
feed your plants a bunch of ridiculous
[SPEAKER_02]: organic shit because you can cause
problems with the organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying it's a little bit more
forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, since I said that, I kind of
triggered myself into a whole nother rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, don't be sold by the word
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic has become such a buzzword lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can print organic on a package and
put it next to a package that doesn't say
[SPEAKER_02]: organic on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be the same damn thing and I
guarantee you the one with the word
[SPEAKER_02]: organic on it is going to sell just
because of the word organic printed on the
[SPEAKER_02]: package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is organic, but they don't print it
on the bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet if I printed it on one bottle,
you would buy that one instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet if I printed gluten-free,
organic, dairy-free, sodium-free,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I put that shit on there and didn't put
it on the other one, the bottle next to it
[SPEAKER_02]: would sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful being sold by the word organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyanide is organic, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyanide can fucking kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's organic, all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because people say their plants are
organic doesn't mean they're perfectly
[SPEAKER_02]: safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean they're harmless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be sold by buzzwords.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just talking about just
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about in every product you
consume, every product you rub on your
[SPEAKER_02]: body, any product you put on your face,
read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic on the label does not mean it's
all organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic doesn't mean that a product,
excuse me, is specifically safer for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, read about, let's just pick one
on this list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read about nicotine sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicotine sulfate is organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neurotoxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they tested it on humans,
it killed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also approved in organic farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before you are too mesmerized by the
word organic, keep in mind that things
[SPEAKER_02]: like cyanide and nicotine sulfate are
organic, and they can kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's get back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I wanna talk about is mono
ammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the bloom boosters that you buy,
especially powdered bloom boosters,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's one in particular that I'm not
sure I wanna say the name of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is mostly mono ammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is mostly what the whole product is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now mono ammonium phosphate, excuse me,
is formed when a solution of phosphoric
[SPEAKER_02]: acid is added to ammonia until the
solution is distinctly acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is largely used in agricultural
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That information actually came from
Wikipedia, but I knew that already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just reading it off there to keep
myself in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes, cannabis grown with a lot of
mono ammonium phosphate has been proven to
[SPEAKER_02]: give people a headache and have adverse
health reactions to people who already had
[SPEAKER_02]: a compromised immune system or were
already experiencing a medical condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are growing with synthetic
nutrients, check your bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see if you are applying mono ammonium
phosphate or dio ammonium phosphates.
[SPEAKER_02]: MAP and DAP are commonly used in
fertilizers, but I'm starting to think
[SPEAKER_02]: they should not be used in things we
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure your fertilizers don't have
mono ammonium phosphate or dio ammonium
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they do, maybe consider switching
bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe consider switching to organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanna read more about MAP and DAP,
Google Kyle Cushman and MAP and DAP
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of great articles will pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle is the one that brought this to my
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle Cushman actually grows with a program
that he calls Vega Matrix and it is vegan
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's organic with no animal products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the line that he did put out had
some, there was some type of ocean
[SPEAKER_02]: creature in one of his products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But veganic growing, you guys,
no animal products at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means no poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no bat guano, no sea bird guano,
no chicken shit, no horse manure,
[SPEAKER_02]: no cow manure, no poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: All veganic, no shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his sales pitch, no shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we've talked about MAP and
DAP.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about veganic growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about one thing that you
organic, non-bottled growers are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the advantage on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one thing that most of us don't
think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day, shit's gonna go wrong and there
will not be an electrical grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will not be a grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will not be Amazon to deliver your
shit to your front door.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have one thing, we can still grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we've got the sun and maybe just a nice
patch of dirt, we can still grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys that are growing organically,
when the end of the world comes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys are going to win because there
will be no grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no feed chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you guys are going to have the
advantage then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the advantages of growing
organically, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more of the great benefits and
advantages of growing organically are the
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Us guys growing out of bottled nutrients,
we're just sucking up resources and
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually the resources we're sucking up
are going to run out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not able to provide ourselves with
the amounts of products that we need
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're not making it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're relying on a manufacturer,
distributor, a vendor, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several steps in our chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not sustainable, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, so in my opinion,
I don't think my grow I've got a large
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial medical grow that I'm in charge
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do not think that I could run it
organically with my level of experience
[SPEAKER_02]: and produce the quality and quantity and
consistency that we do with synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think on a large scale, like what I'm
doing indoors, I think the bottled
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nutrients are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were in a greenhouse or outdoors,
I may change my mind on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so far, I think that the application
for indoors is a synthetic environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as soon as I go outdoors,
I would switch to the organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to sustainability,
I think you guys doing the organics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can recycle your own dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are using, you're recycling your food
waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are doing positive things for the
environment, which is what I want to move
[SPEAKER_02]: into next.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottled nutrient guys are ruining the
environment slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're shipping bottles of water back and
forth across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wasting a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reliability for large scale,
the ease for a new grower, the ease for a
[SPEAKER_02]: hobby grower, those are the things that
make bottled nutrients worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the long term environmental costs are
carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what would make switching to
organics worth it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since I run a large scale production
facility that is based on numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if I don't produce those numbers,
there are consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot take the risks of switching to a
synthetic regimen and having to relearn
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got our bottled system figured out
very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pulling great lab tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pulling great waves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our patients are happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The owners are happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't make the switch right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we started some shit outdoor,
I would hire a guy like Frosty or a guy
[SPEAKER_02]: like Sean to come fully educate me or a
guy like Jesse to come fully educate me on
[SPEAKER_02]: the outdoor setups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would be a black belt outdoor
grower, just like those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's wrap it up here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about, in summation,
let's talk about the pros and cons of
[SPEAKER_02]: bottled versus synthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of the pros of growing from
organic nutrients is the sustainability,
[SPEAKER_02]: the positive effect on the environment,
the recycling that we're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: the long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clean medicine, I think that that is a
great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability to make your own nutrients,
I think that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the cons of growing organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of extra prep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need more space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's definitely gonna take more
planning and more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some of the pros and cons of growing
with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are available and they are reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody with enough time to mix up some
nutrients and read a feed chart should be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to work a garden ran off of bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is easy if you're a new grower,
if you're a hobby grower, if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody growing in a closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier if you're running a large
scale facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still fairly easy to mix up a large
amount of nutrients, pH it, feed it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's reliable and it's consistent and it
is a great start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a good way to mix up a batch of
nutrients and start learning your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you wanna sway away from that
and go organic in the future, you've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: good foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've learned about the plants,
you've learned about growing, and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: can learn how to make your own stuff and
make the switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the cons of growing with
bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to pay money to ship them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to dispose of a bunch of bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the shitty things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you gonna put them?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't live in a legal state where
you can grow, you have to hide those
[SPEAKER_02]: bottles when you throw them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can see your advanced nutrients big
bud or you're gonna get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, look out for MAP and DAP if you're
growing synthetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like that will cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to flush with both.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think you don't have to flush if
you're growing organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're growing no-till,
you're going to need some flush time or it
[SPEAKER_02]: will affect the way your final product
burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean out that excess silicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean out that excess whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that excess nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your plants burn and taste a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap up the friendly debate about
organics versus synthetics by saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like bottle nutrients is a great
way to start if you're a new grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start off with the bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a good relationship with the plants,
with the rhythms of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a few grows under your belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to spot males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to take clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to lollipop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to crack the stems to make more
productive plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to trellis things down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn canopy control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get stuff like that dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Become a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you start understanding the
plants, once you start being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify deficiencies and learning things
to do to increase your yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: start finding ways to dial back the
bottles and replace those bottles with
[SPEAKER_02]: some organics and make the switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Graduate from bottles into organics and
become a black belt that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't forget when the end of the world
comes, you guys, you're only going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottles that you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you run out, those will be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to learn how to do it
like all the farmers do, just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now let's stop bickering with
each other over organics, over synthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have their place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have their purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can grow the way that they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all cannabis soldiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's quit arguing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's quit bickering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's raise each other up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bringing ourselves out of the dark
ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to hide anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to be weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to be sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually an industry now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to be assholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to act like we're artists
doing some secretive shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can all learn as much as I know
about cannabis just by reading and
[SPEAKER_02]: studying and doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all you have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's not be dicks to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not act like we're all the Wizard of
Oz or something because we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature was doing it long before you got
involved, and nature had it fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: mastered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just facilitating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just giving it a little place to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're kind of getting in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stop acting like you're a Jedi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop acting like you're a ninja.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all just pot growers playing with
some plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all one now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The no-till guys, the bottle guys,
the commercial guys, the closet guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: the seed breeders, the pollen chuckers,
the guys that kill plants, the brown
[SPEAKER_02]: thumbs, the green thumbs, the guys that
can't figure out how to water clones to
[SPEAKER_02]: save their lives, the guys that can't cure
bud to save their lives, the guys that
[SPEAKER_02]: cure bud like a Jedi, the guys that cut
clones just by looking at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all equal because we're all cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all coming out of the dark ages
to the green ages together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's be equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more bitching.

screaming tangerine dab put me on a rant.
