episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some great emails planned out for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to give away free seas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetic seeds on this episode hang
out We'll talk more about the free seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the show I do want to remind you
that team I read genetics will be at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude grows cup June 3rd in the Port
Colorado Look forward to seeing you there
[SPEAKER_00]: come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there Mike will be there The

[SPEAKER_00]: comm All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've covered all of the
business part of the podcast Let's move
[SPEAKER_00]: into everybody's favorite portion of the
show That is the question and answer part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the podcast this question came from the
grow help tab on the irie genetics website
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website irie genetics comm
on the top There's a row of tabs one will
[SPEAKER_00]: say grow questions or grow help click on
that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do ask you a question We do a few
preliminary questions and then we let you
[SPEAKER_00]: type in what the problem is in your grow
This message came from my buddy Dave G
[SPEAKER_00]: from Ontario big shout out to my buddy
Dave G from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Dave Please send me your address
because I do owe you a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because I read your letter here on the
show This one goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Dave from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a minute since I've heard from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope all is well up there It says happy
belated birthday my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the birthday was in March I'm reading
this a little bit after that, but thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the great birthday wishes I do
appreciate that the birthday was
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more it says you may remember me
I sent a few emails about a year ago Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I definitely remember you your name
stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a couple of which have appeared on
the podcast I was growing Raphael and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, great work, but I do remember you
totally recall you It says we share the
[SPEAKER_00]: same birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, bro It says we're both
comedy nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge comedy nerd Comedy is one of my
favorite things one of my favorite ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend an evening is to go See a live
comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says we both acquired brain injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes We may have some new viewers new
listeners new followers here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast in 2015 I suffered a major
traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It messed me up so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do math I missed a bunch of
appointments and people were calling me
[SPEAKER_00]: saying hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was saying I don't even know who you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you calling me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really messed me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in 2015 There were a few months
there where I was not myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long year of recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still weird Glitches ticks and
problems that arise from that brain injury
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally, but I mostly recovered from
that I'm sure it messed up my personality
[SPEAKER_00]: my memory Right after my brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't give a shit anymore There were
things I should care about but I just
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped giving a shit about a lot of
things after my brain injury So anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: just to bring some old listeners up or
some new listeners up to speed in 2015 I
[SPEAKER_00]: did experience a major traumatic brain
injury that uh, it caused me some big
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had visual problems memory problems I
was hallucinating a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying weird shit And eventually the
swelling in my brain healed up and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: much better now But sometimes you guys
that's why I'm fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why I'm fucking weird I was
already a little bit goofy before the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury the brain injury just kind of
amplified that weirdness Let me stay
[SPEAKER_00]: focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the lack of focus is from the brain
injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going It says we both love
cannabis cannabis at a maximum level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is absolutely true I am
completely in love and Infatuated and
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about this ganja plant that we
all love here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got so many great uses I smoke it for
Medical and recreational purposes
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I always say my first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a medical dab that second dab
That's that's kind of a supplementary dab
[SPEAKER_00]: that third dab that one's all recreational
the first to cure all the problems The
[SPEAKER_00]: third one is just to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a recreational and a medical
cannabis consumer I not only love the
[SPEAKER_00]: relief and The fun that it gives me but I
love seeing other people smoke cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and feel better I was part of the first
dispensary in my life neighborhood the
[SPEAKER_00]: first dispensary in my city and I got to
see all walks of life come through that
[SPEAKER_00]: shop young dudes old ladies and everything
in between and I would see people come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would say hey, I'm suffering from
this condition and I would develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with them and Recommend
cannabis products if it was smokeables
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, whatever topicals We'd get them
going in a few weeks when we figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: the right products for them They would
come back and I could see an improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: in the quality of their life And that is
amazing that this plant can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can improve the quality of our lives
Then we've got the social aspect who
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't like to hang out and smoke with a
bro or a lady or both or whatever Smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: with people is one of my favorite
experiences And then I also love the
[SPEAKER_00]: creative aspect of this ganja plant when I
smoke I'm a musician When I smoke I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go play music music sounds better food
tastes better life is just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better with this ganja plant and I love
how multifaceted this plant is and how
[SPEAKER_00]: many great positive Benefits we get from
the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are absolutely correct with the
idea that we both love Cannabis I can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: that you love cannabis as much as I do
because you've been around for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: You've sent a lot of messages and we have
interacted a bit and it's been over a year
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that you are definitely
committed to this ganja plant now,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said before I do have that brain
injury So I get a little bit rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this message It says are
you and I the same person on different
[SPEAKER_00]: planes of existence?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some interesting coincidences
Anyway, that is really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe in parallel universes and I
do believe in weird things like that So
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe somewhere along the line bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some of the same timeline
programmed into us Maybe the matrix spit
[SPEAKER_00]: us out at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever human printer you believe in
Maybe we came from the same human printing
[SPEAKER_00]: factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know bro, but I love that We're
such good friends and we don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we just become best friends,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this it says cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember me no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, bro, I remember you How would I
not remember my best friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm back and growing some fluff
head which I acquired from the dudes world
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to dudes world check Out the
dudes world if you need some irie genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: beans if they're in Canada big up,
dude I hope you're doing well,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's more it says I'm running
three plants and noticing some differences
[SPEAKER_00]: and Similarities that's a good thing to
observe then it says I have a question
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding powdery mildew and its
resistance This is where the spark gets
[SPEAKER_00]: fun now it goes on it says is powdery
mildew resistance a phenotypical trait
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that two plants from the same
population can possibly display different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of resistance the quick answer to
that Is yes, that is a phenotypical trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like one of those plants may smell
more like one thing The other one may
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like another thing that is
absolutely a phenotypical trait So you
[SPEAKER_00]: could put both of those plants on the same
room We could introduce powdery mildew on
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose and you'll see one may decimate
one plant and one may not touch the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant That is absolutely a phenotypical
trait now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does give an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said I've got fluff head Could my fluff
head number one and fluff head number two
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same PM resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: No They're it's very likely very possible
that they will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are bred from two vastly different
parents We've got the afterglow which
[SPEAKER_00]: grows kind of tall and skinny and it's got
those long thin tropical leaves And then
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got the chem four which grows
differently than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shorter squatty or bigger leaves
Totally different flavor profiles and
[SPEAKER_00]: since we've started with two vastly
different ingredients We can expect vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different outcomes in some of those
phenotypes Some of them may be completely
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistant and some of them
may be susceptible to powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance I do Know that the afterglow is
generally resistant to the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: but compared to other phenotypes you are
going to see Differences in that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says hopefully I worded that
well for you I'll be back with more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, especially now that you're
giving out seeds for the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right guys I'm not sure if I
mentioned this but if you send me a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question on the grow help tab at
iregenetics.com And I read that question
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the show you win a free pack of
iregenetic seeds So my buddy Dave up there
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ontario has won himself a free Pack of
seeds Dave you worded this perfectly bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand the question You're
basically one and this goes for every
[SPEAKER_00]: strain We highlighted fluff head here in
this question because that's what my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing But this goes with every strain
now do keep in mind that many strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistant If they're bred
in areas where powdery mildew is common
[SPEAKER_00]: over several generations Those plants will
build that powdery mildew resistance that
[SPEAKER_00]: just naturally will be in there A lot of
plants do have that some plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other hand just are naturally susceptible
to the powdery Mildew now within those two
[SPEAKER_00]: categories we're going to see the plants
that really get it and the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get it That's just a phenotypical
trait or an expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let me make sure I wrapped all
this up Thanks for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has helped me out on my journey,
bro That is what the whole point of this
[SPEAKER_00]: is to get everybody on a great cannabis
journey growing can be very frustrating
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of trials and tribulations
that come along with cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of bullshit information out
there I'm trying to get everybody on a
[SPEAKER_00]: good path and growing the best possible
cannabis they can grow and Enjoying it
[SPEAKER_00]: while they do it because we can all grow
good weed and struggle at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to make it easy for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last line is my favorite It says you
are my cannabis hero sincerely from Dave,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro I didn't know that I was anybody's
hero, but that does mean a lot to me much
[SPEAKER_00]: respect big fist brought bro Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay cool up there in Canada and send me
more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave also send me your address I think I
may have it already, but please do refresh
[SPEAKER_00]: my memory because we talked about that
brain injury, bro You know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get you a pack Of seeds up
there in Canada land.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've got a good flow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to take a break Now,
let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another question here in front of
me This one also came from the grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: tab on the irie genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our buddy philabong I
like that name a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up philabong you philabong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll rip a bong All right, the question
goes first of all, I love your podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro That is a great compliment
and a good way to start a message that
[SPEAKER_00]: says they are extremely helpful and you
are a great person for sharing your
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge I appreciate that I know that
it's kindness and all that stuff that does
[SPEAKER_00]: it but also there's some weird thing
inside of me that I feel like I would
[SPEAKER_00]: explode if I didn't share my knowledge and
kind of help you guys in this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given the gift of being able to
Receive information and also filter out
[SPEAKER_00]: the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my big gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can receive information I can read I can
research and I can hear a bunch of things
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I can put that into a small
package and Redeliver it in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody can understand it that way you
guys don't have to stay up till 6 In the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning reading the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did that for you and I'll come
put that out for you I feel like I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: compelled by I don't know what you believe
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me rasta Jeff I wear red golden
green colors all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in that's not important Whatever
you believe in that compels me to share
[SPEAKER_00]: this message with you That just and if I
didn't share that message, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: disrespectful to whatever gave me this
gift in this energy So thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for mentioning that I share this
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does go on there's actually content
to the message that says I've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of years and A 4x4 tent and I
have been searching for some prime females
[SPEAKER_00]: And I now have a few so far including
lemon Jeffrey and an orangegasm that is
[SPEAKER_00]: very promising at this point Alright,
so we're grown in a 4x4.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been searching for some stuff and
you've got a lemon Jeff and an orangegasm
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm glad you found those those
are great lines are gonna do very well for
[SPEAKER_00]: you It also says I've always wanted to
create my own strains since I started
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking 28 years ago, bro We're on the
same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're og veteran smokers and also I
understand that feeling Of wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: create strains something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just know you're like I could breed
something and then it's in you So you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it on Anyway, it says I found a
male that I have been keeping for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really like and I'm going to do a
pollen run in the next month after I
[SPEAKER_00]: finish up this flower run Sounds like a
good strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This male has a structure I want and the
smell is exactly what I want I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect as much pollen as I can and hold
on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good strategy I don't collect
pollen most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly just do live plant pollination
plant Porn if you will but your collection
[SPEAKER_00]: idea will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says at what point in flower should I
pollinate the females for best results?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it won't be the same time for every
female and plant but a general idea is all
[SPEAKER_00]: I need and I can play with it from there
Thank you for all you do from the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace from philabong big shout out to my
buddy philabong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question I don't remember
if I've said this or not, but philabong
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your real name and your
shipping address so that I can get you a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of iri genetic seeds Of course
that seed giveaway is sponsored by iri
[SPEAKER_00]: direct comm make sure you go check out iri
direct for all the recent restocks and
[SPEAKER_00]: drops But now let's answer this question
about pollination timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really good question So the
parts on the plant that we like to call
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs a lot of growers call them hairs
Those are pistols the little dandelion
[SPEAKER_00]: parts That is the part of your plant which
will receive the pollen the pollen will
[SPEAKER_00]: hit that little That little hair that's
sticking up the pollen will travel down
[SPEAKER_00]: that hair and inside once it gets down to
the bottom there It'll hit the ovule
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the bract and that is where the
seed Will begin to form now you are right
[SPEAKER_00]: with the idea that not every plant and
phenotype is going to be ready for pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time But it is generally
between days 18 to 23 ish all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: to about day 32 ish depending on the plant
I often talk about my strawberry fields
[SPEAKER_00]: and my platinum tangy plants because they
want pollen at very different times The
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum tangy plant that I breed with is
ready for pollen Approximately seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: ten days before that strawberry fields
plant So it's ideal for me to stagger
[SPEAKER_00]: those two plants when I put them in the
room So I can get them at their peak
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination times at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't go in the same time So I'll put
that strawberry fields plant in there on
[SPEAKER_00]: one day and then I'll wait about a week or
ten days Then I'll drag that platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy plant in there now They're both in
flower and they will both be ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen at the exact same time Now what you
are looking for my friend as a new breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pistols will receive pollen as soon
as they begin to form But what I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: is watching that plant and learning that
plant you should be breeding with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant you have grown Several times you've
got a few great cuts in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be watching these plants get an
idea When do those pistols look the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest the fluffiest the most available
when are there the most of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by looking the pistols are
gonna start off by popping out of the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're gonna get longer Then they're
gonna get thicker when they are at their
[SPEAKER_00]: longest and thickest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is peak pollination time Those are
the plants pollen receiving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of peas in one sentence
there But those that is peak pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: time when those pistols are nice and ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to look at the plant There is
no perfect day for pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a nice window There's a nice
time frame of when these plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: receive pollen They'll receive pollen
probably all the way up from about day 17
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up into like day 35 or 40
maybe even later They're able to receive
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen if there are pistols available They
can probably receive pollen eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: those pistols dry up and wither up and
they can no longer take it But as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got pistols on there, you can
pollinate them What you've got to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder is pay attention to those
female plants and see when you've got The
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum amount of pistols healthy viable
pistols available Another thing I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend is don't touch those pistols If
you plan on pollinating a plant don't
[SPEAKER_00]: touch those pistols if it's with your
hands with your shirt with anything Try
[SPEAKER_00]: not to touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them healthy and viable and active
also I don't like to spray plants that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pollinate I feel like those
sprays can disrupt those pistols and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want as many as I can have now I know you
would like a closer number a more accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: a more precise number of when to pollinate
these plants I'm going to say Sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: between day 25 and day 32 is usually the
best time you've got about a week window
[SPEAKER_00]: there That is usually peak pollination
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what happens if you pollinate too
early You don't get as many seeds as you
[SPEAKER_00]: could have you could have gotten more
seeds Here's what happens if you pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: too late You don't get as many seeds as
you could have if you pollinate right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right time You get the maximum amount
of perfect beautiful ripe seeds if you
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate too early You're just not gonna
get as many if you're making these seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself That will not be a problem if
you pollinate too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be a problem If you're making
seeds for yourself, if it's your first run
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the plant in there and
whenever it's got enough pistols you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate it or you can put two plants in
at the same time and they will pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: on the right time and you will make plenty
of seeds to play with it's that second
[SPEAKER_00]: third and fourth run is when you're gonna
want to learn how to dial things in and
[SPEAKER_00]: time it more perfectly so that you can get
the maximum amount of seeds I breed for
[SPEAKER_00]: production people are buying my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the maximum amount of seeds That's
why I drag plants in at different times
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really get the timing nailed down if
you can't Do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a plant in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put another plant in a room put some
pollen on those bitches and make some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds It's not as technical or hyper
critical as we would like it to be this
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in nature outdoors with no control
nature Just does it and it fucking works
[SPEAKER_00]: every year on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't stress too much Don't be too
hyper critical about the timing fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: love with the process of breeding Watch
when those pistols are ripe watch when
[SPEAKER_00]: that male plant starts dumping his pollen
Make documents make notes of both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants look really ready for pollen
about day two Day 23 about day 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of started looking withered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably pollinate around day 24
Make a note of when your male plant really
[SPEAKER_00]: make a note of when he starts dropping
pollen day 14 He started putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen day 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was dumping by day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't walk by him without pollen
flying everywhere Then at day 45 he quit
[SPEAKER_00]: making pollen document that shit Then do
the math equation in the future and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I need pollen at this time I need
fucking female plants will be ready at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time do the math and get them in the
room at the same time And get them going
[SPEAKER_00]: but honestly, like I said a moment ago
It's not hyper critical if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols and you've got pollen you will get
seeds my dude All right, my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: philabong.

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so send me your real name,
please I'd love to get you a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I've got another great question
here in front of me This one also did come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grow help tab on irie genetics
comm which means My friend Scott has won a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds Scott, you know the
drill my dude Please send me your real
[SPEAKER_00]: name and your address so that I can send
you a free pack of irie genetic seeds This
[SPEAKER_00]: one again came from our buddy Scott He has
a general grow question and it says I run
[SPEAKER_00]: a six to light schedule during veg and 12
12 during flower Okay, so these got the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on for six hours on and two hours
off It sounds like during veg which sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: wonky, but I understand why that works I
already know people are gonna be triggered
[SPEAKER_00]: by that six hours on and two hour off
light schedule during Veg, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: say why don't the plants go into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that two-hour dark frame is just
enough to let the plants go to sleep And
[SPEAKER_00]: then he wakes them up right before they're
actually in the sleep mode where it would
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger them to go to flower I understand
that then 12 12 like normal and flower the
[SPEAKER_00]: question here is could I do something like
6 2 6 12 during flower 6 on 2 off 6 on 12
[SPEAKER_00]: off I Understand the question my main
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote this on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says why why would you try to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to do that that two-hour off period
is basically making your plants hungry for
[SPEAKER_00]: light That is two hours that they could
have gotten photons Photon energy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the room and they could have done
that much more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 60 days That's a hundred and
twenty hours of photons which you are
[SPEAKER_00]: neglecting to give these plants which they
could have gotten think about it this way
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are a Gym rat let's just say you're
going to the gym and you're trying to work
[SPEAKER_00]: out I'm working out two more hours a day
than you Every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of this 60-day cycle I've
got a hundred and twenty more reps or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call them under my
belt My plants are gonna be stronger My
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are gonna be bigger batter more
robust because they've gotten more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion and my experience So if
you're doing six to in veg and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going into flower six to Six is definitely
not gonna work for a flower cycle You're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that basically and it's I don't I
don't think that that would work For a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle and I don't I don't get
why you want to do that So I guess I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a follow-up question my dude If you
really want to do this, please explain to
[SPEAKER_00]: me why why do you need to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the method to your madness?
[SPEAKER_00]: But my quick answer is why why are we
reinventing the wheel in this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do understand that I've introduced
the 18 six light cycle at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower but I can Give you a very rational
and well spoken and well thought out
[SPEAKER_00]: reason as to why I'm doing that I don't
see a rhyme or a reason for this new
[SPEAKER_00]: technique Unless maybe the room is getting
too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to save some electricity,
but there are other ways to work on that
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy My first answer my dude is why
and then I want some follow-ups I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know why you're gonna do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why that's straight up it why what you
thinking bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it, but you still get a
free pack of seeds So, please do send me
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said a real name and a shipping
address Alright, I've got one more
[SPEAKER_00]: question here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna bang this one out right here
at the end of the episode This is a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: one also came from the irie director I
read genetics website the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from monsoon city big up to
my dude monsoon city It says quick
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some rhombus freebies a while back
are those fems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I only see fem rhombus on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhombus is a feminized line I have not
made that in regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I will make reg seeds of the
rhombus It's possible, but I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any plans for that at this current time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are feminized seeds The website
is quite accurate at this time I think if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something missing on the website
that you would like to see if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, please let me know I'm working on
updating the website It's mostly me that
[SPEAKER_00]: does I've got a web guy that does this
stuff But I've got to create the content
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll send it to him But if
something's wonky or wrong, please let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know I will correct it but my dude monsoon
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are feminized seeds.
