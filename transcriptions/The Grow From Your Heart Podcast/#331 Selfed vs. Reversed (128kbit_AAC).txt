cannabis news education and conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower if you're a
professional grower If you're a new smoker
[SPEAKER_00]: or a dedicated dabber if you're a cannabis
activist or even someone who is just
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about the current state of
cannabis This my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff I want to
thank you guys again for joining me This
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of the podcast is brought to you
by my friends at the hella dank seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company if you need new genetics for your
garden I highly recommend the hella dank
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company You can find them at dank
seed dot store ladies and gentlemen Roll
[SPEAKER_00]: up a fat joint pack up the bong or start
heating up that dab rig because it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: for another episode of the grow from your
heart podcast Yo, what's up internet world
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time for episode 331 of the grow from
your heart podcast Thanks again for
[SPEAKER_00]: joining me This episode of the podcast is
brought to you by my friends at the hella
[SPEAKER_00]: dank seed company if you need new regular
or feminized seeds for your garden I
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommend the hella dank seed
company and you can find them at dank seed
[SPEAKER_00]: dot store You guys know I like to start
these episodes off by letting you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking on today I've been taking
dabs of this soul cleanser full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract from our friends at green dot labs
It is kush cleaner and chem four together
[SPEAKER_00]: and they describe it as a lemon lime sport
drink when decks and chem dog gas flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the lemon lime sport drink was
very very dominant in the flavor then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you exhale There's a hint of that windex
and I know that sounds crazy But it tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: and had a little aroma of windex and then
the after flavor is Definitely that chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog gas with a little bit of the lemon
lime sport drink just chill in there So
[SPEAKER_00]: very well described that's the soul
cleanser from our friends at green dot
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also After that I took a big dab of some
cherry diesel live resin and that seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: to put me in a really Rambly talkative
mood that cherry diesel was super smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: and had a candy flavor to it and really
made my head Spin, so the combo has got me
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a great podcast All right
before we move forward into the main topic
[SPEAKER_00]: of the podcast I would like to read a
couple of emails this first email comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from a listener who calls himself Marco
Esquandolas And the email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your great show It pains me
to hear you recommend Hobby Lobby as a
[SPEAKER_00]: place to buy supplies Hobby Lobby is a
politically active right-wing organization
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying for the continuation of the war
on drugs You're giving your money to a
[SPEAKER_00]: corporation who Would like to see you your
friends and your family rotting in jail
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of your lives Now what this
email is referring to is in the trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned picking up your scissors at
Hobby Lobby This guy is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not be shopping at Hobby Lobby
Thanks for waking me up to that The reason
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Hobby Lobby is because not
everybody has access to a grow store not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody can just drive right up to grow
generation or One love garden supply or
[SPEAKER_00]: grow warehouse or way to grow not
everybody could just zip right over there
[SPEAKER_00]: And shop around and get the best deal on
scissors I blurted out Hobby Lobby because
[SPEAKER_00]: that was my backup plan when I didn't have
a grow store around here Most places have
[SPEAKER_00]: a Hobby Lobby Also, some people aren't
comfortable going to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be seen at the hydroponic store
They can't be seen parked out front there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be seen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have to be a little more careful
They can go to Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be going to Hobby Lobby already
They can just cruise over and pick up a
[SPEAKER_00]: pair of those scissors, but you are
correct We should not be shopping at Hobby
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobby if they are continuing to
participate and support the war on drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want anything to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stop giving them our money Here's
what I like about this email our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco Escondola's offers suggestions and
other opportunities He presents a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: offers a suggestion on how to solve that
problem He says instead I suggest sending
[SPEAKER_00]: your listeners to either their local grow
shop or a shop that supports our community
[SPEAKER_00]: like build a soil Then he adds I just got
titanium bladed scissors for eight dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: and forty cents on sale at build a soil So
you guys that is a great option Let's try
[SPEAKER_00]: to skip Hobby Lobby if we can I should not
have said that I should not have
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended that Let's skip the Hobby
Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to go somewhere that supports
our community better First off,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's try to shop at a local grow store
that supports our community If you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, then maybe find a craft store
that is locally owned Maybe you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: craft store owned by a little old lady and
her daughter runs it maybe give them your
[SPEAKER_00]: money But try to put your money back into
your community and not somewhere that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to support the war on drugs If all
else fails, that's when you go to Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends sent us an email Saying that
it's probably cheaper to shop at the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store, which yes, that is probably true
But not everybody has a grow store and not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody can go to the grow store So some
folks are gonna need a backup plan Some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks are gonna need a way to get their
supplies Discreetly if you can't go to
[SPEAKER_00]: your local grow shop and you can't find a
store that supports your community locally
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you turn to Amazon But if the
products are available locally and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: competitively priced and you don't put
yourself in any Jeopardy by going to a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow store, please shop at your local grow
store grow store that supports our
[SPEAKER_00]: community If you've got a chain store or
you've got a mom and pop store try to
[SPEAKER_00]: support that mom and pop store Let's try
to spend our money wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to support people instead of
businesses So I owe a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Marco Esquandola's dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show Thank
you for waking me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for reminding us that Hobby
Lobby is not on our team and thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: the great email, dude I do appreciate it
Rye Rye Rocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys have got one more
email and then we're gonna get to the main
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the podcast This email goes like
this it says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am new to the industry I've worked for
the Department of Defense for 14 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was against all things cannabis until
recently I really just want to say thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you I listen to your podcast and the DGC
podcast and you all have turned me on to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as medicine and I Wholeheartedly
believe in it Wow Here's the part where I
[SPEAKER_00]: wish I had some sort of audience applause
sound effects to insert because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: great this person worked for the
Department Of Defense for 14 years and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were against all things cannabis but
with the help of the dude grows crew and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself we were able to convince this
person that cannabis is Medicine and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they wholeheartedly believe in cannabis as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have flipped this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They agree with us now Let's continue with
the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am currently looking to get away
from the enemy and they say the government
[SPEAKER_00]: Babylon and into the medical cannabis
industry Now that it's legal in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to make a life of Helping people
heal and feel better about life and
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves I use and have used for about a
year now as my health is not what it once
[SPEAKER_00]: was I've seen my dad pass away from cancer
Due to Agent Orange and I wish he had
[SPEAKER_00]: access to cannabis My mother is currently
battling breast cancer and has used
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to keep her weight up as well as
myself battling Melanoma and currently
[SPEAKER_00]: using for anxiety and stress relief Thank
you for giving me good material to listen
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn from as well as just making my
morning commute better I fully believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and now that I have been born
again to the great things it can do I will
[SPEAKER_00]: never turn my back on it I will advocate
for it and just want to say thank you from
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you You guys these messages like
this are Overwhelming to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I do the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I want to dance around I'm
not sure if I want to cry a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a huge smile and I feel a little
bit numb These messages make all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: effort worth it These messages make every
frustrating minute behind this microphone
[SPEAKER_00]: These messages make every second of
writing this podcast These messages make
[SPEAKER_00]: the couple hours that I miss doing other
things with my friends Sometimes I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: skip out on shit because I have to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro You want to go down and do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna record a podcast and all my
friends go have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here recording These messages make
everything I've missed worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These messages make every night I've
stayed up late to edit a show Worth it
[SPEAKER_00]: messages like this are why I have a
podcast messages like this are what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: here for This is why we have a cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a friend who was part of the
Department of Defense and was against
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now they are Dedicating their lives
to helping other people Learn how to use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to better their lives to improve
their well-being to enjoy their life
[SPEAKER_00]: better This person has done a 180 they
were on the other team now they are Fully
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what our podcasts are doing you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what our advocating is doing This
is what standing up and speaking up for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves and speaking out for ourselves
has done We are able to help more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are convincing more people that this is
a medicine So this person wrote this email
[SPEAKER_00]: to say thank you and I appreciate the
thanks But thank you because this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best compliment that I could have received
This is the best email I could have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: all week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This made my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This made my week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you I truly appreciate this Now I
also want to say I'm sorry that you lost
[SPEAKER_00]: your dad to cancer from Agent Orange That
is terrible, but I am proud of you for
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to help your mom with her
breast cancer I hope that helps her keep
[SPEAKER_00]: her weight up and also I hope you say that
you're using cannabis to fight your
[SPEAKER_00]: melanoma and using it for anxiety and
stress relief Perfect uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that continues to work for you
people often forget that our mental health
[SPEAKER_00]: is just as important as our physical
health and Sometimes that little mind
[SPEAKER_00]: escape that cannabis brings you can be a
helpful Healthy thing you forget that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sick You forget that you're in pain
and you're able to relax and enjoy your
[SPEAKER_00]: life for a little bit and that's what it's
all about Enjoying life improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you Thanks for joining our
team and thank you for thanking me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this feeling is mutual we agree So

hear your story I would love to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: input if you'd like To share your story
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it Alright guys,
I've been going for just over 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't taken a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't taken a dab I'm going to press
pause for a quick second probably play
[SPEAKER_00]: some music for you I'm gonna take a couple
of dabs all that music plays and when we
[SPEAKER_00]: come back We're going to talk about the
difference between r1 and s1 labeling on
[SPEAKER_00]: seed packages
[SPEAKER_00]: All right podcast world I am back remember
those dabs I was telling you about They
[SPEAKER_00]: worked they are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well hydrated I'm well medicated and I
am back to talk about podcasting before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get into the main topic I've got one more
thing I'd like to remind you about and
[SPEAKER_00]: that one thing is Patreon if you feel like
this podcast was educational entertaining
[SPEAKER_00]: or informative and you'd like to
contribute financially to the show you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do so by going to www.patreon.com slash
grow from your heart all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you need will be right
there you guys I offer several different
[SPEAKER_00]: gifts or rewards for my patreon
contributors that's the quickest way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get your email read on a show or the
quickest way to get a shout out from me
[SPEAKER_00]: but I also offer things like a 30 minute
one-on-one consultation through FaceTime
[SPEAKER_00]: or Skype we can look at your grow room you
can bring your plant right up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera you can show me what's going on
with your plants and we can diagnose a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem if you've got a problem or we can
walk through your grow room if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone and we can just look at your
grow and figure out what's going on we can
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to improve your grow or if
you've got any weird growing questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't feel like you can we can
answer through emails or whatever you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get personal consultations the way to do
that is through the patreon campaign and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to find the patreon page is www
.patreon.com slash grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: all right enough of that let's talk about
feminized seeds and a feminized seed
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling if you guys pay attention to the
show or if you pay attention to I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics you know that I am making golden
goat feminized seeds and more lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey feminized seeds the golden goat
will be straight golden goat I took a
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat female and turned it into a
male I used that male golden goat pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: and put that to a golden goat female which
will make seeds it will only have female
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes because there was no male
involved I reversed a female it will only
[SPEAKER_00]: have female chromosomes and it will only
have golden goat genetics so those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: will be golden goat s1s now in the same
project I am making lemon Jeffrey lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey is a lemon skunk female pollinated
by that reversed golden goat male so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's golden goat pollen with no male
chromosomes applied to a lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: female that will produce feminized lemon
Jeffrey r1 seeds now before I get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: r1 and s1 let's quickly talk about regular
non-feminized seed breeding labels if I
[SPEAKER_00]: were to breed something non-feminized
we'll use a rise as an example a rise is a
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat female to a daybreaker male
you would put in parentheses golden goat X
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker in parentheses that's golden
goat to daybreaker that would make a rise
[SPEAKER_00]: f1 f1 indicates first filial generation
which means it's the first time that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain has been crossed if I take that
strain and find a male and a female and
[SPEAKER_00]: breed them together what comes out of that
will be the f2 and so forth so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the f comes in in regular seed
breeding when you're breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds that's when the f is
replaced with ours or s's now let's talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the r's and s's let's start with s
first if you see a seed package and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled golden goat s1 that indicates that
those seeds came from a reversed golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat female that was turned into a male
that pollen was used on another golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat plant and it is itself the letter s
indicates that it is itself and no other
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics were introduced into that cross
now a good reason for doing that is to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve genetics let's say that I get
tired of growing golden goat or something
[SPEAKER_00]: goes wrong and I can't have golden goat
anymore or let's say maybe there's a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: or a flood and my golden goat plant gets
destroyed I have got s1 seeds of golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat to keep it in preservation the seeds
that I release for golden goat are s1
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds because it is a female plant I do
not have a male there is no known male of
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat floating around so the only
way you could make more seeds of golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat would be to reverse it and make self
seeds out of it make s1 and that is good
[SPEAKER_00]: for self preservation it's also good to
get those genetics out to people in other
[SPEAKER_00]: places that don't have access to the
clones you can get the seeds out to people
[SPEAKER_00]: that way everybody's got the opportunity
to grow something similar very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat so s stands for self and that
is selfing a plant that is for self
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation and preserving genes it
doesn't adulterate those genes with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else if you were to cross the
golden goat to something else you've
[SPEAKER_00]: created a new cross say the daybreaker
then you could find a male that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: that golden goat and do that to the
original golden goat female and now you've
[SPEAKER_00]: created a back cross which is different
that's non-feminized and you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of variation you're gonna have to
work that but the feminized route the self
[SPEAKER_00]: route there is no adulteration no
introduction of new genes so it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to get exactly the golden goat you're
looking for so that is selfing selfing is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a plant and making seeds of itself
without adulterating its genetic makeup
[SPEAKER_00]: now that we understand selfing let's talk
about r r stands for reversal and r1 is a
[SPEAKER_00]: first generation of a reversal if i were
to take that feminized golden goat pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were talking about earlier and put
that on a different plant that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat now we have created what's
called a reversal and that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized and it will be a new cross lemon
jeffrey is an r1 that is feminized golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat pollen on a lemon skunk female and
that makes a brand new cross so that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal one it's an r1 is what you would
label that that would be your lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: jeffrey r1 let's talk more about an r1
what is the purpose of an r1 the purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: of an r1 is to create new and unique
feminized crosses i know a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are haters on femseeds but they are very
useful for people with limited plant
[SPEAKER_00]: counts and for people that can't risk
wasting time and space on having a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant so there is an application for them
i do not hate them i support them i make
[SPEAKER_00]: them myself so the short version of this
story would be if you reversed a plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: put the pollen on itself that is a self if
you reverse a plant and put that pollen on
[SPEAKER_00]: any other cultivar you have just created a
new reversal both of those the r1 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: s1 are both feminized now let's talk about
phenotype expectations from the two of
[SPEAKER_00]: those obviously if you're doing an s1 you
hope to find really close representations
[SPEAKER_00]: of your original female plant you're going
to see some traits of the parents of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant but it's going to be very close
representations of the original plant you
[SPEAKER_00]: start with some will lean towards the mom
some will lean toward the dad but most of
[SPEAKER_00]: those phenotypes that come from those
femseeds are going to look a lot like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original plant you started with now let's
talk about the phenotypes from reversals
[SPEAKER_00]: reversals show phenotypes a lot like
regular breeding you're going to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect 50-50 blend of the two parents you
start with you'll see some that look a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: like the female you started with you'll
see some that look a lot like the dad you
[SPEAKER_00]: started with you may get little indicators
of the grandparents reversals are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you different phenotypes a lot like
normal breeding but I think a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of variation is to be desired when you're
working with seeds that's why I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from seed if I wanted everything to
look exactly the same I would grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: clones so expect to see a little bit of
phenotypical variation if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: reversals if you're running selves out of
a six pack you will definitely find the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that looks just like the one on the
package or just like the one you saw on
[SPEAKER_00]: the website or just like the one that you
smoked some more that got you super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about it now you've got that cross
now you've got that specific phenotype and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow it for yourself all the time
make sure you take a clone oh please make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you take a clone all right you guys I
feel like I broke down the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between reversals and self seeds both are
feminized the main difference again is if
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that pollen from one plant and
applied it to itself or applied that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen to different plants self is s1
anything else becomes a reversal that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: r1 keep that in mind always keep in mind
when you're labeling genetic crosses that
[SPEAKER_00]: you list the female first ladies first all
the time so when you're listing genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: it should go female x male that's how you
list your crosses then you put the name
[SPEAKER_00]: right up above that so ladies first all
the time when you're listing genetics I
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of people cross that one up on
the internet and why does it matter
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a different cross golden goat
to daybreaker and daybreaker to golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat are two different crosses so that
does matter you should list it correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: all right you guys I want to give a couple
of really quick shout outs I want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge shout out to my friend Tyler a
shout out to Miles Porter and a huge shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Maddie E all right you guys before
I start wrapping up this show I've got one
[SPEAKER_00]: more thing I'd like to talk about I get a
lot of messages from people asking how do
[SPEAKER_00]: I get into this industry how do I get a
big grow started how do I move to Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I get a facility how do I get
licensed how do I get plants how do I set
[SPEAKER_00]: it up can you teach me to grow can you
help me do this the first step to that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys is to learn to grow some cannabis
don't buy a big facility don't get a
[SPEAKER_00]: big-ass license get a light get some seeds
learn how to germinate a 10-pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to run a crop from seed to
harvest learn how to identify males learn
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow the product before you even
think about a big facility master a small
[SPEAKER_00]: facility I see so many people that don't
know how to grow think they're just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: jump into it and master this you guys I've
been at this for a long time and I still
[SPEAKER_00]: experience crop problems I still get
spider mites occasionally I still see
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew the thing is I've
experienced it in small enough grows to
[SPEAKER_00]: where I know how to deal with it and I've
learned how to adjust that to larger grows
[SPEAKER_00]: when you walk in to your multi-million
dollar facility with 250 lights and you
[SPEAKER_00]: see spider mites in there you're going to
shit your pants because you've never dealt
[SPEAKER_00]: with it if you've dealt with it on a small
scale if you've had one pound of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: at risk if that was gonna be your loss
from those spider mites that's okay that's
[SPEAKER_00]: your one pound of extra money that you
were gonna make you may not get to have as
[SPEAKER_00]: much fun this summer that's cool when you
walk into that facility and you see 500
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds at risk from spider mites you're
gonna get anxious you're gonna sweat in
[SPEAKER_00]: places you didn't know you had sweat
glands it's gonna make you sick to your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking stomach you're not gonna be ready
for it you're gonna panic you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: more shit wrong to cause more problems
before you think about building a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse before you think about a ten
lighter before you think about six or four
[SPEAKER_00]: lights hang up a light learn how to grow
build a relationship with the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the cycles of the plant
understand what that plant needs
[SPEAKER_00]: understand your goal with the plant
understand why you're doing it before you
[SPEAKER_00]: go build yourself a giant facility and
invest all of your money and risk losing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything figure out if you can do this
and also don't become one of those owners
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just money hungry if you stop and
you build yourself a small grow and you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a few plants you'll build a
relationship with the plant not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: financial relationship you'll actually
have a connection it feels really good to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis you fall in love with your
garden you fall in love with your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and they make you feel good before you
even smoke them you get to feel rewarded
[SPEAKER_00]: because you watch them grow so you won't
be one of these money hungry owners you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually understand what's going on you'll
understand that when I tell you this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be 14 weeks until I harvest this
I've got veg I've got flour then we cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down a lot of owners will say 14 weeks huh
I'll be back in 12 weeks we'll cut it down
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say dude I said 14 and they go
yeah 11 weeks sounds great you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a minute I thought I thought you said
12 last time and the accountant goes yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 weeks will be perfect like that's how
that shit works so don't be that guy build
[SPEAKER_00]: a relationship with the plant understand
the cycles understand why the growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: being so meticulous with what they're
doing understand why the growers need your
[SPEAKER_00]: patience I really think that starting
small with one two maybe three lights at
[SPEAKER_00]: the most is the way to go I would
recommend you start off with a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light for flowering and a thousand
watt light for vegging and be able to run
[SPEAKER_00]: a perpetual cycle never have an
interruption every time you cut down a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop move more veg plants in every time
you cut down a crop move more veg plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in you should always have a cycle going
before you can master that don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: think about running a large facility so
you guys my point here is start small and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go big
[SPEAKER_00]: because I see a lot of people try to start
these big commercial production facility
[SPEAKER_00]: start learning commercial horticulture
practices now don't become a home grower
[SPEAKER_00]: don't become a basement grower don't
become a garage grower become a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator yes you may be doing it at home
but you can still have the mindset start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking what products am I allowed and
not allowed to use what is sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: what is non sustainable start thinking
about man hours start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity run your personal grow as if
it were a business if your plan is to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a business with your grow all right you
