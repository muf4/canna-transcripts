[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 833 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out, we'll talk more about those free
seeds later on in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of free seeds, I do want to
remind you that anybody who shows up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows Cup wearing an Irie
Genetics or Irie Army t-shirt will receive
[SPEAKER_00]: a free gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you stop by the booth,
show me that Irie Army merch, that Irie
[SPEAKER_00]: Army gear, and I will hook you up with a
free gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're not wearing merch,
if you're not wearing the gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to stop by the booth and say
hello, give me a high five, give me a fist
[SPEAKER_00]: bump, give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're into, come introduce
yourself, say hello at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, the Dude Grows Cup is
happening again this year in La Porte,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado on June 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows crew will be there,
Team Irie Genetics will be there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Irie Army will be there, and I invite
you to join us at the Dude Grows Cup in La
[SPEAKER_00]: Porte, Colorado on June 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of that information, check out
dgccup.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get you all the links and
details you need for the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to show up to the Dude Grows
Cup wearing Irie Genetics merch and get
[SPEAKER_00]: that free gift, all you have to do is go
to my website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top, there's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs says merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that merch tab, grab some merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you order it now, it will be delivered
on time for the Dude Grows Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can rock that gear at the Dude
Grows Cup and get yourself a free prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like we're making a lot
of great progress in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do also want to remind you that I have
restocked Irie Direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, my other website,
ireedirect.com, has been restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have reloaded the orangegasm,
the lemon jeffery, and the golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of this recording,
I also restocked the big mountain fudge
[SPEAKER_00]: cake femseeds, but they are moving very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you hit ireedirect.com for
orangegasm, lemon jeffery, and golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've gotten all the business
covered here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work our way into the pet peeve
section of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, sometimes when I go to a
commercial grow, maybe sometimes I'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: to a friend's grow or perhaps I'll just be
scrolling online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I see something in a grow room
or in a grow environment that's simply dry
[SPEAKER_00]: drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it even almost hurts my feelings
and makes me sad for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see just by looking, just by taking
a quick visual look, that there are simple
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we could do to improve this
grow in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small details could give you better
potency, better harvest weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just make the grow overall more
enjoyable for the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that stuff drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do encourage you, the listeners and the
viewers, to send me your grow room pet
[SPEAKER_00]: peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out and send them to me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your grow room pet peeve here on
the podcast, I will send you a coupon code
[SPEAKER_00]: for a free pack of seeds on ireadirect
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first pet peeve came from somebody
who calls themselves local kook and it
[SPEAKER_00]: says, my pet peeve is when a grower thinks
plant problems like deficiencies will be
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed the day that they are addressed and
watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a few days or more to see a
repair and CalMag is not always the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll see people post,
hey, I've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is wrong with my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say hypothetically that somebody
posts a photo of a plant with an obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would identify that nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would explain to them why I think it's
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that plant is way yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as green as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually a sign of nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would recommend a couple of ways to
correct that nitrogen problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, my first recommendation
to correct a nitrogen deficiency would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say grab your bottle of base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nitrogen based nutrient bottle
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake it up, mix up a foliar feed,
apply that to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is a mobile element, so the
plants are going to receive that and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will move it around as it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nitrogen will get distributed
throughout that plant as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will solve your nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would recommend is to
mix up a feed solution with that base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, which is heavily nitrogen based,
then water that into the plants as normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most people are probably going to do
one, maybe two of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to overdo both
of those things, but that's not the point
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is they're going to do that and
then they're going to look at the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to say, they're still
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, those plants are still yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to green up right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little bit of time
for the plants to metabolize the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: you just gave them, for them to move that
around, to make that nutrient mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the word of moving mobile
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a specific word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to move those nutrients around
where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over a course of time, you will see
improvement on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this viewer, this listener is
absolutely correct that many times when I
[SPEAKER_00]: make recommendations to people,
I go say, go spray that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: go foliar feed that plant with a nitrogen
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go spray it and they'll say,
still green, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go, well, yeah, the nutrients take a
little bit of time to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need a day cycle for that
metabolism to happen, a night cycle for
[SPEAKER_00]: corrections to be made, maybe another day
or two for things to balance themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a day, two, three,
maybe four or five days to see any results
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were doing any sort of
correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes to any kind of feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you feed a plant, unless you're in
cocoa or hydro, cocoa and hydro do show
[SPEAKER_00]: you quite quickly, but if you're in a
soilless mix or a soilless situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mix up a bottle nutrient, you feed
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, it's going to take two,
three, maybe four or five days to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: see results of that feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of processes have to happen unless
you went extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you weigh overfed, if you put something
in there that's way too hot, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: notice it the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your nutrient, if your pH is way off,
you might notice that quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, it's going to take
you two, three, four, maybe even five days
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify what's going on with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient when you're making
corrections on if it's a deficiency or an
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very patient waiting for changes to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just cause more problems by
being impatient, trying to do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identify that problem, find a solution,
create the solution, execute that
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, then sit back and let it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smoke a joint, go walk the dog,
leave those plants alone for a day or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention, but don't do more shit to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let them heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people cause more harm than
good by doing too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, that is a good, a good pet peeve
thinking that those problems are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be solved just by one quick foliar
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work, but it may take a little bit
of time for those nutrients to move around
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it can take a few days or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and CalMag is not always the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I'm on social media on somebody's
got a plant problem, the first answer is
[SPEAKER_00]: always CalMag, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not always the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a lot of times it is the
answer, but it is not always the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy, LocalCook,
thank you for the great pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got me rambling with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message was sent to me via YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was as a YouTube comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not have your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I just cut and paste the
email addresses from the messages to send
[SPEAKER_00]: you your free coupon code for free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, LocalCook, please do recheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: out so that I can get you a coupon code
for a free pack of seeds off of iredirect
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep the momentum going
and segue into the grow help portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about my website,
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that website, there is a list of tabs
up on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will ask you a few preliminary
questions and then we give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to send me a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a good grow question and I
read that question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds off of iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's question came from our friend,
Tice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Tice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo, Rasta Jeff, what a guan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope all is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, Bredrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything, I read and your part of
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are good over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a podcast and I'm stoned as
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have nothing to complain about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, I've been watching and
listening to the podcast for a little over
[SPEAKER_00]: three years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a good soul, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you drop knowledge for free and
you put TLC into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those are true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate what you do, boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate enough to purchase some of
the 90s skunk testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were quite limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I was wondering if it was
cool to sell or give a clone away,
[SPEAKER_00]: being that those are testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of the time when it comes to my
plants, my seeds, my creations,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in general, I have no problem
with people cutting clones and sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what you have got are tester
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be, and this goes for almost any
seed that you're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me kind of back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to give a clone away,
the person receiving that clone expects
[SPEAKER_00]: you to have ran that plant and tested it
and verified that it is worth their time
[SPEAKER_00]: and energy growing in that garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people want clones,
because they want something that they know
[SPEAKER_00]: is tried and true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it's female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it's not intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it doesn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they know it's going to grow well in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to flower in a reasonable time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have a desirable aroma and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to be desirable in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be desirable to smoke and
consume or make concentrates or edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you're going to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person giving out the clone is kind of
responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person receiving the clone is trusting
that giver to be responsible for vetting
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, if you've got the fems,
you've got six seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you've ran all of six of those seeds
and you've identified the winner out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower, as a grow community member,
as a ganja farmer, that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your due diligence to run those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stands for testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any seeds that you're working with,
it is your responsibility to run those
[SPEAKER_00]: before you give out a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the person getting that clone,
like I said, is trusting you and relying
[SPEAKER_00]: on you that that clone is, like I said,
going to flower in a reasonable time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have a good aroma and flavor
and it's going to be potent and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep an eye on these plants and don't
pass along any problematic plants to your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes for any seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any seed could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any seed could also be a gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any seed that you are running,
make sure you run that before you pass out
[SPEAKER_00]: a clone to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't just say this with tester
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just say this because this is my
new creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not trying to hoard this or
do any gatekeeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to give your friend a
problematic plant before you've even ran
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't want to give it to them
because it's not worth giving to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll give them problems or just
maybe, just maybe it's so freaking amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want it all for yourself and you
don't even want to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give it to them now and you
haven't even finished it, maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving out something that's going to set
you apart from the market that may have
[SPEAKER_00]: helped you out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to, what is it called,
encourage gatekeeping here, but that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that may happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't give away my favorite
plants because they're my favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what separates me as a grower,
as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes us stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run all those seeds, find what you
enjoy, find what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you know that those plants
are good, there's no problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: then consider giving a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I know when people see that word
skunk, they're going to want to clone
[SPEAKER_00]: already, but do them the favor and run it
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the pheno hunt for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe involve them in your
selection when it comes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to grow the six seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one of them will get cold early
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll run five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is not going to be the top one
that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got four to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring your friend over.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do the pheno selection,
when you're smoking these, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the smoke test and the sampling,
bring your buddy over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like clone number one,
and your buddy likes clone number two the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can easily give him that clone of that
mother plant, and then you both have the
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk that you desire, and you can both
grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have your differences and your
similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm rambling, and the point here is
not just with tester seeds, but with any
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, don't give out clones until you've
fully ran that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, as the clone
giver, people are trusting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trusting that you have ran this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've verified that it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flowers in a reasonable time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you a desirable aroma
and flavor, and a nice buzz, and anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that is required for your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're growing for
concentrates, edibles, topicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but does it fit the bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trusting you, and also they're
trusting you to give them a clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: does not have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bugs, no pathogens, definitely no hop,
latent viroid, definitely no russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relying on you to give them that
clean clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you provide all of those
services, hit all of those markers as
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody giving out a clone, and the
person receiving the clone also,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is also your responsibility to treat
that clone as if it has got every problem
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get that clone, treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat it multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to give it some isolation,
some quarantine away from population,
[SPEAKER_00]: that way if it does have spider mites,
russet mites, thrips, fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, put that clone in another area,
and then keep an eye on it daily,
[SPEAKER_00]: and treat it, and see if you see any bugs
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know that it's clean,
then you can put it in the general
[SPEAKER_00]: population with the rest of your plants,
but that is your responsibility as the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust all my bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to believe in all my friends,
but if anybody gives me a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: if my mama gave me a clone, I would still
treat that clone like it's got thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites, fungus gnats, hop,
latent viroid, and powdery mildew all over
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would leave it and honestly would sit
right here on this table for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days is where the new clones come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix up a spray solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray the shit out of them, and they sit
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't go into the grow space for
several days, and I look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay a lot of attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just quarantine, isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if there is a problem,
I can identify it and get rid of that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone, or I can treat it until that
problem's gone, then put it in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any clone that comes in, like I said,
if it's my mom, if it's Mike, if it's my
[SPEAKER_00]: best friend, if it's from any dispensary,
every clone that comes in, I am very
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect of that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my responsibility and my fault if
something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my buddy Tice, that was a long ramble,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your email address here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that you've got a coupon
code for a free pack of iReGenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: Premium Seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me wrap this up and make sure that we
got everything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if it's cool to give away a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not cool to give away a clone
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did reply to my friend Tice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, dude, at least wait until I
release that strain before you start
[SPEAKER_00]: giving out clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I've said in the past,
those are yours and you can honestly do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You paid for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sell you a car until you not to
drive fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But run them, grow them, be a good friend,
be a good grower, a good cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community member, then share those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep the party going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here
right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the Grow Help tab
on iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a friend who wants to
be called 420 Lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a general grow question that says,
yo Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been popping beans now for a
while, but for some reason I did not get a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut of this particular phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop myself right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always preach to cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you're growing from seed or you
get a clone from your buddy or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing something new, when you run it,
take a clone from it because you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know that could be the most amazing plant
that you have ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like our friend here, they're
realizing seven and a half weeks in this
[SPEAKER_00]: plan is going to be a boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they don't have a clone of it and
they're already starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only seven and a half weeks and we'll
read more, but they don't have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already are regretting not getting a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always say, take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't, there's another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says she's now seven and a half weeks
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take a cut from this plant,
will it root?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is absolutely yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a clone somewhere near the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a nice clone like you normally
would clip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dip it, stick it, clean it up quite a bit
at the top so there's not a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: extra foliage up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that clone will root.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation is to put that clone in
a turbo cloner, an easy cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: an auto cloner, some sort of aeroponic
cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed they root much more quickly
in that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they seem to revedge more quickly
in the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I was experimenting with some
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a plant, I did something similar,
but I did enough plants where I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have room to take as many clones as I was
running plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory was just that I was going to
revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I grew a plant,
I flowered it, I finished it, I harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left two buds on the bottom or two
branches on the bottom, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to revedge this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut one of those branches off and put it
in the easy cloner and I left that other
[SPEAKER_00]: branch just sticking off the pot just like
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess which one of those plants revedged
way more quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant in the easy cloner was stronger,
faster, more robust, and it revedged way
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend taking a cut and
putting it in an easy cloner if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant will root and revedge very
quickly in that easy cloner if you give it
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that may not be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18.6 will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours of light would really speed up
your revedge process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that clone, put it in that easy
cloner if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that under 24 hours of light in that
easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will revedge quite quickly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I keep saying the word revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not able to get that clone,
you can always revedge that flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I recommend doing it is when
you're going to harvest, there'll be a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of buds at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut off most of the plant,
leave three, maybe five thumb-sized buds
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got big thumbs, they don't even have to
be this big, but leave some thumbs with
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some leaves and stuff on those
plants because that is what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive the sun or the light and that's
what's going to tell that plant to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: the revedge process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chop the plant down, leave three to
five little tiny bottom buds at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant and revedge those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those should revedge quite quickly for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another tip that you can do, and I get a
lot of controversy when I talk about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: before you harvest, about seven to ten
days before harvest, you can put your
[SPEAKER_00]: lights back on and 18 hours on and six
hours off light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds wild to some people,
but what that's going to do is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give your plants more photon energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photons are the number one source of
energy for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that the last seven to ten days
of the flowering period, you will bulk up
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get beefier, they will get more
dense, and they may even finish a day or
[SPEAKER_00]: two sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also what that is going to do,
that is going to speed up your revedge
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say, Rasta Jeff,
if I put my plants on 18-6 in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, eventually they will revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to cut them down before that,
but you're going to leave a couple buds on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom that have now gotten a huge
head start on the revedge process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will begin revedging much sooner than
a plant that did not have 18-6 at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That revedge process, the buds are going
to look like shit for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will happen for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put it into the 18-6, you'll feed
it, give it some nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: After about two weeks, you'll see coming
out of the top of the buds just little
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots coming out, little leaves coming
out of the top of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those will start growing longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll make leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make curly twisted world leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually they'll start making
perfect little clones that look just like
[SPEAKER_00]: little plants coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend cloning those little shoots
and using those clones as your new mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use that revedged one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been through a little bit of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start fresh with those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quick answer, the question was,
can I take a clone at week 7.5?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quickest way to do that, it will
revedge more quickly in the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if that does not work for you,
just simply revedge the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I do recommend taking clones
from everything, because you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the next Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the next Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the next Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the next Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you might be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always take those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can hear my voice is burning
out and getting dry.
