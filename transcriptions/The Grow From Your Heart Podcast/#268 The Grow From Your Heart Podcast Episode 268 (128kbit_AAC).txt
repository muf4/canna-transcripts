[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic Root
[SPEAKER_00]: Band for letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's getting welcome to the show,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am dabbing on some Tahoe OG batter from
Apothecary, and it made me totally numb
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I haven't experienced in
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a big old fat dab and my whole body
went numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like that dude in that movie,
I can't feel my legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, wait, I can't feel my
legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm fucking numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel all rubbery and gumby like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Apothecary for
great work with the Tahoe batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who grew the material,
but the hash did a hell of a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to get my gumby ass
together here, and we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about some podcast stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had a great week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to come on the podcast and brag,
but holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to White Mike and also to
White Mike's wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike invited me to go see Kevin
Smith and Jason Muse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay and Silent Bob get old of recording of
a live podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Pueblo, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Smith and Jason Muse came to Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a live recording of their podcast
at a place called Memorial Hall,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is right downtown in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'm fucking surprised that
I've never been to a show at Memorial Hall
[SPEAKER_00]: because the place is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were right up front, so it seemed real
tiny to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a smaller sized venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I did notice that tickets for
every show were quite overpriced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the same show for cheaper
somewhere else, but it's a really tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a cool place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazed I've never been there for a
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kevin Smith and Jason Muse,
of course, Jay and Silent Bob from all the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay and Silent Bob movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Smith is director of quite a few
movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He directed Mallrats, Clerks, Chasing Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tusk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make fun of him a lot for Tusk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay and Silent Bob strike back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we got to go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike got front row tickets for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike went, his wife joined, and our buddy
Brian from work tagged along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: other ticket that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, thanks for taking me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laughed my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a lot of edibles before I went,
and I took a gigantic dab right before the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone's like, a couple of my friends
are like, you okay, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm just high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything to fucking say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were trying to talk to me,
and I just couldn't think of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no words.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were not words for my head at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't shit for me to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just stayed silent most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday night, I zipped home from work,
kind of cleaned up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went and saw Kevin Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Saturday, what did I do Saturday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hung out a little bit, did some gardening,
did some stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then went up to Colorado Springs and
saw Harry Moe and the Colorado Reggae Unit
[SPEAKER_00]: featuring Miss Jenny Beth on vocals,
and quite a few other amazing reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched them play one set, danced
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't many people dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought, watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let my dreadlocks down, and I went and
stand in the middle of the dance floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went and stood in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I just say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Went and stood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said I went and standed.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and stood in the middle of the
dance floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to dance, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so bad at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five, and I'm lanky and I'm
goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just let my dreadlocks down and just
wiggle around like a fucking white hippie
[SPEAKER_00]: and just shake my dreadlocks around to the
reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reggae band was smiling at me
like, I know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly all the people were
dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to break the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then for the second set, we ate some
food during the set break.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little break there for the
musicians to take a rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Played for about an hour, and then they
took a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was eating some food,
finishing up some of JB's free meals she
[SPEAKER_00]: gets for being in the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they yelled, Rasta Jeff, we need you
to come up here and play djembe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they invited me up on stage again to go
play djembe with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to join the reggae band.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of really good reggae musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, I think all of them are
probably older than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like playing with older
musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a better tempo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more musical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing against young musicians,
but the older cats have something,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need a rhythm section that just
lays back and plays rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a whole bunch of fancy
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are older cats and they
nail it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Jenny Beth, Harry Moe,
and the entire Colorado reggae unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's turn down this music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am still dead the fuck out
from, I took two dads of that Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, I was like, that wasn't
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went in a little harder on the second
one and my whole body went numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got goosebumps and my arm hair moved
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel my eyes all droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm not doing a terrible podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, let's talk about my
newest breeding project, my newest and
[SPEAKER_00]: most recent breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always talking about breeding stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my current breeding project,
I have got, of course, it's a King Solomon
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon is Golden Goat Cross to the
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found an amazing male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably went through somewhere between
250 and 500 seeds of the Arise Cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the male that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the stud that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named him King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in a room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is getting ready to pollinate amongst
many other, several other sexy ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is going to pollinate, for the first
time, Cactus Cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time, he will pollinate
Durban Poison and he will also pollinate a
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be Cactus Cooler,
Durban Poison, and Stardog all across to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Arise in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I am really excited
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about the Stardog
because Stardog to Arise, that's gonna,
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog's already a great producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna put more of a funk to
the flavor and it should increase
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should increase production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban Poison Cross, I'm hoping that
that brings out some of that anise and
[SPEAKER_00]: licorice and that funky flavor from the
Durban Poison into the sweetness and the
[SPEAKER_00]: funkiness of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll be a very great cross now
that I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be, I have an idea of what it's
gonna be similar to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I wanna say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna let other people smoke it and see
if they see it also when it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cactus Cooler to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cactus Cooler tastes like pineapples and
oranges and sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping to bring that out in the
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cactus Cooler's already a huge growing
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a very interesting
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be something that may be a hit
for the outdoor grow season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that I'll get several phenotypes
that at least have that orangey,
[SPEAKER_00]: citrusy, pineappley kind of taste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna breed with that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that are
coming up in my newest breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep you guys updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, of course, some of the
classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classic females are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dog is in there to make
morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Widow is in there to make storm
shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies and Cream is in there to make the
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple others in there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna restock some of the old
stuff and create some new stuff at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's a couple of Arises in
there so we can make some more Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything in that room, there's a
purpose for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I was getting at by
talking about my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in there, I've got a goal and a
reason why I'm making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also going to start using a new
male in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm crossing a bunch of the older stuff
to have a nice stockpile of some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and making some new stuff at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff will be made into F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise that are being made in this room
right now will be F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some new ideas in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when January comes, they're changing
the limits in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my rules will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amounts of plants that I can have
will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my idea for breeding, instead of having
a large amount of females and one male,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be using probably two males and a
smaller amount of females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can keep my plant counts legal
and be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep myself protected under all the
Colorado laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most important things
that I have to do is make sure I'm legal
[SPEAKER_00]: and protected and safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that they're tightening all the
numbers here in Colorado, my breeding will
[SPEAKER_00]: become much more focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to think it through a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to use less space, less plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it challenges me a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to grow when it was completely
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving me rules and making me work with
rules and dance around those rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will follow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stay completely legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll still do well because I love a
good challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cheating now because,
you know, like we can have, you could buy
[SPEAKER_00]: all the gear, you could do it legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you couldn't even have
the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get in trouble for having a grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can have the shit and grow as long
as you're not growing too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as they're gonna let me grow a
certain amount, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making me think a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, my breeding projects are gonna
tighten up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see a little bit of different
stuff coming from me pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see a different male enter
the scene pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a feminized project
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done much feminized stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it will not be the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be something brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll talk about that when that time
comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I feel like the main topic of this
show may take a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should work our way into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I cover all the opening stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, we'll talk about it next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the main topic of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't follow me on Instagram,
you should follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iregenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out my Instagram Live
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my Instagram Live videos, I let people
ask random questions and then I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer them to the best of my ability with
no preparation, with no notes,
[SPEAKER_00]: just off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to give them the best advice and
guidance I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of fun times talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we take a bunch of dabs or I
take a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what everybody else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I take dabs, I eat edibles and hang
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody on one of my Instagram Live
videos asked me to talk about what F1
[SPEAKER_00]: means and what IBL means and all that type
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did give a brief explanation there on
Instagram Live, but I feel like it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a great podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a few notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did write some of this stuff down so
that I actually sound like I know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told me that I got it all right
on the Instagram Live video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just pulled it out of my ass and
shut it out off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all said I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was proud of myself there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made notes this time so that we can
talk about what land races are,
[SPEAKER_00]: what an IBL, what an F1 through F5 and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll talk about a few other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't know what I'm talking
about, here's where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to shop for seeds, if you're
looking to buy a new package of seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to grow something new,
there's a whole bunch of letters and
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers on the package that may not make
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see, let me just pick across that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go random, but I'm going to pick
something of mine, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Storm Shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow is White Widow cross to the
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also kind of a poly-hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just write Storm Shadow X
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would show you Storm Shadow to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should always be listed with Ladies
First, whichever female plant was used
[SPEAKER_00]: since the Storm Shadow was the girl plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies First, Storm, or White Widow,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The White Widow was the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Widow X Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a White Widow girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obvious because the girl's Ladies
First is how it goes when you're listing
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, White Widow X Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of breeders will put either an
F1 or an F2 after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're going to put an F1 or an F2,
you have to put the White Widow to Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: White Widow X Arise in parentheses,
and then put F1 or F2 next to that because
[SPEAKER_00]: that will indicate that that whole cross,
it's the F2 of that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me talk about, I know that may
sound confusing, but it'll make more sense
[SPEAKER_00]: when I start talking about what an F1 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1, F stands for filial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The filial generation number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take, you create an F1 by crossing
two different parents, and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate parents when you're listing
genetics, it is a P. The letter P
[SPEAKER_00]: represents parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse the throat clearing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big dab is still getting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossing two different parents will
result in an F1, and those parents should
[SPEAKER_00]: be either inbred lines or land races,
and those will make F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what you're buying now are
polyhybrids, and we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that a little bit later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But crossing two different strains that
are either stabilized IBLs or stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: land races will make your F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s, the first cross, if you take two
different things, a boy and a girl and
[SPEAKER_00]: cross them, filial generation one,
brand new shit, that new new is F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So F1s are cool because they have hybrid
vigor, which means it's two new things
[SPEAKER_00]: that have finally hit and there's so much
new energy in there, those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow huge, they're going to grow
better than your parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hybrid vigor is going to come out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 is semi-stable in phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see phenotypes that look
like mommy, you're going to see phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like daddy, you're going to see
some that mix, and then you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see some that are widely different,
like way off there, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get pretty close to mommy and daddy and
then the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably, 25% mommy, 25% daddy,
25% a perfect cross, and then 25% of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are just going to be fucking whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whatever genetics are in there,
you'll see crosses of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of weird shit in 25% of them,
and that's a guess, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only estimate on genetics on what
you're going to see, but on average,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of what you can expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So F1s are cool because they've got that
hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a lot of cool
phenotypes from an F1 hybrid, and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some brand new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why F1s are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, if you grow, if you take a male
and a female of two different strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: you pollinate the female and seeds come
out, you have now made F1, you take those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and you grow them, and you can
either just leave them open and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have all the males and all the girls
together, or you can take a select male
[SPEAKER_00]: and a select girl, or you can take a
select male and several select girls and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pollinate that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's either open pollination of a whole
bunch of F1s or selective breeding of F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pollinate that together,
the seeds that come out of the F1s,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you take a seed from F1 and a seed from
F1 and one's a boy, one's a girl,
[SPEAKER_00]: or there's a cluster of boys and girls,
the seeds that come from that are F2,
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation, F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those, you're going to have a little
more stabilization than the F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get a little bit closer,
but you're going to see some random shit
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have 50% mom, 50% dad,
and then some variation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2s are always, it depends on how the
selective breeding process went.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do an open pollination,
you're going to get a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did a selective breeding,
you're going to see less different
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if I take my favorite male and my
favorite female from that F2 and I breed
[SPEAKER_00]: them, now I've just made an F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you continue doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can continue doing that until you
reach whatever number you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the time you get to the F4,
the F5 generation, if you've done your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding correctly, things will start
coming out like clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant 50 seeds and 25 are male,
because these are regular, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: non-feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant 50, 25 of them, about 25,
if you're going to get 50%, 25 will be
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 25 of them are going to look
almost like clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be very identical if
you've done your breeding properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you keep breeding, you work on
what is known as an inbred line,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you are just inbreeding,
which means you are actually eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: traits because you are breeding for
selective traits and you're narrowing it
[SPEAKER_00]: down to where you're just inbreeding and
inbreeding to get the perfect plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's when you have created an inbred
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: An inbred line, also known as an IBL,
you guys, an inbred line, are hybrids or
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses that have been stabilized to show
very little variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking about, they almost look
like you're making clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inbreed by just selecting the plant
that looks just like you want and then
[SPEAKER_00]: breed that one and then pull the seeds out
and then grow one and find one that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just like what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then make F4 of that and then find
ones that look just like what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the F5 of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you get to F5,
they're all going to start looking like
[SPEAKER_00]: how you want them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you're inbreeding it to get
exactly where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go F7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have never seen anybody go
past an F5 that I know of, but it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: F5 seems to be far enough to get these
seeds completely stabilized to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: how we want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short said if he goes past F5,
when he sells them, it doesn't leave any
[SPEAKER_00]: work for the public to breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing left.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come out looking just like what
he did if he goes to the F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess DJ Short has gone F6 and he
just goes back to the F5 and releases
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably, he's been breeding for
longer than I've been alive, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's probably got some F7s,
F9s or some shit in his arsenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just doesn't release them or talk about
them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's when you get yourself to an
IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: An inbred line is when you've inbred it so
much that it's super stabilized to where
[SPEAKER_00]: almost every seed you plant comes out
looking like a clone of the last seed you
[SPEAKER_00]: planted or the next seed you're going to
plant from that same filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very common way to find an inbred
plant or an IBL line, an inbred line,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land braces are purebred lines from
specific areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know about like Durban
poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legendary Durban poison is a land race
from the Durban area of Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably came, and I don't know how
accurate this is, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what my, kind of, if I had to make
up a story of a land race plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere, somebody traveled to a place
and they gave somebody some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that person smoked that weed,
and they're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like thousands of years ago in
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making up this vision in my head right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people that spoke different languages
from different villages were traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere, and one guy brought a bunch of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even a bunch, just some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shared some weed with this guy in
this other village, and he got five seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that guy smoked that weed,
and he's like, holy shit, that shit was
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to grow those fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grew the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't know anything about pulling
mails because this was way back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know they wanted sensimilio
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he grew all five seeds, and they got
crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males and the females all bred with
each other, and the seeds fell into the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground just like it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he had like a thousand seeds just
sprout up next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh shit, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he cut down some.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the males and females that survived,
they bred again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened year after year after
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy only had one strain of herb on
his property.
[SPEAKER_00]: For however many years he grew weed,
and then his son took over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his son grew that same strain on that
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe nature did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the people that grew it 100,000
years ago died, and nature took over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been nature F27 to this fucking
plant out there without anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: intervening, because that's what cannabis
would do if nobody got in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just keep going year after year
after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this plant's on like F200,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an inbred land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inbred itself so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's just, every seed that you
plant is gonna look and smell just like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think a land race is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think an inbred line and a land race are
very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think inbreds are kinda done human,
and a land race was done by nature over a
[SPEAKER_00]: course of time before humans intervened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine traveling back, way back in the
day, whatever you believe the earth was
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's round, whatever the fuck you believe
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still round then, it's still round
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are traveling around it then,
and it could be one piece of continent,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a broken up bunch of
continents, it could be whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that way, as long as you agree
that it's fucking round, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody got some herbs somewhere,
and they traveled around, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped, obviously they dropped some off
in Thailand, because there's Thailand
[SPEAKER_00]: races.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dropped some off in Brazil,
because there's Brazilian land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just dropped off a few seeds,
and it F37ed itself, and I'm just being
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetical with the F37s and whatever,
but that's kinda what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody traveled around with a little bit
of weed, and it got dropped in off in all
[SPEAKER_00]: these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam, because there's Vietnamese land
races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's Afghan land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are land races everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are Mexican land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican sativa land races are fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, because people are afraid of
Mexican land races, because they think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be schwag weed, just because
most of the weed they bought from Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: was compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make any fucking sense,
I just think it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my take on a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds got traveled around way back before
it was common for people to get around a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were unadulterated, and they just
bred themselves, either with the help of a
[SPEAKER_00]: local farmer, or by nature, but there were
no more seeds introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no more variations,
or no more varietals introduced to that to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed, to outbreed that, to outcross it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just stayed the same, and kept
stabilizing itself, and getting better and
[SPEAKER_00]: better over time, and that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those genetics are those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never got adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's land races in bread lines,
and filial generations one through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about something else you
might see on a seed pack, is BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: BX stands for bat crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now bat crossing would be, if I took an
F1, so if I cross some stuff, let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just go with the Golden Goat to the
Daybreaker, cross those, you make an Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I took an Arise F1 seed,
and pollinated it with the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker male, that would be a bat
cross, and that was really confusing for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to do, because I was trying to think
all the different names of the strains as
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna say it again just to make
sure I get it right, and I'm gonna read my
[SPEAKER_00]: notes without using strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bat crossing is crossing an F1 back to an
original parent, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make an F1 with a boy and a girl,
the baby comes out, and then you either
[SPEAKER_00]: can cross it back to the boy, or back to
the dad, or back to the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people might say, why would you
wanna do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good explanation of why,
and this will lead me into BX2,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a bat cross number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you wanna make seeds that are
not feminized, because if you want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: be feminized, it's a different process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want regular seeds of a strain that
is clone only, and you do not have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a female of it, but you don't
have a male of it, what you can do is
[SPEAKER_00]: create a bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps I wanna make Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a male of Grateful Dog,
I've only got a female of Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I wanna make Grateful Dog seeds that
are not feminized, because I made
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds, that's the only way it's
available, is feminized Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I wanna make my favorite
Grateful Dog female that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna make it available in regular
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find something that is similar to
it, kind of, kind of similar to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe I'd find, I don't know,
there's two different routes to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cross it with a male, okay,
I would find a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross it with a male that's very
similar to it, it's gonna be harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the male that looks like the Grateful
Dog to reuse for the BX, but if you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it to a male that's very different,
the one that's closer to the Grateful Dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grateful Dog will stand out and it
will be easier to determine which one to
[SPEAKER_00]: bat cross with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole lot of different talking,
but for this example, we're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grateful Dog female, and since I've
got the Arise male on my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to use the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna pollinate that Grateful Dog
with the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have just made, that's actually
Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's take Morning Dew and find a
Morning Dew male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna find a male out of this Morning
Dew that looks just like the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a male Grateful Dog kind
of looking plant, and I wanna pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: that female Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have just made a BX, I have made a
bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's another way you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take one of those Morning Dew
seeds and I could find a female that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the Grateful Dog, and then I can
take that original Arise pollen and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: that on there again, and then that's gonna
make more seeds that would actually be a
[SPEAKER_00]: bat cross again, but it's not the way I
was trying to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to make the Grateful Dog,
and I think by finding the male that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Grateful Dog and putting it back
on the Grateful Dog female, I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting so many Grateful Dog dominant
genetics into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna be very Grateful Dog
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will take seeds that come from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have taken the Morning Dew male
that looks like Grateful Dog, and I put it
[SPEAKER_00]: back onto the Grateful Dog female,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have made Grateful Dog BX1 because I
have gone backwards and used the Grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog female that was in there, I'm bat
crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with the male, you can do it
with the female, either way it works,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my goal right now is to try to make
that Grateful Dog in regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have made the Morning Dew to the
Grateful Dog bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would take seeds that come from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow those BX1s and find one that
looks just like a Grateful Dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: and once again, I would bat cross,
and I'm gonna find a male, and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take that male that looks like the
Grateful Dog, and I'm gonna put that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen on my female Grateful Dog,
and now I have made Grateful Dog BX2
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am gonna press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a drink and a dab,
and I'm actually gonna listen back to this
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure I feel like I got this
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any comments or concerns on
what I've just said, I would love all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your input.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
or of course, you can send me a tweet at
[SPEAKER_00]: GFYHpodcast on Twitter, or you can find me
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the Grow From Your Heart podcast
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm gonna press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna dab some of this Tahoe batter,
and then I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened back to everything I said,
and I feel like I was accurate in what I
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke, so I'm gonna continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to talk about are
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, feminized seeds are labeled
differently, or at least they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't oftentimes labeled correctly,
is what I've noticed, but that's up to
[SPEAKER_00]: individual breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they should be labeled as
feminized, at least, and then the correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're labeling them genetics-wise to
list what they are, like on a website,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're gonna say, hey, this crosses
this to this, it would be an S1 if you
[SPEAKER_00]: took a, and we're just gonna pick a random
strain that we keep playing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took the grateful dog and I reversed
it, which would mean I treated it with
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate or gibberellic acid,
or maybe the other type of silver,
[SPEAKER_00]: colloidal silver, which I don't feel works
well enough, I do the silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, but if you treated the grateful
dog plant and pollinated another clone of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grateful dog, the same plant,
it's gotta be the same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to reverse one and pollinate one
that is the same cultivar, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing the same cut, and pollinating
the same cut, you are now making S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a self-seed, that is an S1,
is what that is, so if you reverse a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and make seeds of itself,
you are making S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I were to reverse that grateful
dog and take that grateful dog pollen that
[SPEAKER_00]: is now feminized pollen, and I put that
pollen on any plant other than the
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog, I am making what is known as
an R1, a reversal one, so I'm using
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized pollen on a different cut to
create new feminized polyhybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those are two that you need to know
about, S1 and R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, earlier I said something about
breeding with land races and breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what you see available in the
seed catalogs, and I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: included, I'm not calling anybody out,
I am part of this group, a lot of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: are breeding is actually polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are taking F1s and F2s, possibly F3s,
and breeding them to other F1s or F2s,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are not completely stabilized
polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they are, yes, they are polyhybrids,
but they are stable enough.
Most of us breeders are aware enough and
educated enough and experienced enough to
know if that strain is worth crossing or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a good idea for us to breed
some of those plants that are being used
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding, although through
experimentation and testing, those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have been tested well enough for my
approval to be used in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're not gonna hermaphrodite on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the progeny they create is not
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they are, yes, they are polyhybrids,
but they are stable enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us breeders are aware enough and
educated enough and experienced enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: know if that strain is worth crossing or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a good idea for us to breed
something to the F5 before we crossed it
[SPEAKER_00]: to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make a true F1, but the
polyhybrids is kind of where the market
[SPEAKER_00]: has gone to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of where cannabis breeding has
gone to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its pros and its cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now that you know all of the glossary
words, we've got land race, we've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: IBL, which means an inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got F1s, F2s, all the way up to F5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start becoming an IBL,
basically, you can go F6 or 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about nature, probably doing F50.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably somewhere in some jungle
or on some island that those plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: just been making their finial generations
without interruption that we don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got the F generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got bat crosses, which is when
you take an F1 back to the parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you've got a bat cross,
too, is when you take a BX1 back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have got the self, which is when
we start playing with feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got the R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got polyhybrids, which is
mostly what we're seeing on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've got all these glossary
terms, let's talk a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling on seed packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the companies do it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, myself, will list Golden Goat X
Daybreaker, and then it will say Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's Golden Goat across the
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other breeders that would list
the genetics of the Golden Goat in a
[SPEAKER_00]: parentheses, which would be, in one
bracket, you'd have a parentheses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it would say Island Sweet Skunk X
Romulan, then another parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would say Hawaiian Sativa,
then another parentheses, closing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shows you that it's an Island
Sweet Skunk to Romulan female crossed to a
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian Sativa male in one set of
parentheses is like a math problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got parentheses starting it,
and then another one closing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then another one even closing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what direction you call those
parentheses, but one part's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: parentheses, and then there's another one
on the end of that to make that all one
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: X, the Daybreaker, which is Joseph OG X
Chem D, those two would be in parentheses
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would show the male, the breakdown
of the male, all in parentheses,
[SPEAKER_00]: X, the breakdown of the, or the female,
X, the male, all broken down into
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how some folks do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes you might see, and I'm gonna
get hypothetical right now, you may see
[SPEAKER_00]: just a pack labeled Arise BX2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that means the Arise was bat crossed,
but that does not indicate what male was
[SPEAKER_00]: used or what female was used in the bat
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be listed in the parentheses
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that means that that is the progeny of
the bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say, now they may say Arise,
BX2 in parentheses, or Arise BX2X
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker in parentheses, and that means
that the Arise BX2 was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where those parentheses fall kinda
indicate which group the plants were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything in the brackets is that
plant, and then if it stays inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: another set of brackets, it's still that
plant, but it's the male or the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I said makes sense,
because if you're listing the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents, if you're going that far to
list your stuff, if it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: female, X male in parentheses,
X female, X male in parentheses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the first set of parentheses will be
the female, the second set will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes you're gonna see maybe a
breeder used something that's got three
[SPEAKER_00]: things in it, because maybe he took a boy
and a girl and crossed those, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed those to another boy, and used the
offspring of that as a female in the
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have female, X male in
parentheses, X, male, and then you just
[SPEAKER_00]: put another parentheses to close that,
and that would show you that that's your
[SPEAKER_00]: female, and then X, and then whatever your
male is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm explaining that properly
without writing it down on a dry erase
[SPEAKER_00]: board and showing you what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I might just be confusing you,
but keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies first, and if it gets too confusing
when you're trying to write something
[SPEAKER_00]: down, just make it simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of writing all this, X of this,
X of this, parentheses, just write Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat times Daybreaker, Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get right to the point,
it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want you to be able to understand it
if you do see all these weird labels,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some people try to just make it
look fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks out there, I'll give a lot of
respect and a lot of acknowledgement to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin Gordon and the Ethos Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys labeled their shit correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little confusing, but if you're an
experienced grower and you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at, it makes a lot of sense
and it is very helpful, because they offer
[SPEAKER_00]: different versions of the same line,
which can be confusing if you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you guys learned a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have just confused you guys a whole
bunch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to you about how to label
things and how to read a seed package.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since I've talked about land races
and inbred lines and all this breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, I want to talk about something that
I've seen in a couple of videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a breeder, a group of
breeders that travel around the world and
[SPEAKER_00]: they like to go to places and I'm not
hating on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just bringing this up to spark
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually respect these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a lot of work for the
cannabis community and the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that before I kind of say what
I'm going to say and then we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make a conversation out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these breeders, they travel around the
world and they go to places like Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Jamaica, like they've gone all over
the fucking world to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of money and they've got
private jets and they know a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get all over the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys get access to go visit very
large outdoor ganja farms all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of these outdoor ganja farms
are older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are older than these guys that are
going to visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the places where the land race
strains are being grown just organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys didn't have access to any other
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody goes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody that goes there is bringing
cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, hey, I should go to
Jamaica and take cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody ever said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks I should go to Jamaica
and get cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody takes sand to the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the land race strains, I'm just going
to guess Jamaica now because I've said
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be what we stick with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land race that is growing in Jamaica
that these folks went down there and
[SPEAKER_00]: found, they went through it and they were
like, this one, this one's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they broke open a couple of buds and
they told the guy that owned the farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, can I take these seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy was like, oh yeah,
you could take plenty of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this breeder, brought home a big
old jar of Jamaican land race seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's got them, they're preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bred them to the next filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually sold them through his website
and through his breeding company,
[SPEAKER_00]: through his seed company and in his coffee
shops in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's what he did in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reached into his pocket and he offered
this farmer handfuls of his own seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: he has bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this company color coats all of their
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a product that so they make a
product, a strain called, and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out who I'm talking about if you
know what I'm talking about, but I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They coat all of their super lemon haze
seeds in a yellow coating so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just put them in a baggie and carry them
and they don't have to be labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know those yellow seeds are super
lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they coat all of the,
each strains got its own color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what the colors for all
of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just obvious that super lemon haze
was the yellow one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he reaches into his pocket and pulls
out what looks like a bag of M&Ms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just colored, feminized and
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he puts them in the farmer's hand and
says, thank you for the trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow these next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now great trade, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend with the seed company has now
got some great new Jamaican land race
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jamaican guy has now got some new shit
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, and I don't know if it's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious about this and I want to
know how you guys feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That land race in Jamaica that's been
growing there forever on that island
[SPEAKER_00]: without human adulteration has been
inbreeding itself and making itself
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect for that climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it produces the product that they're
familiar with every year and it drops
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and it grows and it does it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, has this breeding company,
has this seed sharer adulterated that land
[SPEAKER_00]: race by dropping off these other seeds on
this island?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the pollen is going to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everything going to get pollinated by
these other seeds that he left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were feminized and
non-feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were regular seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be males to pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys do not pull males.
[SPEAKER_00]: They throw out so many seeds and they just
let it grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cull any seeds because they
want the seeds for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want them to fall and then they want
the seeds that they can grow dope next
[SPEAKER_00]: year because they don't go get seeds from
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just been using this inbred land
race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of want your interaction on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys feel about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they traveling around the world
adulterating land races while at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time collecting land race seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can breed them for their own
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that seem like sort of a ploy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe eventually there won't be any land
races until you have to go shop with them
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them because they've traveled all
over the world and picked up some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: land race from everywhere and labeled it
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got land races from different
regions of different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got Northern Jamaica, Southern
Jamaica land races and they've got them
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled and they know exactly what they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also dropped off their own seeds
there and I'm sure that those farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: planted it because those farmers probably
weren't thinking the way that I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't like, he came to disrupt my
land race and he's going to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: to the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it disrupting their crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it improving their crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's detrimental to their
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want your opinion because it
just sparked a lot of thoughts in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interact with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys email me, tweet me, social media
with me about it and go watch the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I'm talking about,
go watch the videos again and see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious on your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one thing I should say to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was only just using Jamaica as an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are great growers in Jamaica,
especially now, but there have always been
[SPEAKER_00]: great growers in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks were calling the mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to get other good seeds in
Jamaica, but just a lot of the places that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about are like mountainside
rural places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've seen the videos,
these guys have gone to dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries and gathered cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also what can we do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if I'm going to start a
conversation and bring up a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have a solution, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you are a seed collector,
if you are a conservationist or a
[SPEAKER_00]: preserver of cannabis seeds, maybe you
should find a good vendor that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable land race seeds and get your
hands on all the land races that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be interested in before they get
all adulterated and messed up with the new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis revolution because money is
getting involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything worldwide is going to change
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got to teach you guys a
whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got to learn a bunch myself,
just doing some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like also I got to go on the rant
about that seed company that I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to say publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want your opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want your input on that.
