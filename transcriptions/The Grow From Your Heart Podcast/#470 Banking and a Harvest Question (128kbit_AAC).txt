[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 470 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of halo live
batter from our friends at green.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Headbanger and Infinity
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
deconstructed sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are getting really creative with
these names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it tasted like a
deconstructed sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate definitely has a funky,
dirty, deliciously disgusting,
[SPEAKER_00]: funky fuel aroma and flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part is that it makes me
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke this concentrate,
it is full retard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lose my keys when they're in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get lost when I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate makes me dumb,
and I fully appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious and amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: halo live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to talk about a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: experience I had at the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to read a message that came
from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that part of the show,
let's do a few shout outs to some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends from Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big thanks, big shout out,
big hug and big fist bump to everybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: has supported the show on the Patreon
campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's work our way into the
fun part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hinted that I wanted to talk about
something that recently happened at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently decided that it would be a wise
move to have another business bank
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to get into any of those
details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to the bank and I explained to
them my needs and what I wanted to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were happy to help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very nice lady took me to her office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I filled out some paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked me a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she started typing some details into
the computer and that was when she
[SPEAKER_00]: informed me that I would not be allowed to
open a business checking or savings
[SPEAKER_00]: account with her bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I immediately knew why,
but I chose to play dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, why is that ma'am?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, because you are currently a
key holder and we cannot offer a business
[SPEAKER_00]: banking account to anybody who is a key
holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what do you mean key holder?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my own business and I just played
dumb because I wanted to see where this
[SPEAKER_00]: would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she informed me that her computer
indicated to her that I have a Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Enforcement Division key
position badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me briefly explain this badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who works in a legal cannabis
facility in the state of Colorado is
[SPEAKER_00]: required to have a Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires an intensive background
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires thorough fingerprinting and it
requires a lot of questioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who wants to work in the industry
is required to have this badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple badges available at
different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those different levels of badges give you
different opportunities and availability
[SPEAKER_00]: for different positions in the facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks will have what is called a
support badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for somebody who would be a
trimmer or an assistant grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to have keys or make
decisions, you get what is called a key
[SPEAKER_00]: badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an owner, you've got a red
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means you own the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are transportation badges and there
are changes happening to the badging
[SPEAKER_00]: system as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time this episode comes out,
this could be inaccurate information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this time, there are three badges
that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly a fourth transportation badge
that I don't pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the support, the key, and the owner
badge are the main badges I think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold a support badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the owner and I'm not a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am somebody who is hands on with the
plants and I make decisions about what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore the bank has decided that they
cannot offer me any type of loan or
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts with their establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their reasoning for this is since my
source of income, my legal employment is
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal, they cannot risk taking
my money and banking with me because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are insured by the FDIC, which is federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my income is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a federal institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to mix my dirty federally
illegal money into their federally
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they simply smiled at me and said,
thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we simply cannot and will not help
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the opportunity to ask them if
they had any recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other banks in the area that
may be able to service me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said that this new computer
system flags everybody with a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement division badge in their
computer system when they attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish a new account.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said it's something that is linked to
their computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are directly linked to the marijuana
enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think she was purposefully looking
to find my badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it popped up and it did not take her
two minutes of typing into that computer
[SPEAKER_00]: to have all of my information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I played dumb about having
the badge, she recited my badge number and
[SPEAKER_00]: told me the expiration date of my badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she was kind enough to tell me that
when that badge expires, she would be more
[SPEAKER_00]: than happy to open an account for me to
come back in December and we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did also indicate that if I lower my
level of my badge, that then they could
[SPEAKER_00]: write a letter to the bank and they would
consider giving me the services that I
[SPEAKER_00]: require.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to reduce the level of
badge I have got right now because I need
[SPEAKER_00]: that for my work in the legal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a legal cannabis cultivation facility,
to remain compliant, you must have a key
[SPEAKER_00]: badge holder on scene at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I am at a facility where I'm
registered as an employee, I am on the
[SPEAKER_00]: employee roster list, I have got my key
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has to babysit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can say, go do your work,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at the grow, go inspect the grow,
go make the adjustments you need to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can give me free rein of the grow and
nobody has to babysit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I only had a support badge,
there would have to be somebody within
[SPEAKER_00]: visual distance of me at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not be allowed to roam around that
grow or those grows or those cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: areas at my own free will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would need a babysitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would need some sort of an escort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't be in the cultivation
facilities by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, I need that key badge so
that I can function and do my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, I am exploring more
options because I am sure that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other people like myself who are in the
medical cannabis industry, who also may
[SPEAKER_00]: own a small business, who also may need to
get a bank loan for a vehicle,
[SPEAKER_00]: who also may need to get a bank loan for a
new home, who also may just need banking
[SPEAKER_00]: services because we need banks in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard of many other people having
similar experiences with banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard of friends having accounts
shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen friends have their business
accounts closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen and heard of people being
denied requests for loans and being denied
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to open a new checking or
savings account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have never been discriminated
against like this since we have fully
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were times when cannabis was
becoming freshly legalized and people were
[SPEAKER_00]: still kind of weird about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few restaurants that would
treat us weird when we showed up stinking
[SPEAKER_00]: like dank and paid in a bunch of cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, I haven't felt that kind
of rejection or discrimination from a
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am looking into solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did ask this lady if there were any
other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that credit unions may be able to
help out with my situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in many banking circumstances,
people with a key badge or people with a
[SPEAKER_00]: support badge should be able to attain a
normal checking or savings account.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was trying to get was a small
business checking account so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: have a tax account where I just put money
in for taxes and don't spend it when tax
[SPEAKER_00]: time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got tax money sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes right out of that account.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this bank has refused to open my
backup tax account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just got to pay my taxes out of my
normal business account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal, but not what I wanted to
do with my business, with my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I should be able to put my
money in the bank and manage my money just
[SPEAKER_00]: like anybody else because I worked for it
legally, just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels kind of shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the ancillary issues that
we did not think about when it came to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every new legal market, until cannabis
is federally legal, this will be a hurdle
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hurdle for businesses that are
trying to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hurdle for people who work in
the industry or who are trying to live a
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who work in these grows are not
all stoner pothead bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people of all walks of life,
of all ages working in these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cultivators, there are trimmers,
but there are also lawyers and accountants
[SPEAKER_00]: and compliance managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who live a completely different
life than anybody who has ever been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal side of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a legal business now and the
majority of the people want to live like
[SPEAKER_00]: upstanding legal citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a slap in the face
that we're able to go to work every day
[SPEAKER_00]: and they take employment taxes out of our
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of those cannabis businesses have
to pay their taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to having a bank
account, they don't want anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's kind of a slap in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of bullshit that we
can't have a bank account because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal, but you'll take my tax
money even though it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have my dirty money if it's
dirty money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't get it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why once you take it,
it becomes clean now since it was dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: when I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bullshit, but that's just a side
rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a problem everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis gets legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were trying to open a business,
think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were trying to be in the industry,
sometimes it may be challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing and maintaining your credit
and your bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said a moment ago,
I am looking for solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Credit unions may be the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told there are a couple of banks
here in my area that will work with people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, most of the time it is easy to get
an account if you only have the support
[SPEAKER_00]: badge and if you are looking for a
personal account.
[SPEAKER_00]: My struggle is that I've got the key badge
which gives me too much access to too many
[SPEAKER_00]: things is what the lady said.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said you've got access to everything,
the safe, the money, the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that I am too deeply involved is
why they make the differential between the
[SPEAKER_00]: key badge and the support badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my key badge and the fact that I was
trying to open a business checking account
[SPEAKER_00]: flagged my account and they refused to
give me service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left the bank unsatisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat there for probably an hour waiting
for an appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a total waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are rules and laws in the works
and things are being discussed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but until those things are implemented,
it is still going to be frustrating for
[SPEAKER_00]: some folks in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move away from banking
and talk a little bit about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sent a very great message through my
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody commented on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scrolling through my messages right
now to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a person who calls
themselves a real rasher on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: They commented on one of my videos and the
comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a question based on the
Harvest Time podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about when to harvest and
how to determine ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is asking if we can harvest
the plant in multiple phases, maybe taking
[SPEAKER_00]: one branch at a time for a week and then
continuing that for multiple weeks until
[SPEAKER_00]: we have harvested the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an option that does work for
people growing one or two plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing stopping you from taking
that top cola that's nice and finished
[SPEAKER_00]: that will allow light to get to some of
those lower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll speed them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have more overall bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also allow more time for them to
ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can take those top buds again and
maybe have a third harvest of some lower
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't really do it branch by branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be a little bit too tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna leave you too many days apart
between your branches that are cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to be trimming a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day you cut, a few days later,
there's more work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to defoliate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few days, it's gonna dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to do work to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more days from there,
you've got to do more work to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dry and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a bunch of branches that
are three days apart, it's really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make your drying and curing process kind
of a staggered pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it in two, maybe three phases
if you were going to stagger it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do that top, the main top section
that's really done, then leave the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: then take that middle when it finishes,
then take the bottom if you're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it in staggered phases at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this method for several
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because I am a commercial
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's harvest time, I cut everything
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean the room and I refill it so there
is zero downtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every square foot of space in my facility
is worth dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having plants that are just waiting to
finish in some spots and not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: refill the entire room and start over
completely gets frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we grow
plants that we know are going to be done
[SPEAKER_00]: at 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at day 63 days, they all come down and
I can refill it with more plants that take
[SPEAKER_00]: 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stay on a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pull 5.77 harvest per root per year
on that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put eight week plants in there,
I can pull six full harvests in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I need to stay on schedule because
when I fall behind schedule, money doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: come in at the time we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then paychecks can't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rent can't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utility bills can't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything falls to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to stay on schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my main reason for not doing this
type of a thing in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply want to cut and clean and
restart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I also don't want my trim crew
cutting half of a plant and having to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with half of that plant and coming back a
few days later and cutting the other half
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got two different harvest
batches that are one week apart and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to dry and cure these bitches a week
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a problem when it is on a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your small personal grow, this would
work beautifully, especially in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of your question was, will this
stress the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the genetics of your plant,
depending on how rough you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how late or early you decide
to start chopping, this could very well
[SPEAKER_00]: stress the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the top and you're a little
bit too rough or you piss that plant off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could cause some stress to the lower
parts of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if all things go well, you're going to
cut it down in seven to 10, maybe 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of those problems will have a
chance to present themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may piss the plant off, but it's not
going to hermaphrodite on you overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to spit out seeds on you
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does herm on you overnight,
it's not going to cause any problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're paying attention, you'll see
some hermaphrodite flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to cut down the plant
before any of those flowers cause any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if you see hermaphrodite
flowers that late into the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing to pollinate because it is
way too late to pollinate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't any other plants that are
available for pollen that late in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should not be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, yes, you could start
harvesting the top and then you could wait
[SPEAKER_00]: a few days and you could take the middle
and then you could wait another week and
[SPEAKER_00]: take the bottom or you could just do it in
two phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't do it branch by branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be frustrating and that will
stress out the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But harvesting your personal outdoor crop
in two or three chunks should not present
[SPEAKER_00]: too many problems if you have a big
harvest that you can't manage by yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: in one move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know most people are looking for
peak ripeness out of their trichomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want every bud to be just perfect
before they harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless your plant is gigantic,
I don't think you're going to notice much
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the buzz from the buds at
the top and the buzz at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cut the plant down on one day and we
dry it and cure it and smoke a bud from
[SPEAKER_00]: the top and a bud from the bottom,
even though those top buds are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more done, I don't think you will notice
much of a difference unless you are like
[SPEAKER_00]: an absolute super connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think you're going to
notice much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, once those buds make
it to the bag or to the jar, they all mix
[SPEAKER_00]: up anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you smoke a joint and it's
usually one or two buds ground up and
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed together or you smoke a couple of
bowls and you will get the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless your plant is massive,
I don't think you're going to notice much
[SPEAKER_00]: of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would be worth the
staggered harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is something you want to do
because you really want those trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in and if it's outdoors and there's
nothing stopping you from leaving the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom half for another week, go ahead and
let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you pay attention to the
temperature because it is getting really
[SPEAKER_00]: cold outside and I don't want you to leave
that second half out there and destroy it
[SPEAKER_00]: and not even get to harvest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also make sure that the thieves don't
come and get that second half.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they see you take the tops down,
they'll go, oh, shit, he's going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant down soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go get the second half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main reason we don't do this in an
indoor situation is because we really just
[SPEAKER_00]: need to chop and clean up and get started
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our plants aren't super massively
large and an indoor cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference between the top and the
bottom is very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody would notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also selected cultivars that
finish in the timeframe that we need our
[SPEAKER_00]: grows to run in, which is generally nine
weeks in a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real rasher, I hope I answered your
