[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me show you how I do it.
Hits from the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hits from the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want a hit from the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want another hit from the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: All day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: First you dip it, you dab it, then you
fire it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And take that hit from the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now put your bum down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?

us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please send me your questions about
phenohunting or anything else you'd like
[SPEAKER_07]: to hear about on the show and I will talk
about it on a future episode.

[SPEAKER_07]: Here goes the Fino Hunt talk with the
boys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for listening, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, what's up, ladies and
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_07]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are gathered today.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like we're in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought church.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, church or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it is going to be a sermon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got Spence back on the mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got a new guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Michael on the microphone with us
tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a Twitter name or something
people can look for and find you on or on
[SPEAKER_07]: Instagram so they can check you out while
they're listening to the show?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at Colorado Bearded Dabbers on

[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado Bearded Dabbers in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: What up?
[SPEAKER_07]: What up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, big shout out to the whole CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to talk about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody here is a pretty experienced
grower, so everyone will have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: input.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should explain what a phenotype is.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing, I'll take one step back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will explain a genotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: The offspring of two parents will make
genetics, and that genetic makeup is the
[SPEAKER_07]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of that genotype, there will be
various phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The best way I can think of to compare it
would be when your parents make kids,
[SPEAKER_07]: they don't all look the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your dad's probably tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mom's probably a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them's got blonde hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them's got dark hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they make kids, sometimes they come
out with kids with blonde hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they come out with kids with
dark hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they come out blue-eyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they come out brown-eyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plants are going to do the same thing,
and that's to be expected.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are ways to minimize those traits or
bring out traits that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, when you're making
seeds in the beginning, the seeds that
[SPEAKER_07]: most of you guys are able to get your
hands on, what a lot of the breeders are
[SPEAKER_07]: selling you, are going to be F1s,
F2s, or F3s.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are very few breeders going further
than F4.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one guy I know that brags about
F5, which is really cool, really
[SPEAKER_07]: respectable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to see a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just talked a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel there's a lot of echo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I talked a lot about variation
in phenotypes and a lot of F1 and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: In F1, when you take two plants,
a male and a female plant, those are now
[SPEAKER_07]: your P1s.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you breed them, the seeds that come
out of that are F1.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have a lot of variety
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some stuff's going to look like mom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some stuff's going to kind of look like
the dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to get a lot of switch,
and then you're going to get stuff way in
[SPEAKER_07]: the middle between the mom and the dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get that perfect hybrid.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of times the one that
everybody's looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then a little further, you'll make an F2.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you find a sweet male and a sweet
female out of those F1s and you breed
[SPEAKER_07]: those together, you're going to make an
F2.
[SPEAKER_07]: F2 is where you come up with something
that we call transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means, and Jesse smiled when I
mentioned this pre-show, transgressive
[SPEAKER_07]: segregation is when your actual progeny,
which is your offspring, outperforms the
[SPEAKER_07]: parents.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take two seeds, a male and a
female, and you cross them, and that plant
[SPEAKER_07]: that comes out is way more badass than the
parents, you have just experienced
[SPEAKER_07]: transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The F2 level is where you really want to
buy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: If a breeder is selling those seeds,
a lot of us don't really let you know what
[SPEAKER_07]: we're giving you, which F level,
how far it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's breeding secrets, but those F2s are
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can get a hold of those,
that's where a lot of cool shit happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: The variation, a lot of us at the table
seem to love the variation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do what is called a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: We buy a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You grow that whole pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's usually 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not going to breed, you
eliminate the females.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, you've got- Males.
[SPEAKER_07]: The males.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm dabbed out by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching my back.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to pull those males, and then you
keep it going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm trying to catch my breath also.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the seed pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep the females going.
[SPEAKER_07]: You try to find the good ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: You look for the traits that those are
putting off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Early on, you could tell structure,
speed of growth, vigor, leaf size.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could tell if you got a more indica or
sativa leaning phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Node spacing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Node spacing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people like to jerk the stem a
little bit and smell that, and they think
[SPEAKER_07]: that that's going to lead to a lot of what
it's going to really smell like in the
[SPEAKER_07]: end.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early resin production.
[SPEAKER_07]: Early resin production.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to see that resin about day 30,
25-ish, getting frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things are going real well,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about yourself over there,
new guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: You want it louder or quieter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's just this thing over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked about this headphone thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm usually looking for usually a shorter,
stockier plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shorter, stocky plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually like more indica plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm usually looking for a
shorter, stockier plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also don't like when they wave around
too much because usually when they start
[SPEAKER_04]: stacking, they're going to need to be
staked up a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the plant that kind of supports
itself a little.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you, Spence?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when I grow seeds, you can usually
figure out whether or not your plant's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be ... Well, depending.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I grow plants under a scrog net.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lengthier plants you'll get will be
better for a scrog net, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then your shorter, stockier plants
will be your just freestanding plants that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can stake down and don't have to give
too much support besides that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But vigor, smells, and then I look for ...
Especially if I know what it's coming
[SPEAKER_05]: from, you can look at your leaf sets and
see if they start matching parents and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can know which parent you've kind
of got.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said something sort of interesting
that leads me to another point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing the fino hunt, running a pack of
seeds and looking for that fino that you
[SPEAKER_07]: like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of these guys grow different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody in this room grows a different
style.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spence does the scrog net.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't do any scrogging.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to run a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those plants you guys are worried about
waving around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a tomato cage on those early on
in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're not going to get me around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate her doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that stretchy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of not stretchy, but I mean,
with some height to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, hey, look, that's what ... I
just got to talk into my damn mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to break love to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just bite down on the mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds a lot better that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always tell everyone, get up on the mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the one over here, nowhere near the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get punk with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't want my teeth on that thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not that punk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some days you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you after your wedding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Burn, thanks for taking good care of
me at the hydro shop the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn was working and she treated me well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_07]: The store looks great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one big empty spot now where I was
shopping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be refilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it already is.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about phenotypes and
variation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people get angry about variation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Spence said to talk about S1s.
[SPEAKER_07]: We skipped S1.
[SPEAKER_07]: S1 is when I do a lot of S1s.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a feminized seed essentially,
or kind of usually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if I take my grateful dog,
two grateful dog clones of the same plant,
[SPEAKER_07]: reverse one, throw that pollen on the
other one in flower, those seeds are not a
[SPEAKER_07]: new, it's not a new breed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just an S1.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've selfed it and made seeds of that same
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's an S1.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that those, a lot of people hate on
feminized seeds, but if an S1 is done
[SPEAKER_07]: properly, and I want to hear your guys'
opinions because you've been growing my
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds a little bit, do the S1s seem to
mirror their parents a little bit more
[SPEAKER_07]: than the regular?
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely think like S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I had, I think it was like,
I can't remember what it was, but it came
[SPEAKER_05]: out so different, but so much like it's
like one of its original parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it the Capelton?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might've been the Capelton.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I gave you a bunch of Capelton
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell everybody that Spence is
actually who threw down that white widow
[SPEAKER_07]: female that I use in the Capelton cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've contributed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I gave him the first handful of seeds I
made out of that to run for me,
[SPEAKER_07]: just to say thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I saw that in the pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see the grateful dog, but then if
you knew that it was that white widow mom,
[SPEAKER_07]: you could see her in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could definitely see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got buddies running it now and I can
look at them from, you know, four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks after they've been planted and you
can see in the structure and then in the
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf sets, like what parent it's related
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not related to, but closest to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can almost tell them, keep that one,
pull that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting good with the shit I've bred.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting really good with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Vigorlover.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vigorlover is growing his shit out of some
Capelton like a boss.
[SPEAKER_07]: He makes dank water hash and grows that
strain like a pro.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for doing my seeds justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your experience with S2s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to say F2, if you don't mind
answering.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the S1s come out, I would say 50% of
them look like mommy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other 50 are a little weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's odd to say for a breeder,
but you get mutants and shit when you do
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're putting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cousin fucking essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm not supposed to say that word
on the podcast anymore, but there's no
[SPEAKER_07]: better way to put that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cousin fucking.
[SPEAKER_07]: S2s come out even more uniform.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say maybe 70% more uniform.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not the mathematician and I didn't
keep good enough notes, I guess,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're even more uniform.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't realize I was doing something
unique when I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took the same grateful dog, the original
female and kept taking a clone and using
[SPEAKER_07]: that reversed female to make seeds again
and then making another generation almost
[SPEAKER_07]: inbreeding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've gotten it so far that those come
out like clones, those grateful dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: The S4 generation, I think is kind of what
it would be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know a lot of people that have
done it, so I don't know how to label it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's S4.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those have come out, they're like clones
of each other, growing seeds from clone,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is kind of nice for a breeder to
achieve in a feminine seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those aren't out in the market yet,
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what you're getting yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't made enough of them to check,
but yeah, you guys will get them
[SPEAKER_07]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet those will be very popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's gonna be very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know anybody that's gotten them
that far.
[SPEAKER_07]: You always find weird shit in nice seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I ask, because I don't think
I've ever grown an S2 that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown up to F3 or F4.
[SPEAKER_07]: How far have you made, if you don't mind
me asking?
[SPEAKER_00]: BX3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the point I don't know if I want to
back cross it one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty happy with what I got from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I want to start in-crossing it and
start making, I guess it'd be a F1,
[SPEAKER_00]: F2 generation, and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: What percentage of those seeds now are
coming out to be what you have in mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different phenotypes,
and I really like them both.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you got two, you can identify
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some less desirable phenotypes,
and I worked them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe on the BX2 generation when I
made the threes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one phenotype I call One Night Stand,
and it's a hazy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm shaking my head going, why didn't I
write that down one day?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, damn, he just killed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one is just the Depot
Dog, and it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Kim Dog stabilization project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot like Kim D.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit like Diesel, a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More unique thing, or not unique,
but different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly different than Kim D,
but a lot like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, we're throwing around a lot of crazy
terms here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my bad for, our bad for kind of
fucking yell up, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, they'll catch up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We inspire them to learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're lost, Google it if you want to,
or just keep listening, and eventually
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll fill you in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not be this episode, but all the
stuff that we're saying will sound like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll sound like us in just a few months
if you keep listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to other people, and reading books,
and experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your favorite girl book?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the start, that's the roots of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a reliable book you go to,
Michael?
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite one, I don't really go to it
as much anymore, but was True Living
[SPEAKER_04]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great book.
[SPEAKER_05]: T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_05]: is my pick up book if I need to go search
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm not hitting the internet,
I'm going to go, that book's pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Rev.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys need help building soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a great book.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk about, Jesse and I talk a lot
about soil building on our outdoor
[SPEAKER_07]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you, if we go too fast, if you want
more specifics, that book will fill you
[SPEAKER_07]: in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll teach you a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: For myself, I like the Ed Rosenthal
Oakster Dam course guide, because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: thorough.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got bug explanations.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got all kinds, if I have a problem,
that's the first book I go to.
[SPEAKER_07]: If one of you guys is like, hey bro,
and I don't know the answer, I go get that
book.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get that one and read it and act like I
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that available to the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is available to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never read that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Between that one and Jorge's book,
you can cover just about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge's book's great too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to say it's outdated, but it feels,
it's like your dad wrote it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like that generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I don't feel like Mel Franks is the
dude's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Robert Connell Clark is what I think
you're thinking of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marijuana Botany?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, not that far back.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, this one was written early 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the title is How to Grow, or in the
first chapter, it's How to Grow a Million
[SPEAKER_00]: Pounds of Skunk Weed or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're talking about pounds,
UK pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Thomas, I keep wanting to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: My Googler has had a breach right now,
so we'll just keep the conversation
[SPEAKER_07]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite at this point in my life is
Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to sort through a lot of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you learn where the reliable sources
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see one of their articles pop
up, and most of the time, I think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably referencing all these great
books.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: And guys, if you read some stuff on
Google, read three or four articles on
[SPEAKER_07]: Google.
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go smoke a fat joint and call one of your
grower friends or Twitter somebody here on
[SPEAKER_07]: the show and say, hey, I just got this
high idea and I want to try this crazy
[SPEAKER_07]: shit to my plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of us on the show, usually we're
pretty friendly folk.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you catch us at the right time,
we'll answer your emails.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes me a minute, y'all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_07]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com, iGrowCulture
on Twitter, iGrowCulture on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel free to message me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go to the iRegenetics Colorado
website and go to the forum.
[SPEAKER_07]: Create an account, log in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I make it a point to answer those
questions there personally, because that
[SPEAKER_07]: is my forum.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel responsible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So log in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Create an account.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll answer all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if not, my buddy Tony, or Cut Proof,
or Goodroll, or somebody in there will
[SPEAKER_07]: help you out really soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good way to learn a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be leery of information from a lot of
forums, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any names,
but there's two specific ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been banned from two forums for
talking shit about people saying the wrong
[SPEAKER_07]: shit on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm OK with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can ban me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, fuck those guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to do stuff wrong and I
say that's bullshit and you ban me,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're supporting bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So ban me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to play anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't need to shut up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to say its name,
but I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm banned from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am banned the fuck from that website.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it's twisting a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So phenotypes, I should mention.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to turn the music down just a
touch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm yelling.
[SPEAKER_07]: The phenotypes, just to make you guys a
little familiar, Girl Scout Cookies is a
[SPEAKER_07]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two known phenotypes of Girl
Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody in the room is shaking their
head.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know that forum cut that everybody
has.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the platinum cut that I
guess not everybody has that they brag
[SPEAKER_07]: about having in Cali.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there may be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's why.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the Thin Mint cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The OGKB shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a hybrid or is that the same?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the funky, crazy looking one.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've ever seen pictures of somebody
saying Girl Scout, OGKB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually isn't platinum cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about animal cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad I brought you guys because you
knew some stuff today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, you got me thinking about some
cookies now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a little bit of Girl Scout Cookies
hidden away over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jilly Bean is something super popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: You always hear about that candy store
Fino and the orange Fino.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Chernobyl, the golden ticket Fino.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you grow my golden goat from seed,
you're looking for that golden goat Fino
[SPEAKER_07]: that looks just like mommy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plush Berry, that's a great example.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a Black Cherry Kim phenotype and
then there's the Space Queen dominant
[SPEAKER_07]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Cherry Soda, the phenotype that's
dominant to that is very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll know if you've got it about 20 days
into flower, you can tell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn off the grow lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn on the normal lights and look from
the underside of the calyx and you'll see
[SPEAKER_07]: the purple for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow's got a couple known phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Short said that he put that flow out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He released that clone that's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said he let that out to show everybody
what was possible with those seeds,
[SPEAKER_07]: what the potential of Flow was.
[SPEAKER_07]: That cut that we all have supposedly came
from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've learned a lot of stuff from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that he's doing the free weed
show a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new episode's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, listen to that one, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear a lot of the... I've learned a
lot from just listening to DJ on that show
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's great to hear that he's not
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually... We all thought he was
from Canada for so many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a boot time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not touching that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't make fun of anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got something to say, Spence?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all leaned up on the mic like
you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hand on the trigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to read your questions so
I can think of some shit to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you grow out of a pack, this is why
is variation happening and useful?
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about why it's happening because
we're breeding a male and a female and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're making babies and we don't want
all the babies to look the same in the
[SPEAKER_07]: world.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how plants survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you find that variation to be
useful?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want that stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want the different phenos?
[SPEAKER_05]: Different phenos gives you... We talked
about on a previous episode, we talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about how many phenos you should keep in a
seed pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you would want to keep a
couple of different ones, especially if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a seed pack that is a hybrid or
something like that where you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple variations of your parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy the different variations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants grow faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants have more side branching.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, side branching.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants grow straight up and some
plants actually the bottoms grow almost as
[SPEAKER_05]: good as the top does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the types of plants certain
people look for.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need stuff that clones well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And clones well.
[SPEAKER_05]: My clone game's coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think they did something to the
water around here or something because
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody's clones, everybody that I know
in this circle of growers was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: my clones, bro, my clones, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost trees of clones, small trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: My game's back on like Spence said,
but for a minute there, there were some
[SPEAKER_07]: clone issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all calling each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yo, you got some clones?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all getting back on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was going on?
[SPEAKER_07]: It had to be something in the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like every year this happens
about this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also if you guys are indoor growers in
Colorado, be prepared to be fucked for a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of months because nobody's going to
want to buy your product because I have
[SPEAKER_07]: seen an outdoor crop in every other yard
in Colorado the past few weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been sunny and everyone's out playing
with their trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are hustling.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dispensaries are going to slow down a
little.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe I haven't thought that
would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a dispenser the other day with a
really big outdoor grow looking pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've seen some pictures of that
and that thing looks pretty damn killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really neat greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a lot of really cool fluorescent
lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: I talked about that place on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody's gone by and taken cool
pictures of that greenhouse I talked
[SPEAKER_07]: about, tweet me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was my idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw it the night of Jesse's wedding and
it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really great.
[SPEAKER_07]: How often do you get to do a phenohunt,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as often as I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could grow from seed every single
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have some other plants I have to
maintain and the best way to do that is
[SPEAKER_00]: clone and run clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps reliable medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It keeps reliable medicine for the
patients and that's what we all need.
[SPEAKER_00]: This winter I'm planning on growing pretty
much exclusively seed other than just
[SPEAKER_00]: mother maintenance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever ran a whole pack of seeds
and not gotten anything worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.
You?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your shop's got a nice amount of seeds
going right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you've got high hopes for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of different ones going on
in there too so it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't find a couple of keepers of
each one it's going to feel like a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: work for nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Already it's looking like there's a couple
that are setting themselves apart from the
[SPEAKER_04]: others so it's pretty promising.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many days in are those?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in veg still so how long?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're on day 23 in veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look good in your pictures on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check them out, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks great on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got some stylish glass and some
stylish plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he takes the biggest dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dab competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it just might be a friendly to
personal challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking on an episode, it might have
been the last one, that I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_07]: the gigantic dab thing to a rest for
myself because I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how you feel.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is rough.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes a little bit of effort and if you
do it in the mid afternoon and you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: plan it right you could ruin your whole
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only so many times you can do a
gram dab and survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what I actually said was that my
lungs, I've realized my lungs have so many
[SPEAKER_07]: inhales and exhales and I think taking a
gram dab it's just like you're just using
[SPEAKER_07]: up cat lives when you do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was 32 breaths you could have had but
instead you smoked a gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well if you're going to waste 32 breaths.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't waste any breasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean which better way to do it than
taking a hit of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least you weren't breathing in concrete
dust or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I've done that before and I think
I do prefer the dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely prefer the dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: While that music got really loud for a
second that might have been my fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys want to give a shout out to
this hash that we're hitting here?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's subsulmentless.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good work guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Off the haline honey hole even.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Spence for bringing the
haline honey hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: This conversation has gotten off track
because I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else do we want to talk about about
phenotypes you guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay I got a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are bag seeds considered?
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeds you find in mostly S1s I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you don't know the parent yeah it's
probably just an S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well you know the parent if you get the
seeds out of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't know what the male was
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever heard of plants like
slightly herming and seeding?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then taking the seed from there and
growing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would that be?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an S1.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how Soma, sorry Soma I'm spilling
your beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how Soma actually makes feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: He takes a female and flowers her for too
long.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after she goes like if you got a
nine week strain he lets it go for 13 and
[SPEAKER_07]: about week 13 it'll start spitting out
pollen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he gathers that and throws it on
the next crop that he makes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then he says he can smoke those buds too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he can cut down most of the plant
just leaving enough of it to herm out and
[SPEAKER_07]: spit out pollen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then he can smoke the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you can't smoke it you can
definitely probably extract it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of his fire technique?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah heat stress to kick the plants
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little weird to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I understand the theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where he's coming from with the forest
fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: His method is more organic than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty hardcore.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to smoke the flowers of the
plants that I have reversed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to smoke those.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can smoke his.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah you don't want to smoke mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I would.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been sprayed with chemicals that I
don't trust smoking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: ChemDog was bag seed guys so don't ever
doubt bag seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean I've seen some great bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had some crazy looking stuff from bag
seeds and whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could be an F2.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could experience transgressive
segregation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could outperform its parents.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will because you don't know what the
parents were.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to outperform them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the person who was managing the room
could have a good idea what the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people on Instagram sell packs
of S1s for a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those forum sites I saw a pack of
S1s go for like freaking eight grand one
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen some old seeds go for ridiculous
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some OG rascal stuff in a forum.
[SPEAKER_07]: Went for a really high price recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I went to Cali I met up with another
person through Instagram and stuff and
[SPEAKER_05]: they had the original fire OG cut from
rascal and they said it was 20 G's is how
[SPEAKER_05]: much it cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an expensive clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an expensive clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you dabbing over there Buster?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have it it's worth it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a little bit of lemon cookies
from JP Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lemon cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to JP Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a lot of good things about that
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh Spence you're ringing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cancel it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah if you're up in the springs check
them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got pretty good extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna try to cut that out of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry that's a torch you guys if you're
wondering.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time for me to take a dab too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna take a sip of something and take
a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody got anything snazzy to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers to good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snazzy weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got anything longer to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you working on any breeding projects
right now Jesse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got going on in your project?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am like I was saying I'm really happy
with BX3 of Depot Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm gonna make a whole bunch of
seed of it and maybe get it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a way you can make that happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them what the cross is on the Depot
Dog again so they can get them excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old school Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a whole lot of
heritage on it but it's a I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: producer of it but it was a skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was a freebie from an old
Amsterdam seed pack but had really really
[SPEAKER_00]: early resin production and it was a skunk
haze so the initial reason I used it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cross was he was very different than
Kim D and it was very easy to spot out the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that were leaning harder
towards him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of used it as a tool to make the
Kim line more pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad that Kim was discovered.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a legit Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a Kim 4 back pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim D even.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody out there that's got a killer Kim
or Kim 4, Kim D for Jesse?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can trade.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can trade.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Colorado and you're an adult
we can do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can find some seeds or something
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pretty cool Girl Scout cookies
for that cookie still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got the Gorilla Glue 4 and I've got
Platinum OG so let's talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if ours are the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Gorilla Glue's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah we should trade cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious because there's different
phenotypes of that isn't there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah there's a more sour diesel-y one and
then there's one that has more of that
[SPEAKER_05]: chocolate tie that's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Girl Scout?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've moved on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should make Girl Glue.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should breed those bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout Glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's like a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sourdub chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very lanky.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can already tell in bench that those
bitches are lanky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah those clothes are taller than
everybody else already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I've seen are pretty easy to
point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real bushy and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I guess bushy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bushy lankiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: They grow with more vigor than a lot of
the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like a rose plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a text coming in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse's phone is not really advanced is
the word.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may be an antique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half years in the phone world
that's an antique.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of makes a lot of weird noises.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah that was a good rant about Finos
because that Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the other number?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's four and what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just four is all I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a seven or a three or some
shit that I've heard about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need cuts of that one so we can compare
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys find us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to try that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a lot of great shit for trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be bringing Tangy to Southern
Colorado soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the Tang because there's a strain that
everyone calls the Tang that is not Tangy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't taste like any goddamn tangerines
or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero oranges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why'd you call that the Tang?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's flow.
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty close.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's flow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit trying to front.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you growing now bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: Platinum Cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moonshine Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies and Cream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's cookie crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies and Cream.
[SPEAKER_05]: That won the cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And whoever took that name, Cookies and
Cream, I wanted that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anybody ever smoked Starfighter?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Starfighter F2.
It's a bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I figured.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starfighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Rare Dinkness or is that... Exotic
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Exotic Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about that packet
seed that's out there for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that and then Enzo's Kush is what I've
got going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have a Fino Hunt going right
now by the way, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, if you have timers that have
more than one program, make sure you go
[SPEAKER_05]: through your programs and make sure
there's no extra timers chilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can catch it, but I caught it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you almost flower?
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you almost flower your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost unflowered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost unflowered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had it like, well, I was,
my room, some plants look good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's, I saw a wrong timer,
but it was just weird because there was no
[SPEAKER_05]: off timer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've been in my room and it's not on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume with those fancy digital timers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you reset your timer guy,
just reset it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, just hit reset and clear it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't just try to go and reset everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually hit the button, default that
bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think they'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a couple that are just growing
right through it and it didn't matter to
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of happy with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: What light cycle are you running?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing the 12-12 or the 11-13?
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-12.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a good way to stress test
your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was mentioning this, this is a,
since our phenotopic kind of got side
[SPEAKER_07]: railed here, we ran out of shit to talk
about, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I stress test my plants before I breed
with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take a female and put her in a room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've got four or five new clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put them in the room and I'll run it
on 12-12 for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then about day 15, I'll turn it off
for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Day 15, I'll turn it on for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll put it back on the opposite
12-12.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I was coming on at 10 in the
morning, now I'm coming on at 10 at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll run that for a few more days,
you know, and just watch them grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll kind of freak out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll put it back into the normal
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that really pisses off normal plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you will see a lot of things start to
throw nanners and become a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see which ones really are true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't breed with them if they throw
those bananas on you, because those are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be hermaphrodites in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same goes for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to give away too many
secrets, so we'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, male stuff is all, that's all
proprietary stuff that you keep on the
[SPEAKER_07]: down-low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, give them that at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people breeding with a bunch
of hermed ass males.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, or the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can usually spot a nice hermed male.
[SPEAKER_07]: The top clusters are too close together
and they look like they got fur between
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They start to look like a pussy willow or
something, a foxtail sort of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a nice hermed out male.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tell by that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just want those big juicy balls.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will never say that ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about what kind of traits we
look for in a male in another episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse will come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we totally, I guess, will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like on episode 500, once everyone's
listened for a long time and loves us.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing over there,
Spence?
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks dangerous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just being a pyro.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is fire and plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just puts it down like, I already know
how this shit ends.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ends with us outside staring at the house
going, that sucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been going for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been at it for 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys got anything you want to talk
about on a podcast?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you've ever wanted to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone just kind of shakes their head
and goes, nah, bro, we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have one side note back to the feno
hunting thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good, because that's what everybody
came to this show for.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the notes say.
[SPEAKER_04]: One big thing I look for is I grow mostly
indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like to have plants that respond well
to topping and supercropping so I can get
[SPEAKER_04]: a nice even canopy versus having a lot of
lower growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certain strains really don't like
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a very phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_07]: So things like purpling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even some strains, because if you have an
unhealthy plant, they'll have purple
[SPEAKER_00]: stems, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have seen healthy plants that just
have purple stems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl Scout Cookies purples up completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl Scout Cookies gets black and gets
purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a black leaf company or black
leaf society.
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is, black leaf society.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have had a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of cookie shots.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might find some of my cookies on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think some of all of ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spence had something really great to say
and then backed up from the microphone and
[SPEAKER_07]: backed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or nah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or nah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to say it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: The notes are done, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've said all the stuff on my notes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking over here like,
what can we say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had some you're thinking?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can press pause while you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be scared to kill your red hair
buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael's taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, don't be afraid to kill off those
plants that are not performing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I do phenotypes or both pheno hunts,
I usually do probably a couple seed packs,
[SPEAKER_05]: not just one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of survival of the fittest
for me because seeds, I like to not really
[SPEAKER_05]: feed them too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like to just let them see which
ones are going to do their thing until I
[SPEAKER_05]: have to start giving them food.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, like I kill ones that if it's
going to get overgrown as a seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's probably going to get overgrown as a
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just get rid of it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's nothing wrong with getting rid
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just makes your hunt smaller and more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can focus on other things instead
of now you have one less plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like picking players for the team.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want those slow runners or the
guy that can't shoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want me on your team.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a lot of Spence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take me on your team.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can block, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stand right in front of the hoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just both of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just right in front of the hoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're both about six, five issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're wondering why we're talking
about sports on a weed podcast events,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing a secret cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should be at the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm going with a low cab.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that should be a good time when I think
that September 27th, 28th.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good because I had something else
going on at September.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you're playing with that carb cap,
we're going to give a huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_07]: the man Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: These blue carb caps.
[SPEAKER_07]: These new colored titanium pieces are
dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all don't even know about this shit
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got that new, new.
[SPEAKER_07]: This episode's coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're pre-recording this one because I was
out of town when we should have recorded
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, we're pre-recording, but,
uh, this stuff is new and they look good,
[SPEAKER_07]: bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: The color is not coming off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's looks just like the other carb caps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good work, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Task Rock and highly educated
titanium.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, uh, it's not anodized,
is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the word, but I'm not
certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it with heat and change the color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't it turn like a rainbow color when
you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a little more variation in it,
I believe, if that was the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask him so that way, uh, we know
since, uh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if that's anodized, I mean,
I have no doubt Task is, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out top quality shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a very high quality
anodization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anodizing process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen so many people that look like
Task lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like people are dressing up like
Task.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yo, is that Task?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just jeans and a t-shirt,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not really an outfit or a costume.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a good size dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that's a big old water hashtag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, I'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to let Spence go ahead and heat
up the honey hole for me, the Halen honey
[SPEAKER_07]: hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, thanks for bearing with a bunch
of potheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we tried to have a phenotype
discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like we covered a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can, uh, name off any
other, uh, famous phenotypes or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even some of your own, uh, Heart of
Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's got a real, um, starbursty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a more of a question, but I'm growing
out a Grape Samparogi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And does anyone know of any popular
phenotype variation of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one that actually tastes real
Grapey that Spence loves, uh, a super
[SPEAKER_07]: Grapey phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it almost looks, when the buds start
to grow, they're real dense and they look
[SPEAKER_07]: furry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, there's, yeah, that's the one
that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_07]: A whole lot of hairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: A whole lot of, uh, not even more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, kind of trichome and just,
it's got a real rigid structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just looks real crazy in the texture of
the buds themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys, I won't be talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully one of these guys covers the
dead airspace while I take this dab and
[SPEAKER_07]: then I'll correct the radio silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of us just looked at each other
like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff totally leads the conversation for
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have any of you guys ever had seeds that
you grew and didn't take clones on?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it ended up being like some really,
really good shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of us have experienced that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on for the stab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many fish in the ocean,
but yeah, that's, I lost a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, alien dog phenome that was really
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real sad about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from a private breeder though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the, uh, alien dog that,
um, that is from a very popular breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I recently lost my, uh, flow strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone in this room has that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get it back, but what am I going
to have to get up now?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I had, uh, I grew DNA genetics,
holy grail Kush from seed and it was fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys are looking for a dank,
stinky Kush, that's mostly indica that'll
[SPEAKER_07]: just set you down and tastes like stinky,
skunky feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bitch to grow and it will not
clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I try, I gave cuts to other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't get it to clone,
but that stuff was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: The DNA genetics, holy grail Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a pack of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, uh, he just released a whole
bunch of them, I think, but I had a limit
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, uh, from, uh, from Arian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to name them, but hey,
it was a good phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought she had the DNA one,
but, uh, I think they're pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So would, no, this is a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we still recording?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still totally recording.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna ask a stupid question anyway,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do the NC.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll know it's over.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it is a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So OGs are not a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are like, it would be a genome type.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, lately I think OG is just a sticker
used by a dispensary or a seed breeder for
[SPEAKER_07]: dollar signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well put.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say every true OGs like the,
you know, uh, yeah, the original ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the story, there's a bunch of
different phenotypes of the genotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, underdog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I really think there's two
underdogs and both of them are pretty well
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys got to speak in an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to shout out another podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did an episode all about OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went up today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not had a chance to listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not on iTunes right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having a little problem,
but, uh, you can listen to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's iCannabisRadio.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recorded shows on iCannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those guys talk about a lot of great
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On YouTube is the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Adam Dunn and Mitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably don't listen to our show
because they have their own, but,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, they get a lot of cool guests on
because they're in Denver and because
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam's got a seed company that is very
well known from Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mitch seems to be, pretty well
connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mitch has a new book out, which is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out Mitch Shinasa's new book,
the Cannabis Aficionados Handbook,
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: My pothead memory just pulled that out of
no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to remember pothead things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever grown any TH seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, not actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I grew sage and sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a freebie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've heard that called old man's
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't ever a fan of the sage and it won
cups.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's an acronym, but it does have
a, uh, a sagey, uh, taste to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's mental probably now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's, everybody says that probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it is, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Kush and I haven't, I'd say I've
never smoked it like a true cam or a
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really good sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I smoked some sours, but not like there's
a sour diesel cut that goes around here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you smoked any of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I grew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew it and I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, there wasn't a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be looking for a different soury,
you know, taste, but I've had,
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I work where I work at.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one still haven't smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good for a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the G diesel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you'll like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll love that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's done well, that stuff is,
you know, actually the, uh, my friend Josh
[SPEAKER_07]: from La Plata labs rolled a joint of that
shit one night at a party and there were a
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of breeders in the room and they all
gathered around that joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for a bunch of breeders to jump up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that your joint?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no, no, it was not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was, uh, I was hoping to hear that Fino
was more of a SoCo thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually that was Durango is where
they're from.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out La Plata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been back in 13 years,
regrettably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, every summer I plan a trip over there
and never happens, but, um, I'm totally
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cruise through the shop when I do
get over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to do it being an outdoor
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse brought me some eggs and,
uh, I cracked open one of those eggs and
[SPEAKER_07]: it almost freaked me out because the
yolk... Was it not crazy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like just two times, three times
the size it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would think it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they taste so much better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like store eggs make me nauseous when I
eat them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Oh God, I can't believe I decided to
cook this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's factory farming too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse's eggs taste like food and it seemed
like I was supposed to be eating it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he brought me tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, after eating Jesse's
tomatoes, I can't even go buy a tomato
[SPEAKER_07]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I got food in Denver the other night
and they came with fresh tomatoes and I
[SPEAKER_07]: bit into the tomatoes and they taste like
soggy mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I am spoiled by Jesse's organic
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a deli downtown called Schlepp's
that has my produce there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to them, bomb ass food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy local produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on main street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I launched a bingo burger today
and someone is supplying them with some
[SPEAKER_00]: bomb ass fucking produce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bingo burger usually does pretty well.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good place to eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a free commercial for bingo
burger from a bunch of potheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a vegetarian, get that,
uh, that mushroom burger.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: You eat fish?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've said that I won't eat fish
anymore recently, but I may.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you got in mind?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just asking.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a bang and a salmon burger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I ordered it, I was like,
I ordered it and I was like, hold up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to go ask them if it's a filet or
if it's like, like a patty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yo, is this a patty?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like salmon patty?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, no, it's a filet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that on the menu today, but I
already decided what I was going to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Green onions, avocado, tomato,
lettuce, pesto sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you get like a whole wheat grain
bun.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody listening right now,
I just got the munchies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been all taking dabs and talking
about growing wheat and now Spence just
[SPEAKER_07]: killed everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where all the best food in Pueblo
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the pot heads know where to eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a vegetarian, there's like four
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel bad for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cook for the vegetarian?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally makes you just cook at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me want to open a vegetarian
restaurant though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of us would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put a little section in the back where
nobody can see what I'm doing back there
[SPEAKER_07]: and don't bother me between bringing me
plates of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The office.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just call the place the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be hard to, in the winter,
it'd be hard for me to have a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restaurant because I'd just be so
disappointed by the produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And organic vegetables would be really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if we could grow some vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's probably one of the
downsides of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you want to build a greenhouse,
there's certain you're going to grow wheat
[SPEAKER_07]: in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like $1 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my retirement plan is, but not for
full of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, flowers, vegetables,
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally had something I was going to say
we should talk about and just forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, have you guys ever grown any produce
inside?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not inside myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like actually like fully ran it
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it inside like to start seed and
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But besides that, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say I did the little like
window side herbs and things like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but nothing other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done real basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce, basil, tried a tomato plant one
time and it was taking up room.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it got put outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've grown some great shit outdoors,
but never inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's growing an outdoor vegetable crop for
yourself is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're eating a meal and you're like,
I grew 90% of the stuff in this meal right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I knew how to make tortillas,
man, I would be self-reliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure learning how to make a tortilla.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smith's is looking at me like he's going
to make tortillas.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be over all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, we've almost gone for an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet if I put commercials on this thing,
an intro and an outro and a big shout out
[SPEAKER_07]: to Task Rock, I bet I can make this a nice
even hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys got anything fancy to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I've asked that once, but we've
rambled on for a few minutes since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to a chick on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 710 nurse or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She replied to the shout out for the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up hippie nurse 710?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a loyal listener.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually know that person in person and
we give her a lot of girl advice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know she shouted you out on the
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, chick?
[SPEAKER_00]: She let me know that she's listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: She certainly is.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got some outdoor stuff going on that
looks pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she could.
[SPEAKER_07]: She puts pictures of it on fucking
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't just call her out on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might give her advice on that once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any shout outs over there, dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all looking into your phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spence, shout outs, plugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: She just turned 21.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're finally old enough to go where we
can all go now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to iRogenetics, Jeff,
Jesse, Michael, anybody that's ever been
[SPEAKER_05]: on the show that's not here or anybody
that supports the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for supporting the show for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus, you gave me a shout out and I got
four new followers while you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the whole Garden of Weeden
crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Fong way out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the guys in other states.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to call out their states,
but even if I met you once or twice in
[SPEAKER_07]: your Garden of Weeden crew, I know who you
are still.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are events in Denver on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thursday, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, tonight we're doing a podcast while
they're kicking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to say everybody get out
in the community and start enjoying,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the atmosphere of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because Colorado is a special
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like other states, you can't do what we
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we've got places where we
can just go mingle and eat and hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, instead of getting drunk,
we're taking dads and smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you live here, go enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, you know, if you're up to it,
if not, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're in the community,
go enjoy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, come out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to be a certain type of
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody judges anybody there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all happy people that all like to
smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come taste some amazing herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come see what your herb can be grown like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come meet a grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come meet a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to come out, just don't
mess it up for everyone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to learn how to, you know,
behave yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're too high for crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just kind of just kick it and smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't try to come take a gigantic dab and
fall over and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol in these vins don't really seem to
mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it's ever been a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very little alcohol consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just for the cotton mouth most of the
time, but it's usually a fruity drink if
[SPEAKER_07]: you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this episode won't go out until the
start of next month.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be kind of busy for a couple of
times here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're pre-recording, but look for us at
events guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're easy to find.
[SPEAKER_07]: We usually post it up on Facebook or
Instagram when we're going somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I was going to say it's at Jesse
grows on Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, Jesse at Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to adjust some stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that even happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't care, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Twitter Peyton on your shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's at Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out Colorado Bearded Dabbers on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's her buddy Michael over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get him on the show more cause he's
got a lot of good shit to say and people
[SPEAKER_07]: are always better on the show after the
second or third time.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out Garden of Weed N on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: He posts a lot of great pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also make sure you check out at I read
genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I post a lot of weed pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been posting and trying to broaden my
spectrum of type of pictures I post.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait till the camera man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, the camera will change
your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you can listen, you can take,
imagine all the pictures you can take your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants, but then there's like dad pictures
you can take.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's all types.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some, like if you want to get a
guy that once I buy it, you're not going
[SPEAKER_07]: to see me for like a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be like, where are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like taking pictures, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Want to come over and get your pictures
taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, but you may have convinced me to
just drive to Best Buy and go pick that
[SPEAKER_07]: shit up pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I really want one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on my Christmas list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on my wedding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you could just wait till Black Friday
and you could probably catch my first
[SPEAKER_05]: deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the first one to say that it's
kind of, it's kind of far off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I need to support Black
Friday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the epitome of America.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cyber Monday sounds dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, speaking of that, uh, Hygro is,
uh, Hygro Supply is about to launch a
[SPEAKER_00]: nationwide website, uh, with this shipping
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have our, uh, actually I think
the prices are going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lower than they are in the store,
but nationwide shipping and everyone can
[SPEAKER_00]: get great deals like we get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I believe there'll be an in-store
pickup program too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the, uh, the tote of soil deal is now
over you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't buy one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where would I, where would you,
where are you going to put that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold a couple, but I never even saw
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wanting to see it, but I never even
saw it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was how many gallons as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was, uh, I said it would fill
48, seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have got one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was gonna last me a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I don't need the, I can't,
you, if you got the right spot,
[SPEAKER_07]: you could do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Reuse, recycle, reduce, reuse,
recycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the tote bag it came in, uh,
I really want one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow some stuff in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a huge one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's great for recycling soil in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say, make a great compost pile
or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys, we got three minutes
before it's an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to wrap up the show.

into when he came here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wish y'all knew how crazy I looked,
but you don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take some pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll post them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take pictures and show everybody how
crazy you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes he wears a grill.
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't have the grill in today.
[SPEAKER_07]: When he wears the grill, white people get
nervous.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to a wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maxed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear a wedding grill story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard one of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the normal people that were more
normal were Spence and Matty and myself
[SPEAKER_07]: and Slop and Big Mike were walking through
the crowd and they kind of looked and they
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't sure if we were there to steal
everyone's purse or if we were friends of
[SPEAKER_07]: the groom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone says they're the black sheep of
their family.
[SPEAKER_07]: You proved it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You proved it.
