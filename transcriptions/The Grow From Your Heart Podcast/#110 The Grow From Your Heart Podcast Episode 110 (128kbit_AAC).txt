[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 110 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are having a great
evening, afternoon, morning, whatever time
[SPEAKER_01]: it is, wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're hanging out, getting some
turps in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're smoking a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got a vaporizer packed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got the e-nail turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're eating some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be smoking a blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're smoking a blunt,
more power to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them turps in your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set yourself free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is going to be a great
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the episode that I recorded in
Colorado Springs from the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_01]: Invitational.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great folks in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode features the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode features Chris from the Clear
Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it definitely features a whole bunch
of lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to that, this podcast is
brought to you by our great friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting over here hitting the Hitman
mini sidecar with the hammerhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed this one because it's got a
yellow label on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't seen a lot of Hitman with a
yellow label on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it looked fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hammerhead perk in this thing,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, this thing hits like a fucking
boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to heat this up for a second
here while I'm rambling about Hitman
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I have to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to heat this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a fat dab of some
Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin from the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a dab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this podcast is brought to you by our
good friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm shopping for a rig, you guys,
I want a rig that I know is going to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: like a truck that's not going to splash
water in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want a rig made by an American
in America and not made by some Chinese
[SPEAKER_01]: kid without protective eyewear,
with no shoes, and not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, I represent Hitman Glass by
Glass Made in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman Glass is a huge part of the
cannabis and hash movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out www.hitmanglass

[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Hitman Glass Dougie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were in California this summer,
definitely make sure you check out the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chalice Festival in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This nail is hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nice and turped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Hitman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys support the Hitman
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot to Dougie and the entire
Hitman fam for supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I don't have a lot else to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's time travel back a few days to
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it was a lovely, snowy
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a bunch of lovely ladies in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a bunch of turpy dudes in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a table covered in great food
and good hash and good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let the music take us right into
that part of the episode, and then I'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: back to wrap up the show after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your boy Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here in beautiful Colorado Springs
looking out a giant window, looking at a
[SPEAKER_01]: lovely day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's snowing like a son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gorgeous out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting across from me, you guys,
I am here at the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_01]: Invitational, and sitting across from me
is the lovely dude, it's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: And really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds and looks like the weed that I
grew is working for the whole house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've all been stone silly for four days
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our friend Brittany is joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's known as Dude It's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her real name is Brittany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for being on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, of course, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: She brought four or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even count how many lovely ladies
there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: She brought four beautiful model friends
with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to go from the left and
introduce all the ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting to my left is Miss Amanda.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they call you on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ackley Rocks, R-A-W-K-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk to you a little bit
more later, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass the mic for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you've got a mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give you a mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really high, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hide it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting in front of me is my new friend,
Shayna.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm just Shayna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Shayna?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an Instagram you want to shout
out?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a great photographer, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has taken some great pictures this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, we'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give everybody a heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out Instagram,
hashtag DudeIt'sGatsby, and look at some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pictures that are posted there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might enjoy some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting at my noon position here is
Tristan.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your Instagram handle so people can
stalk you while they're listening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tristan Renee is my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you spell Renee at the end there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: R-E-N-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real special.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are special.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting way to my right-ish is this shy
girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we call you Jacqueline?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we call you Jackie?
[SPEAKER_06]: Jacqueline, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacqueline, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your Instagram, honey?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my name is underscore Jacqueline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow her, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's taken some great pictures this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're super stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, who's got to grab his mic,
blow out his dab, get his shit together,
[SPEAKER_01]: cough a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my buddy, John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hanging out, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my buddy, the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the man, the myth, the turpgather,
the legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm faded, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took the biggest dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so stupid blowing out right now,
and I'm trying to talk without coughing
[SPEAKER_00]: and hacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cough on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show will be filled with coughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a gorgeous house, a gorgeous
location, some gorgeous friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in the room, you guys, we're going to
do another podcast after this,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll feature these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also in the room, we got Jordan from
Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our buddy, Dan, from CCC420.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my left, my new friend, Chris,
from The Clear, The Clear Scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for jumping in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a show with all these
guys here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may get the guitar out again,
if you guys remember what happened on that
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a little turp sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of notes here on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably open that stuff up and
start getting on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, before we get too far, I need to
learn a little bit about the Dude It's
[SPEAKER_01]: Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys want to tell me all about
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been organizing these shoot fests for
a few years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to do it for a different company
where I would bring a bunch of girls and
[SPEAKER_10]: photographers to different locations.
[SPEAKER_10]: We would make a whole bunch of art and
have a really good time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an excuse for all of us to get
together, even though we are spread across
[SPEAKER_10]: the country.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought, why not do that for cannabis
products and for businesses?
[SPEAKER_10]: I ran the idea past Hunt and he was like,
that could actually happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just an idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't it be cool?
[SPEAKER_10]: I really just wanted an excuse to bring my
friends somewhere and watch them run
[SPEAKER_10]: around naked.
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said that we could make it a real thing
and lots of hard work and planning and
[SPEAKER_10]: some sweet sponsors later.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of these guys here teach me how to
be a boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already knew how to be a boss before I
met you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think lifestyle marketing and content
creation in general is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous businesses, whether big or small,
are utilizing in different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Gigi Fam and different aspects,
I actually met Damsel at one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were giving cannabis class to the photo
shoot and doing some cannabis consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the people that are in the room now,
there's a massive imprint and footprint on
[SPEAKER_00]: how social media and social engineering
and lifestyle marketing comes to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a double-edged sword with bringing
the right people together, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the right brands together to be
able to represent what Damsel does really
[SPEAKER_00]: well and what we can put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: What brands were part of the event this
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the first event you guys have done
like this?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first of its kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who joined on for this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can rattle them off pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all deserve a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all kinds of different companies
came to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, iReGenetics had a nice part
with some of the stuff we've been putting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the air for the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecana came through with a bunch of
great holistic topicals that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also having some great shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turbex is an unbelievable sponsor that not
only has done all the stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsoring the vehicles to other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clear concentrate as well as their
whole subsidiary of brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that popcorn?
[SPEAKER_01]: That popcorn from the clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I went like a thousand milligrams
deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I slept like an infant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I think something's moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked and I was like, my hand's on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's something moving?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wait, that's me just trembling
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep it together as I'm
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clear came through huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris coming out in person is a blessing
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just having out the scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mood mats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mood mats came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent out a box of rubber that you
could literally wear as a jacket and stay
[SPEAKER_00]: warm for the whole winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mats that can cover that coffee table
right there that we're staring at and all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clicking at your mom's table all sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some places there that we shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw what was going down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are what other ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people that are here, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ladies and their brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the ladies that traveled.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was a huge success.
[SPEAKER_10]: We brought out a bunch of veteran models
and a veteran photographer and girls that
[SPEAKER_10]: are really used to pitching in and doing
their share of the work and helping out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all get along really well, but we know
how to work really hard to get the job
[SPEAKER_10]: done.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of play.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had a really great group of girls
that are really good friends spread across
[SPEAKER_10]: the country.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we get together, it's like nothing
changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep talking about friends from across
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is everybody in the room from?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Shayna?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opposite ends of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tristan?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Bellflower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from Chicago, but just moved to
Phoenix three months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that for a change?
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to ride your bike more?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This young lady rides a Harley,
and she looks awesome doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to you and your bike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard for me to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude, it's Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of words for my stonest to
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out for letting me be a part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, the snow is coming down again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is such a great view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the people that let us use
this house.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a dope house.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that really made this
weekend special, Miss Danzel actually
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to blame this mostly on Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few months ago, Hunt put me in touch
with Miss Danzel and she asked me if I
[SPEAKER_01]: would breed a strain for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what's been going on this weekend
is we have all been smoking what will
[SPEAKER_01]: become or possibly not become from what
the talk has been, some things that may
[SPEAKER_01]: become Danzel's dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a little notebook in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys decided which is your
favorite and least favorites and such?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the overwhelming favorite is what
ladies?
[SPEAKER_10]: B4.
[SPEAKER_01]: B4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an echo in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: B4 is the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had judging competitions and
being a part of a lot of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously putting you all together is
great stuff for us to all flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a veteran rule in doing this,
but the one that's gone first is always
[SPEAKER_00]: the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that everybody smoked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: B4 was gone first the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: B4 was gone first this time with the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some more B4 in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to throw some on the counter
before I leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the people that didn't get a chance to
smoke it, can you describe what you
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of B4 since you've got your notes
right in front of you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it smelled a little bit like
pineapple with a hint of citrus,
[SPEAKER_10]: but the taste was a little bit more ... I
was so high when I did this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I drew a campfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see it on her page.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it was a little bit floral with a
hint of birch and then it was naturey.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it kind of tasted like camping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: It had some nice orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was frosty.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been lots of giggles, lots of good
times.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bitches love B4.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I call you guys the bitches for the
length of the show and I'll stop right
[SPEAKER_01]: after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you have to have tits to use that
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked and I got totally denied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found my boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to smoke more B4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to smoke more B4.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anybody else in the room get a
campfire or tastes like camping aroma?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's kind of a chef.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't you a chef?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been cooking the entire time I've
been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time you haven't been
cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say it does kind of taste like
campfire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a good way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I think of campfire,
I think like when you go camping and your
[SPEAKER_01]: hair smells like campfire, not like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just because everything stays in
your hair.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what kind of dreadlock joke is that,
mama?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a mic if you're going to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're loud enough to where they kind of
got you, but it heard you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So B4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a runner up?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also really enjoyed the A3.
[SPEAKER_01]: A3.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I thought it smelled like fruity
pebbles, a little bit like black cheese.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit of cherry, but it tasted a
little more diesel-y.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that one had super sparkly turps on
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I described the overall high as sway
feels, you know, when you like get super
[SPEAKER_10]: high and you just like start swaying in
the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of leaning just back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just kind of leaning to the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't pick where your feet want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This weighs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does anybody want to know what was in
these crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know all the boys in the room are
staring at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going, tell me what's in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been waiting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was fun to mess with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anybody try any of the number,
the letter C?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did any of that get tasted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that dookie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we all agree that was just dookie and
I shouldn't grow that anymore?
[SPEAKER_10]: We just didn't even write anything down.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was no good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there were three that were from
that selection and I didn't bring them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I did this, I ran, I think I
started with 20 seeds of three different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and I narrowed it down through the
veg phase and through flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up with a three of letter A and I
just labeled the seeds so that nobody knew
[SPEAKER_01]: what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just, this is brand A,
this is brand B, this is brand C.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had three of letter A, four of B,
and three of C.
[SPEAKER_01]: C's are dookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to grow any more of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it all away.
[SPEAKER_01]: C was transformer to daybreaker from Gage
Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transformers Inferno Haze and Chem D and
then the, what's the other one I said it
[SPEAKER_01]: is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm lost now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Inferno Haze and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many genetics in my head that I get
confused, but the winners are- Terp Nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am kind of a Terp Nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A is Space Queen crossed to Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a female Space Queen and a male,
a reversed male Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a feminized seed, but it's Space
Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the A3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Queen to Grateful Dog is what that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's my Space Queen or my Grateful Dog
that I made to sub cool Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real tall stretchy phenotype of the
Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that fruity, funky moldy
smell comes from is this Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the Romulan that makes it grow
those orange, real orange pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real fingery calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from Romulan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So B, the one that everybody loves,
everybody's guessed it so many times
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Lemon Skunk from Arian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Greenhouse Seeds Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Arian's from Lemon Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's crossed to the Daybreaker
from Gage Green Genetics with the Joseph O
[SPEAKER_01]: .G.
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Chem D in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what that one is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Skunk and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a good name if it's- So what I've
heard, you might not decide that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be the keeper.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they were all super,
super good, but I feel like there's just
[SPEAKER_10]: another strain that I compare all of my
highs to and- Don't say the name of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're going to keep that secret
and do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should try to put that in
the mix and maybe do the process over.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean- I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: There were so many good- What was the B1?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was another really, really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: B1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Lemon Skunk Daybreaker Cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the B's will be Lemon Skunk to
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the A's are Grateful Dog and
Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the C's were Trash.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ones that you guys really liked,
we're going to work on getting those on
[SPEAKER_01]: the shelf at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the A3.
[SPEAKER_01]: A3, we'll get that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B4, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: B1 is super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked B1.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Finos all came out fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Turpee Boys are across the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I said B1, I got two thumbs ups
on the B1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be some new stuff showing up
at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a couple of Harvey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it all got smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kudos to you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for some nice fire to smoke for
the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made some amazing, amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched all these ladies be really
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they don't smoke like the
Colorado folk do, they come and get
[SPEAKER_01]: wrecked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making fun of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Turpee Boys have just been
smoking all the B1 and B4 like champions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you write?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your notes?
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so Jacqueline over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: She did her own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they call you dimples or is it dampels?
[SPEAKER_10]: She's getting so shy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jacqueline did her own notes for the
B4.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was when we smoked it at Jack's
apartment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she was already really high.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, write down how you feel.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just for appearance, she wrote green.
[SPEAKER_10]: Potency, she wrote good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Taste, she wrote tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Creative.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just giggling at her notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's all blushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more notes that we could go over,
unless anybody has more stuff to say about
[SPEAKER_01]: this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about what's up with that
Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is B4?
[SPEAKER_00]: How high does it get?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did it yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: So B1 and B, all of the B's were very,
very similar in growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could barely see a difference in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon skunk makes them stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stretch pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow real dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow real chunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could take 70 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: These went 63.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could have gone another week,
but I was pressed for time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the A?
[SPEAKER_01]: The A was done at eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finished at eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them started to herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably see it if you guys are
experienced weed growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got one of the top buds,
you could see herm flowers in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember which one it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took pictures and marked it down in the
photos and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't remember off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I marked down which one was a herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one brought in the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: The most?
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: B1.
[SPEAKER_01]: B1 brought in just, yeah, there was most
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They harvested about an ounce and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: B1 was about two and a half ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So B1 is the keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got another rasta on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what your favorite strain is,
basically, Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You figured that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to cross something of mine to
that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our friends in the room actually
have a clone of your favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've given me blessings to work with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to make you a new strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winnie Lady's coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa help.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody's.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to take me, let's see,
120.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even shitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get the clone that you want me
to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make it a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn it into a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to collect pollen from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to put pollen on another
clone of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm also going to put pollen on
nine other bitches in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to grow those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll smoke a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like a really good plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like three harvests pretty much,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus some curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a whole bunch of
stuff growing in.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't rush perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to find your strangest for
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we smoking right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: B9.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a cotton candy, lemon candy
paste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like musky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Daybreaker that gives it the
musky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daybreaker's got some real OG Kush
influence to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it's real important to give shout
outs to the people that let me breed with
[SPEAKER_01]: their strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gage completely encourages me to work with
his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole Gage Green Genetics crew is not
just one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you guys ever done a tasting party
or anything like this before?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the girls said no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the ladies said no.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you guys over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasting party?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever done something like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for being involved with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt, fist bump for putting me in this
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've revealed the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you what everything is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Miss Amanda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you got your phone over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a book coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cookbook?
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to just cut that part out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to give you a chance to shout
out your cookbook.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am finishing a cookbook that I've been
inspired by this trip to quickly finish by
[SPEAKER_03]: the 1st of January.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your cookbook called?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be called Eat Yourself Thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said it's mostly for women?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that everyone should know how to
cook clean and simple and on a budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether you cook for your boyfriend or
girlfriend or significant other,
[SPEAKER_03]: husband, wife, it's for those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have it finished by the end of
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how long to get it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we'll do a Skype interview when it
comes out, because you've cooked for the
[SPEAKER_01]: house and I ate some of the leftovers last
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I drove home like a satisfied man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that was some good food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to make sure to shout out your book.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: So catered to like vegetarian,
soy allergies, dairy allergies,
[SPEAKER_10]: gluten allergies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have about five different food
allergies in this house, and she's managed
[SPEAKER_10]: to cater to every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, I won't eat at somebody else's
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when she was talking to Hunt about his
gluten allergy and she said there's no egg
[SPEAKER_01]: in this and this, I was like, this lady
knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I totally trusted eating her food.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for feeding everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was super fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could tell you just live in the
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just comfortable in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Britt, what do you do when you're not
being a supermodel?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not a supermodel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant a supermodel, but you know what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am the general manager for Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: You manage?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I manage.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any help in the garden?
[SPEAKER_10]: I take care of the day-to-day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I recently started helping out in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a new appreciation.
[SPEAKER_10]: For the plant that I've been smoking for
the past 10 years because it is a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: work.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a little sweaty in there?
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit of sweaty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got my hair caught in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sticky fly traps and you know,
sore back and slice, slice fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the dudes with shaved heads are
laughing at you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like straight up like there's
something about Mary's status.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like my bangs just like up in the front.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty gross.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was gross.
[SPEAKER_10]: But so yeah, it was a really humbling
experience and a really good experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I really enjoy interacting with the
patients most and you know, getting to
[SPEAKER_10]: develop relationships with them and
building that trust.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's definitely where I think,
oh God, how long have I been in customer
[SPEAKER_10]: service now?
[SPEAKER_10]: How old am I?
[SPEAKER_10]: 13 years of customer service experience
probably serves me well in the front of
[SPEAKER_10]: the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do that and I'm married and I have a
dog and we like to stay home and smoke
[SPEAKER_10]: weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Puggle.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch Netflix.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, shout out to Penelope and Puggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow her on Instagram,
the sweetest dog on IG.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's such a diva.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I live the weed and Colorado
lifestyle and I've been here since April.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just enjoying the altitude and the
mountains and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome home.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This view here is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's snowing so perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys found the greatest spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we did a podcast right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Shayna, can I ask you what you do in
your normal everyday life when you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: being a model?
[SPEAKER_10]: Photographer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm a photographer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, she's babely enough to be a model.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why aren't you a model, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear why you aren't the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's silly.
[SPEAKER_10]: She retired.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she's the artist.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I bet it's much easier for you
ladies to pose and feel comfortable in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of a lady photographer instead of
some creepy dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_10]: We love shooting with Shayna and with her
past experience, she really, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: shoots each photo to the model's body and
she's really good at directing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, we love working with her.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were I'm so stoked about all of the
shots that we got from this weekend.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're real stoked to put out the
lookbook because Shayna killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the unedited shots and the lighting
is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made these ladies look great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, guys, for providing me with the
stuff I needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make it look so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Tristan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it sounds like we're going to do some
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm game.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you normally do in your normal
life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Normal life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bartender.
[SPEAKER_02]: At night and during the day, I hang out
with my dog a lot, smoke a bunch of weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: watch some Netflix and chill.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Miss Shy Girl, I'm going to ask
you next.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do in your normal day to day
life?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a bottle service girl on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: This bar called Barsmith in Monarch
Theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are going to stalk you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might cut that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I post on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to post about it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I ride my bike and I hike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your motorcycle, your Harley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about the Harley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 2010 1200 Nightster.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my first bike and I've had it for
just about a month now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks good on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks great on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for not being shy for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she passed the mic so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You nailed it, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Hunt, what do you do in your normal
life, brother?
[SPEAKER_08]: What doesn't he do besides getting his car
stolen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't really have a normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the people that stole your
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my car got stolen yesterday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about the irony of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we just mention this irony?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are more than welcome to bring up the
fact that I got paid to be a car thief
[SPEAKER_00]: model for the Department of Police and DMV
about identity theft and getting your car
[SPEAKER_00]: stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was on every Red Rock ticket and
every DMV department banner for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many Facebook and Instagram and
text messages did you get when your car
[SPEAKER_01]: got stolen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, so like five o'clock in the
morning, I started my car or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these guys got it while I was coming
out the front door and I chased them and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this other shit that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three or four hours later,
we got our car back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a double mic in him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm switching mics on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a mic on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So got the car back and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the day yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, two days ago, whenever it
happened on Thursday, I think I got about
[SPEAKER_00]: like 15 to 20 text messages of some sort
of image of myself as a car thief saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that your car was easy to steal and taking
your identity was even easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one that's like a really big
close up with me and it just says like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something about me taking your
ID or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm mad at myself for not making the
first meme situation that that's all
[SPEAKER_10]: credit to dad back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the Terpy boys coming
through the Terpy boys pointing over here
[SPEAKER_01]: to Amanda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you guys complimenting each other
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that all happened yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have much of a regular
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I mean, I have like my real
life is like, you know, grimy gats being
[SPEAKER_00]: four pieces and green, healthy wellness
and the growth that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I work at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you crush it in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you're doing when you hired
me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I don't know how to grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need you, bro.

[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about a real life yet.

my phone's on and we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there's a bed at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that tells you anything about life,
there's a bed at our shop where we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've slept in it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only worked there for less than a
month and I've crashed out in that bed.

before they get burned out.

the end of this show at the start and end.
