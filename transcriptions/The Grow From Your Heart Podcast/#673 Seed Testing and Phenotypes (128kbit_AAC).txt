[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen and you know I do
[SPEAKER_00]: include a link in the show notes and the
video description to make it nice and easy
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to send a special thank you
shout-out to all 200 of my Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hovering right around 200
patrons lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a bit overwhelming but big
salute, big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the part where I do invite you
to join us on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right the Discord server has
reached over 1,400 members.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode I said we hit 1,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are already to 1,400 members on the
Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great things happening
over on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: video chat where people are hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go root for your team in the Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I jumped in the Discord
server I let the crew help me design new
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working on a couple of designs for
some new merch that I'll talk about in a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode but I wanted some feedback
and some input so I went to the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a picture of the merchandise that
I had in mind and I said give me feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great feedback and I
compiled some of the crowd's input and
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback into a beautiful design so there
would be some great merchandise that was
[SPEAKER_00]: partially designed by the Discord crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're hanging out in the Discord
you may get the opportunity to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: design new merchandise, name new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be involved in a lot of great shit
if you join us on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course there is a link in the show
notes and the video description and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: type the link right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't click on it but you can at least
read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type that into your URL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again big thanks to everybody who's
hanging out on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that we designed some new
merchandise on the website iregenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link to the ire store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that link that will take you to
the ire store where the ire genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise is available for the podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have created the coupon code PODCAST10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That coupon code is good at the ire merch
store where you can get the shirts,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stickers, the coffee cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are grinders there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rolling trays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few other pieces of
merchandise that are coming but COVID has
[SPEAKER_00]: us slowed down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those items do arrive I'll send out
the MailChimp newsletter, let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add them to the store right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them available for the crew but don't
miss it on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the store link to use coupon code
PODCAST10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save you 10% off everything in
the web store.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right I do have some real topics here
that we want to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing, I don't talk about it a
lot because I try to keep some projects
[SPEAKER_00]: secret until I see a little bit of
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I talk about things a
little bit too early, it gives me the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to fail and then I've got to
talk about failures which is never fun but
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I should mention, even though I'm a
professional grower that has done a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, sometimes I still fail and it's okay
to fuck up and fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it humble you but let's get myself
back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am talking about an outdoor garden that
I've been playing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some outdoor breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to take all of the credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the team that worked
outdoors this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not want their names set here on
the show at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about them and introduce them
in the future if they want that but big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the help and for the work
and for the space but we've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor space going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a beautiful greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a few plants to the greenhouse and
I may have taken King Solomon out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and he may have done some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some outdoor breeding or some
greenhouse breeding and something I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned that those seeds developed
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor breeding happens really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not expecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds will be done earlier than
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollination happened much earlier than
anticipated and I learned a lot this year
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm very excited to have added outdoor
breeding to my list of skills that I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year was our inaugural run but I had
a good support team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had friends that I could message and
say, hey bro, I'm going to breed outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a paragraph of oddly spelled,
weirdly punctuated, shit and taught me how
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow outdoors and breed outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, I'm just picking on your brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can build a house, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jesse gave me some great advice and
with Jesse's advice, my lead and our
[SPEAKER_00]: crew's hard work and effort, we have got
some seeds that will be ready here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they'll be done by, they'll be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna give myself a deadline
but around the Halloween time we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up seeds, making packages,
getting that stuff ready for possibly the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that the Indo Expo is kind
of up in the air at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a week since I've recorded and I
have not, excuse me for that, it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: a week since I recorded and I have not
received any updates on the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, as soon as I do receive an
update on that, I will let you know but
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be a bunch of fresh seeds and
new crosses that you've never heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff I've never talked about will be
available that came out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I feel like I'm rambling because I'm
very excited about the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point was that things are happening
much more quickly in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds, it looked like I said,
oh this is where the buds are gonna,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was teaching somebody new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said these are where the buds are gonna
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it's gonna go and the next day
I was like, well there are all the buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I showed them this is where we
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the start of buds and the next day
it was like, holy shit, there are all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went really quickly outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already planning for the next year's
outdoor breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got ideas and things I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get in over my head sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's focus now on some of these
Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of Patreon questions
that came from the Patreon audience
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Patreon question in this episode
comes from our friend Zachary Yu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good outdoor growing question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's very applicable at this
time of year and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have eight plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of them are the same strains started
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are two pairs of different
strains started at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pair being scarlet begonias and
another pair, it doesn't say what the
[SPEAKER_00]: others are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, Five plants that consist of
three OGs, one scarlet begonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: one sweet cherry pie are in one area that
is pretty heavy with sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are behind the other three at another
spot in regards to flowering speed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the three of the same strain and the
same area are flowering at different
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can this be summed up to being simple as
different phenotypes or something I cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: even think of?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here is he's got several
plants and they're acting different
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some in one area and some in
another area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in the same area are showing
different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all came from the same package of
seeds, but they're showing different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my friend, that is a perfect example
of phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about it if somebody had,
let's talk about two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pick anybody's parents,
maybe yours, maybe not if you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about two parents, two breeding
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made three babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a family with three kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one tall, skinny kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one short chunk of your kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might not be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you may have one that is kind of
weirdly shaped in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One kid may be really athletic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One kid may not be athletic at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One may be really aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One may be really passive, but you came
from the same parents and you grew up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same exact environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just phenotypical expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants do very similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see that variation,
that expression in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very interesting on a totally
different experiment to take clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: put a clone of the same plant in your two
different grow locations and see what they
[SPEAKER_00]: do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I definitely think is happening is
that you are seeing phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a pack of seeds and you've
got four of the same plant in one area,
[SPEAKER_00]: they look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that it's just phenotypical
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read the question here and
make sure I answer that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another part that I do want to
touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that they are behind in flowering
compared to plants, the same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in another area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another part of phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that one area is getting more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's getting less light,
longer light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something is blocking the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's shaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the temperature is just a little bit
different over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the soil is a little bit different,
but that shows us how just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in environment can change the
plants drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're further behind each other or
further ahead each other in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because of the environment in which
they are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what you are seeing here is
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess all of it is phenotypical
expression, even if it is the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: making it happen because that's what
phenotypical expression is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing different traits based on
your environment, expressing different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you've got going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good foresight, good prediction,
good hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree with you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just basic phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Zachary Yu for
the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep him growing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you said you've got some iry
genetics outdoors, where are my photos,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictures, or it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are growing iry genetics,
I would love to see your photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me photos of my strains at any stage
of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg, flower, big buds, little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you think I might want to post to
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want me to share to social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is growfromyourheart
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just forward it right over to me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iry genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can spell genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-R-I-E underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shoot me your photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shoot me your photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want them shared, let me know you
want them shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want credit, let me know you want
credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want credit, let me know
because most of the time I just
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically will give you credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like, here's a picture of Scarlett
Begonia's grown by Zachary Yu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in my stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save it to the highlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be up there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we need some photos for the website,
so don't be afraid to send me photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me get myself back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back in a little bit of focus here
because I do have another great message in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend RastaBot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned RastaBot last week when we
were talking about Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: RastaBot, big thank you for all of the
dedication on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Discord gang always tells me,
bro, we don't need shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need love.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need high fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot believe the dedication and
commitment to the Discord server by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 1,400 people hanging out because
a few people decided they would build a
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows my mind, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The support that I get from the iRe Army
for this podcast, for the seed brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it still blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overwhelming in the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's motivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel like a superman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Superhero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a lot of great feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, there are a lot of people that I
cannot let down, which is a great yet
[SPEAKER_00]: scary feeling in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever stop doing what you're doing,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: From RastaBot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, hey, Rasta Jeff,
I've been loving the breeding talk you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have specific breeding questions,
please do send them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like specific questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me more focused on my rambles
because I do get rambly if you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, my mind was wandering
during your latest episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine probably was too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I thought of a couple related
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you breed, how often do you re-test
your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a person who breeds for commercial
purposes, my seeds are on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: through several different avenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good idea that I do keep up my
quality control standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you checking me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people go unchecked and they
forget to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for checking on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you make a thousand seeds and
that batch passes the test, do you re-test
[SPEAKER_00]: the next time you make a batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make a thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get to see, you guys get to see
most of the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it fairly transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of testers who are on social
media, but I also have testers who are not
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the folks who are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see Zo Zo Jay post every moment of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see from the sprout all the way
up in fucking time lapse video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else does a great job?
[SPEAKER_00]: All mixed up does a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin Man does a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mobius Gros does a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They post all that stuff to social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all the testers who I
didn't mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the list to just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an award show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to shout out everybody in
the gang, but all the testers post their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff up on social media and you guys get
to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to see that initial testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is the structure good?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the leaf shape like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the blood shape like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any cool colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we see if there are any
problems through those testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll show us where there are any
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, most of the time there are no
issues, but like all things, shit does
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a lot of testers going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send me test reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we decide if we want to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right before it's sold out or
sometimes unfortunately just after it
[SPEAKER_00]: sells out, I decide I need to make more
and restock that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where your question really comes
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I test this next batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do the Paul and Chuck and I'll make
the male plant and the female plant do
[SPEAKER_00]: their magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get the seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally will do a solid germination
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get, uh, I don't even know how many
seeds fit in the palm of my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably about 40 or 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just do the paper towel germination
test, fold up a paper towel a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do this piece of paper,
uh, fold it up, soak it with water,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw the seeds right in the middle there,
leave them on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they don't get any special treatment,
but I do make sure they're wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do check on them every few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I open it up to see how many of those
seeds germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my main concerns at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are germinating, they're healthy
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've went, they, uh, flower long
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finished most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell that by squeezing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I push them on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it hurts my finger and makes a dent,
the seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure they sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're sprouting, I'm mostly confident
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll send a few of those out as
freebies to the friends and they'll grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them and they'll know what they've got to
be like, Hey, run these real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll just run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could see what they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really do honestly rigorous,
vigorous, retesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as those mother plants and father
plant weren't ruined, destroyed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, compromised is the word I'm seeking in
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as there was no compromisation of
the parent plants, I feel like the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics are exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding will happen exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotypes are going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put any other, uh, there's no
other ingredients in my recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there should not be any variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if my parent plants will remain,
uh, remain uncompromised, if there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: compromised health, no stress,
uh, no light weirdness, no nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, anything like that, then it
should be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no scientific biological reason
why I would get variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe some epigenetics or something
like that may cost something, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it would take much longer than what I'm
able to do with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had them for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I don't do rigorous, vigorous
retesting of the crosses too deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do retest for germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I test every batch of seeds for germ
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know that every batch of seeds
is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I make a batch, there's a thousand
seeds in there, 50 to a hundred of them
[SPEAKER_00]: just go strictly just a germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll pull a few of those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've got room to keep them and grow
those, um, most of the time that's how it
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You germ like 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick fucking 25 of them, grow those,
uh, find 10 or 12 females in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: take pictures, all those have good
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how it usually goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second time around, I don't really
do vigorous testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send them out to the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, Hey, uh, Rosin man, Hey,
Mobius, Hey somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these are a remake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a quick run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I grow them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just grow a few and I can tell
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell quite quickly if they're
going to be worth a shit or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it wraps up with not looking to
have you do a quality control test on the
[SPEAKER_00]: air, just more wondering how different
breeding is between the same cuts over
[SPEAKER_00]: time and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, I have not noticed any
change in the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good at identifying the
offspring, the phenotypes from my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see any difference,
any, uh, any shift, any degradation,
[SPEAKER_00]: any weird evolution in my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it all looks just the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think I'd have to have the plants
for quite a bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd have to be doing it for quite
a bit longer for the plants to build up
[SPEAKER_00]: any memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, unless I started breeding with sick
plants or something, which, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point I don't do, if the plants
don't sustain health, if I can't keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, there's no need for them to stay
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can keep a plant basic health is
fucking I'm really good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look green and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look green and healthy all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if they're not staying green and
micro, they go bye-bye because they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I wrapped up your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give it a quick skim.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how often do you retest, uh,
strict germination testing, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: strict first level testing, second batch,
not serious on the retesting that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do do germ tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I wrap up this message,
I do have one cool topic I can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do some different testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mentioned it a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: A minute ago that I'm doing some breeding
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made some of the same crosses
outdoors that I've made indoors and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: not ever tested the outdoor grow yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the outdoor progeny
is going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a couple of friends, a couple of
testers that will run a batch of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: made indoors and a batch of seeds made
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the indoor seeds and outdoor seeds,
label them correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a plant a indoors plant B outdoors
and run them all next to each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there is any difference in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to run a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some friends to run a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the experiments are fun when I do
them, but I need more feedback as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see stuff, but, uh,
under the, whichever lights I choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: use in the summertime, I use one kind of
light in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use another, how do they respond under
my lights, but also how do they react in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow and in Dave's grow and in John's
grow and in Jack's grow and Jill's grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and Bill's grow and everybody's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty soon we're going to get to test
stuff that was made indoors right next to
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was made outdoors because I
recently bred some of the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of it's coming down from the
indoor grow and it's almost ready in the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ironically did the same stuff at the
same time and we'll get to test those side
[SPEAKER_00]: by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I'm very curious about
new testing that we'll get to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good side subject to get me
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about the outdoor
greenhouse, uh, grow this year and I super
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot wait to grow the seeds that come
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, are they more vigorous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they any different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any difference at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just know that we made a lot more
seeds outdoors than we would have indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the super cool part and it
seemed to happen super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am off on a good ramble again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's reel me back in and get back on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Rasta bot dude, thank you for a
great Patreon message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you once again for all of the
discord work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot wait to hang out with you on
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get done recording here,
it does take quite a few minutes to load
[SPEAKER_00]: all the files from the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onto the drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that happens, I go take a couple of
dabs and hang out with the crew on
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're there brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, we'll catch you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, and Paul and Chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this will be a quick Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do thank you once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what my brain said right
there, but you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for
listening to episode 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 73 of the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address for the podcast is grow
from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also send me your iry genetics grow
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see what you're growing,
see how you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can give you some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could share some of your picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want them shared here on the
podcast, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can start sharing your iry genetics
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a fun addition to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm glad you came up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really cool of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what else do I got for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the time of the podcast where I
ask you to like and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching, if you're listening on
an audio server, I do invite you to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the videos on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high quality 4k multi cam video
happening on YouTube right now that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may want to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube, click subscribe,
click on the notification bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, every time I put out a new
episode, you do get a notification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never miss any of the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, sometimes the audio servers
seem to be a little bit delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they miss some episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to repost them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making excuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not super tech savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working on fixing all of the
glitches on all of the audio feeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do my best to make sure that YouTube
is updated every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's actually Sunday night into Monday
at midnight and every Thursday or no,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of Thursday at midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure to have the YouTube video
posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been the priority because
honestly, I edit down the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pull the audio out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to do the video first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets up there on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while it's posting, I do the audio
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome a little bit behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like and subscribe on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the discord server and
everything else is on the Irene genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: website at Irene genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been rambling on for
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I'll be back in a couple of
days with fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my
buddy, Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama hug for me.
Thanks for watching.
