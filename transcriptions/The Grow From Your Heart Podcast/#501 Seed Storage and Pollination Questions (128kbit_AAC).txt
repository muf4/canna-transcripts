[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 501 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the show off by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Ice Cream
Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of I-95 and Screamin' OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
gas, mothball, and fabric softener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely get the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the mothballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about the fabric softener,
but I definitely get a punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing, tremendously delicious
concentrate, and it wrecks me and makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: slow, and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it does say
that this product does contain 64.04% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious I Scream Live
[SPEAKER_00]: Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers and growers, all you bad
motherfuckers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read some
emails from some listeners, but before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get there, let's do some shout outs to a
few of our friends who support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: High five, shout out, and a thank you to
our new friend, Michael W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast thank you to Paul A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant thank you to our

[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast thank you shout out to my friend
Glenn Gironi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who has continued to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I did say we were going to read
a couple of listener emails in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's do a quick
update of what's going on in my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I am replenishing the TMNT line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying that those should finish
at the end of January to be available at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning or middle of February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of now, it looks like those seeds
are right on schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the middle of February, we should
have more of the TMNT line available in
[SPEAKER_00]: its brand new packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got brand new custom packaging for each
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's a garden update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into some of the questions
and emails that came from my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with the question I get
asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an event is approaching,
I get this question more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people coming from out
of state for the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you hear this episode,
the Indo Expo will have just happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very large cannabis and
cultivation based trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come from all over the world,
all over the country for this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large portion of the people that come
for that event and events like it want to
[SPEAKER_00]: find and consume legal cannabis while they
are here visiting Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those people reach out to me
asking for dispensary recommendations and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations on places to go and things
to do while they are in Denver or while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those people also ask where
they can find iri genetics flowers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few dispensary recommendations
based on personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me or promotes the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any preferential treatment
to a dispensary because of any financial
[SPEAKER_00]: gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all because of my personal
experience and the quality of the product
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found at places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, most of the time I do
not know where they have got any of my
[SPEAKER_00]: strains on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is loaded with legal,
commercial, medical and recreational grows
[SPEAKER_00]: up and down the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those grows are wholesale grows,
which means they grow a large amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: product and then they wholesale several
pounds to this dispensary and several
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds to that dispensary and some to that
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows where that flower goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of the dispensaries have a
vertical integration system, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow most of their flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown in a grow facility which they
own and then it is passed right through
[SPEAKER_00]: their store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is really no way for me to know who
has got clones of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way for me to keep track of
that here in the Colorado system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't punch in something and say who's
got lemon Jeffrey in the system and see
[SPEAKER_00]: who's got the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably could if I tried to do some
digging in the system, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I would normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've even got access to
other facilities like that to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got a lemon Jeffrey plant or
something like that in their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no way for me to really know
who has got the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way for me to know who is
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's no way for me to know who has
flowered it and once it's flowered,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no way for me to know where it has
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my genetics could be everywhere and
they could be nowhere in a Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can recommend is that you
use some of the applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are apps you can download for your
phone and you're able to search menus
[SPEAKER_00]: through dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to that is many of the
dispensaries do not update their menus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there is a specific iry genetics
strain, which you are looking for while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're visiting Colorado, maybe open up
weed maps, type in the name of that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, see if it comes up, see if a
dispensary in your area has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they've got it, head over there and
hope that they have updated that menu
[SPEAKER_00]: recently and they've still got some on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people don't like weed
maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people also do not like leaf
leaf, but that may be another resource to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the strains you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one of those companies pay me,
but they are resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are available to consumers to find
the products they are searching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, I do not have a way to
know where my genetics are in the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other places with legalized cannabis,
they do have better systems where the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders actually get kickbacks for every
clone that is cut from one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, from one of their crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is another story for another
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from somebody who just
signed their message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not come across you talking about
seed long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's covered already, it would be great
to know the episode number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, can we get your input,
opinions, and recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace from A.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, I don't think I have done an episode on
seed storage and preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a quick talk on seed storage
and preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about storing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most important thing to think
about when you are storing seeds is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they stay dry, very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have harvested your own seeds,
leave them out in the open to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: can dry before you ever put them into any
type of a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds can get moldy just like buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they haven't dried, they do run the
risk of getting a little moldy film on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside that will cause germination
problems that can possibly slow down your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if they are kept too moist,
that will encourage your seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep those seeds as dry as you can
until you are ready to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are storing your seeds,
I recommend storing them with some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a silicate package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean a silicate pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use a Boveda pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to suck the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silicate pack will absorb the moisture
and keep that away from the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Boveda pack will actually reintroduce
moisture into your sealed container and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not what we want for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend whatever you store
your seeds in, that you put a silicate
[SPEAKER_00]: pack or a desiccant pack in with those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use dried rice if you don't
have a silicate or desiccant pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, make sure it is completely
dried like the boxed rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same idea as if you drop your
phone or some sort of electronics into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pool or into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say to drop your phone or your
electronics into a bag of dry rice and
[SPEAKER_00]: that rice will absorb the water and help
dry out your electronic device more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to get the moisture away
from our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, one of the most
important things to think about is
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that moisture away from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't seal them up when they are wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave the buds with the seeds
sitting around in something sealed because
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds will get moldy and the seeds
will have a little moldy film on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you drop those seeds in water,
you'll see a little white cloud come up
[SPEAKER_00]: off the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a little bit of mold that is grown
on the seed from being sealed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: container with too much moisture and just
enough heat to make a moldy environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have many options of containers for
storing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you choose to use, I suggest you
make some sort of effort to keep light
[SPEAKER_00]: away from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get bright light on the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them dry and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when you are deciding
which kind of container in which to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using seeds that you bought from
a breeder or a vendor, they should be
[SPEAKER_00]: packaged in something that keeps the light
out already.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seeds are already sold in a package
that does not allow light to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also very clearly labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more than one strain or
variety of seeds in your collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you label it very carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put the strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put the cross and say,
sometimes I will even put the date on
[SPEAKER_00]: which I started storing those seeds on the
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just put a bunch of seeds in some
baggies and label those baggies and roll
[SPEAKER_00]: those baggies up and then throw all of
those baggies into one container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can store that wherever you feel
is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got several options for seed
storage in this type of setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that it is dry and dark and
also cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of my favorite places to store seeds
are in the crisper drawer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator and also in a safe in a
basement corner in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, it never gets too warm in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always going to be nice and chilled
down in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that earth insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a safe down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put all the seeds in a safe and those
seeds will stay nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to put the seeds in the
crisper drawer in the refrigerator,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do highly recommend you put the silicate
pack in with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then seal that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put all of your seeds in another
container and seal that master container
[SPEAKER_00]: so that no moisture ever makes contact
with your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're the kind of guy that likes
to take the seeds out and show them off
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often, I may not refrigerate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the idea of the seeds being
nice and refrigerated and you bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: out occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You show them to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taken them from that cold
environment to the normal atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do run the risk of getting some kind
of condensation happening when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: moving from environment to environment
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to store them in the
fridge, leave them there until you are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not personally recommend freezing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how I store them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some of the largest and most
relied upon seed storage facilities on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet do store seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to store seeds for very long
term storage, that is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, it is done on a large
scale and it must work if that place is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had great success with storing
seeds in a safe or in a crisper drawer in
[SPEAKER_00]: a refrigerator for two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds are still highly viable
and have a very high germination rate and
[SPEAKER_00]: are very active and successful seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not find a reason to freeze my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will freeze their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got some seeds that you can
experiment with, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to freeze your seeds,
I really want to repeat the part I said
[SPEAKER_00]: about not removing the seeds to show your
friends or to look at them or just examine
[SPEAKER_00]: them or marvel at your collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put those seeds in the freezer,
leave them there until you are ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are multiplying your risk of getting
condensation in those seeds when you take
[SPEAKER_00]: them from that frozen environment to the
non-frozen environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to thaw out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of packaging
they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting frost inside of the
package?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not recommend freezing them in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, do not take them out and
put them back and take them out and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them back just to enjoy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend something like a
nice cool drawer in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a filing cabinet in a
corner in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably a good idea, a good
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a crisper drawer in the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cold enough to keep your seeds
fresh and safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I feel like I'm rambling because I'm
stoned from those dabs, but let's recap a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main things we need to think about are
keep the seeds dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let moisture get to your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get wet, they are going to
germinate or they are going to become
[SPEAKER_00]: non-viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them in a cool, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need it frozen and we don't want
it hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it kind of cool and we want to
keep them away from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light and the water are what make them
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not provide the triggers that
will make these seeds germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep them dark and let's try to keep
them nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still think it's winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting for the spring to come
around so they can germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just keep them right there on
hibernation mode until we're ready to use
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank my friend A for the great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Super Kev over at
Garden City Genetics and the message goes
[SPEAKER_00]: just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your show for quite
some time and I keep learning new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're loving it and I'm glad
you're learning from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say your show is definitely
the tits as someone else recently
[SPEAKER_00]: described it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is awkward, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says feel free to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Super Kev and I'm
located near Toronto, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Super Kev?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been growing for 20 years
with many different growth styles,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, lighting, genetics, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medicinal patient now, but I've been
doing it since the good old bad days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten my feet wet with some breeding
over the years and I've had some decent
[SPEAKER_00]: success and I've created a few winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I have focused my efforts on
breeding and I've started to work on my
[SPEAKER_00]: brand, which is Garden City Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got a lot of
experience and most people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and playing that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do end up as breeders because that is
just part of the passion that leads us to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next part of the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm trying to learn as much as I
can about proper techniques and tricks you
[SPEAKER_00]: may want to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the last two breeding
podcasts where he described the packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: terms in good detail and I'm hungry for
more info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling, but I'll try to squeeze out
a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I never apologize for rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast for stoned rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great message so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says with limited space and plant count
numbers, is it best to flower many males
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time and collect their pollen
for future use with the paintbrush or does
[SPEAKER_00]: this technique affect germination rates at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, do you like to dilute your pollen
with toasted flour or something like this
[SPEAKER_00]: or as direct pollination always best?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first part of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me touch on that for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have more than one male plant in
flower at a time because I only want to
[SPEAKER_00]: gather pollen from one male plant so that
I know my cross is from that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would never have two different males
going in my garden at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: because pollen just flies around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen from plant A and pollen from plant
B are going to go every direction and end
[SPEAKER_00]: up on your female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have no idea which pollen donor
made those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would never have multiple males going
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do one male, collect the pollen,
chop him down, then clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to spray and clean up all that
pollen that may be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do another male and gather that
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like to work with multiple
males at one time because I do fear pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do gather pollen from one
plant and you find one solid female that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to put that pollen onto,
the paintbrush technique is very useful
[SPEAKER_00]: and it does not cause any problems with
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting pollen onto plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're receiving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make seeds just like any other
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do not recommend pollinating that
plant with more than one type of pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: from different pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're doing it carefully,
you're still going to get cross
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that you only
experiment with one male at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be saying, no way, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do four or five males at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't suggest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you plan on releasing those seeds
to anybody, that is almost an
[SPEAKER_00]: irresponsible move as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of fast tracking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not doing it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't do that to your consumers,
to your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want something reliable from one
solid male.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you cross the pollen up and you're
not sure which pollen made those seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody gets the most amazing offspring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know which male made that so you
can reproduce that phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't because there were
multiple males and you had leaked pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who is that baby daddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this part of the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you like to dilute your pollen
with toasted flour or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I am pollinating with a
male plant or with a reversed plant and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have saved pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the actual pollen donor plant in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it flower out until it is dumping
pollen and then I move it over by the
[SPEAKER_00]: girls and I just give it a couple of good
flicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all it really takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just flick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flick the stem and that vibrates it
enough to make enough pollen go flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fans and all the movement in
the room just pollinate naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do have a reversed plant after that
flick, I will cut off a couple of the tops
[SPEAKER_00]: and I smack them on the walls and I smack
them against the fan just to knock that
[SPEAKER_00]: last bit of pollen out of there because
the reversed plants do not make near as
[SPEAKER_00]: much pollen as a standard male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, I do not save pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a little bit of emergency pollen
saved, but that is not how I generally
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pollen that I do have saved,
no, I do not cut it with any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cornstarch or what did you say,
toasted something, toasted flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dry the pollen completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remove all of the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure it is crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in a vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a jar of vials in a paper bag in
the bottom drawer of the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my emergency pollen is
stashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you also mentioned increasing the
light cycle after pollination for fatter
[SPEAKER_00]: plumper seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cycle do you run for pollinated
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could they finish well in a bedroom with
less intense light or will that affect
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do run a non-conventional light schedule
once my plants are pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to get as much light energy to
those plants as they can receive because
[SPEAKER_00]: my goal is no longer to create big,
fat, chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new goal has become to make big,
fat, healthy, chunky seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to change my timer to a longer
daytime cycle that does disrupt the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few weeks, you will see the plants
start to revert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll try to go back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start acting weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not growing for buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes super healthy, super happy
seed because they are getting more light
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes them finish a little bit
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to harvest for those seeds a
little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your main question on this was,
can you move those seeded plants back into
[SPEAKER_00]: a bedroom with less light and flower those
plants in the bedroom probably so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can utilize the flower room for some
seedless plants is what I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, you are able to move those plants
into the bedroom if you have got enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those plants are going to receive
enough light from being under an extended
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle as compared to being under a
short cycle under larger lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't move them if they are going to
get less you moles per day in their new
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because they are getting longer
light cycles doesn't mean they are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more light if the light in the other room
was twice as strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would only suggest changing the light to
a longer day cycle if you are able to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them more overall lumens than the previous
light condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is more to this email,
so I need to keep moving quickly because
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode is getting long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part says, also, do you find many
F1 or polyhybrids show more intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by working them down filial
generations, is that a trait that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's any intersex traits in an F1
batch, do you scrap it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're asking if in an F1 or a
polyhybrid batch, do I find more intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: More intersex traits than an F2 or an F3
or an IBL?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I find intersex traits are
if the plants were bred from plants which
[SPEAKER_00]: carried intersex traits themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find that polyhybrids or F1s are
more prone to hermaphroditism or intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not something I find to be common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think any generation could be a
hermaphrodite if the parents were
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to touch on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, by working them down filial
generations, is that a trait that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex traits, hermaphroditism,
can be bred out over generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why would you even want to waste your
time doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 10 plants and two of them
are hermaphrodites, why breed with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite when you've got eight other
opportunities?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already crippling yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're slowing yourself down in the race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wasting time unless there's
something really amazing in that
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic plant that you want to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abandon that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it and work on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go right back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you going to hobble yourself at
the beginning of the race when you can set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for a success?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a cook-off and you were
trying to please some of the best chefs on
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet, you wouldn't go to some fast
food restaurant and get some shit and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a bag and set it in front of them
and go, Bon Appetit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would go to the finest store in your
neighborhood and get the finest
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients and you would make the best
shit you can give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they eat it, you would have
confidence because you knew that you used
[SPEAKER_00]: solid ingredients and solid methods and
solid techniques and you've created a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that is satisfactory that
everybody will enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to four fast food restaurants
and get a burger from one place,
[SPEAKER_00]: a taco from another and a milkshake from
another and put it on a plate and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: look nice, nobody's going to be impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to happen if you breed
with hermaphrodite seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to serve somebody a big plate
full of bullshit and they're all going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, I think I'm hungry or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one more part to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, or would you just scrap that if
there are any intersex traits in the F1
[SPEAKER_00]: batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a new polyhybrid or an F1 showed
intersex traits, it goes bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scrap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need to continue that project,
but I avoid that by testing my parent
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before I breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is no way to test a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to test them is to pollinate
and then run those seeds, but I test my
[SPEAKER_00]: females very rigorously, very vigorously,
very aggressively before I do breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I test a female before you breed
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that that female is
not a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that that female
doesn't get powdery mildew and bud rot
[SPEAKER_00]: very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice if your females that you use
aren't prone to getting pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some strains that if you put
them in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants right next to them will get
spider mites and some plants the bugs just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't crawl on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I test my females?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get the females I intend to breed
with and I'll put them in a small grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put them in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about two weeks into the flowering
process, I'll mess up the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it on 18.6 again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're going, hey, we were in
flower for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're back in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of days later,
I'll turn it off for two full days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they don't know what the fuck is going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after two days, let's put it back on
12.12 and watch those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will hermaphrodite and show
stress problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants get pulled from my garden and
do not get bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that go through that process
and come out looking happy and healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants I am confident in putting
tested pollen on and I know that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make winter plants out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what your specific goal is in a
breeding project, the main goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve upon the two lines you are working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross two things together and it
comes out worse, why keep going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I see any intersex traits in an F1
or an F2, I will scrap the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, there is no need for me to
keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I've ranted enough
on that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently ran a direct pollination with
one male and a few select females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I introduced the male a week after the
females, as I've heard suggested before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I removed the male after day 28 for the
females and the seeds never seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: ripen even with three extra weeks of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some seeds from it, but the buds are
garbage also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, sometimes breeding can be
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where you went wrong with
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you timed it
semi-correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a few tries with breeding to time
things up because you don't know when that
[SPEAKER_00]: female is going to want pollen best and
you don't know when that male is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a matchmaking move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to time them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once pollination happens,
you do have to feed the plants a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit differently for quality seed
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they just didn't get the feed
that they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they didn't get enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know why those seeds didn't
work, but sometimes that's how breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got a lot of reading
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely recommend reading The
Breeders Bible from Greg Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that book would really give you a
head start and help you figure out some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the minor details you might be missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's one more quick paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in closing, any more detailed
information on your process and what works
[SPEAKER_00]: and doesn't work for you would be
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make fatter, darker seeds with
better germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, bro, I think read a
couple of quality breeding books and those
[SPEAKER_00]: will get you over some of the very minor
details that you are missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of stuff to learn when it
comes to breeding and I can teach you a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, but I think reading a book will give
you the foundation that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap up the message with,
thank you for taking the time to read
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear from you.
