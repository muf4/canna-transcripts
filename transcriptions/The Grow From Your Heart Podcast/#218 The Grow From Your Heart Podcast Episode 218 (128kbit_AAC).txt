[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode 52 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower or a professional
grower, if you're a new smoker or a
[SPEAKER_01]: veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
activist, or if you're just curious about
[SPEAKER_01]: the current state of cannabis,
this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send a huge thanks to the Mystic
Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot for letting me play your
music on the show, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: The song is DJ Anna Dance, the
instrumental version.
[SPEAKER_01]: The intro I usually play is called the
Doggy Dub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to switch it up, you know,
bring some spice to your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Kat and Coot from the
Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming to you on, today was our good
friend, Jesse's birthday, and it was also
[SPEAKER_01]: cousin Tater's birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just got home from Jesse and Tater's
birthday party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that was a fun party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not an alcohol drinker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I left when the alcohol kind of got a
little heavy, but we retreated back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Weeden and Spence and Matty and
Michael and Big Mike and myself and Joe
[SPEAKER_01]: hung out and took some dabs after the rest
of the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, big shout out to Jesse and Tater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep calling you Tater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, your name's Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, cousin Tater and Uncle Jesse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for bringing me to your party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, huge, huge shout out to Matty and
Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a little dinner at their house
before the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to a bowling alley and tried to
bowl, but it was too damn crowded,
[SPEAKER_01]: so everyone just ended up in the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, we went to Spence and
Matty's and had some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a vegetarian and I will not eat
anything with animals or animal products
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can eat what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't judge you, but I don't eat
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were nice enough to make me several.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an entree for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a portobello, a big portobello
mushroom, and I put it on a bun and I
[SPEAKER_01]: called it a portobello mushroom burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a couple of slices of avocado,
some Swiss cheese, put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: onion on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made some potatoes that were
delicious and some pasta salad that was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big, huge shout out to those guys for
catering to my picky ass and taking care
[SPEAKER_01]: of me and my picky diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Spence and Matty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me at the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you guys every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yesterday was Bob Marley's birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're doing birthday shout outs,
I got dreadlocks and I'm a rasta,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know I love me some Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of other reggae,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone always tells me when they see my
dreadlocks, the first thing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people say is, I love Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, there's more reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to some other reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out some Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out some Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're into it, it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out some Bounty Killer and some
Capelton and see where I was inspired to
[SPEAKER_01]: name my strains from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honored two of my favorite reggae
artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kalanji is after Sizzla Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out Sizzla, Bounty Killer,
and Capelton also and see where I decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to name some of my strains that I've bred
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing an episode by myself,
guys, so I'm just going to be rambling for
[SPEAKER_01]: a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some news articles and this will
be the episode where I am going to
[SPEAKER_01]: announce the winners from episode number
50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm probably going to do that towards
the end of the show, just to keep you
[SPEAKER_01]: listening, because that's how you build
suspense and keep people listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you entered the contest on Facebook
and or Instagram, this could be the show
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're going to get excited and win
some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep listening and I'll tell you the
winners in a minute here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get that far, I have to do this
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to you by some of
my good friends, some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: people, Jesse and Bern, over at Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies.

[SPEAKER_01]: Also, new to Hygro Indoor Growing
Supplies, they are now carrying Rocky
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Worm Company worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, if you've messed with worm castings
before, the minute you pick up this bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: worm castings, you will know that this is
a high quality bag of castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody paid me to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a bag of it myself and it smells
rich like worm casting should.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the proper color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a little bit of tea out of it and
that tea foamed up really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are going to think I'm
gross because I think the worm tea smells
[SPEAKER_01]: good, but it smelled the way I was
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality, quality worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for the mic bump right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out Hygro Indoor Growing
Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, big shout out to Jay and the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are scheduled, Jay and one of his
partners whose first name I do not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know his Instagram name, but I don't
know his real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay from Rocky Mountain Worm Company and
one of his partners are scheduled to be
[SPEAKER_01]: here on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're supposed to be here Tuesday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we said six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might've been five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check my scheduling, but they will be
here to record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next episode should be Jay from Rocky
Mountain Worm Company and we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about worms and environmentally
sustainable cannabis and organics and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll see what Jay brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kind of let them talk and
tell us what they want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coming up after that, I think we'll be
an episode with Jesse talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to give a lesson on light
deprivation so that you guys can get your
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor crops going a little bit earlier
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start, we're starting to
plan more outdoor lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just letting you guys know,
we got a lot of cool shit coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not slacking off like I used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get more on top of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do it week by week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm trying to be a week or two ahead
of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I'm bringing you a better
show, which I want to keep doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to somebody told me that they went
back and listened to a bunch of old
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes and I felt embarrassed,
but then they told me, don't be
[SPEAKER_01]: embarrassed because I'm kicking ass now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got to see the progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that said that, you know who you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more ad, this podcast is brought to
you through the month of February.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's leap year or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it either expires on the 28th or the
29th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way it expires on the 29th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it before that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks, much shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks and much shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect to Nature's Green Remedies
for the promotion and the continued
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been with us since the beginning
of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are our longest running sponsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big love to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are interested in sponsoring
the podcast, all you have to do is send me
[SPEAKER_01]: an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com and
I'll get you all of the information that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to run your ad on one episode,
I will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to continue to add through a
lot of episodes, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a product that you want to
send me, let me play with it and give you
[SPEAKER_01]: a review on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will definitely do that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like bringing information to my
listeners and that's a good way to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: as product reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take a minute and read a couple
of the Facebook and Stitcher comments that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to save them on my phone,
so I'm searching through the phone right
[SPEAKER_01]: now to find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, my iPhone has been slow lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a comment that was left on our
iTunes, the Grow From Your Heart iTunes
[SPEAKER_01]: page.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comment was from a person who calls
himself Sticky Wiki.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave us five stars and he says,
good, listen, recently found the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have followed iRegenetics on IG,
which is Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I followed iRegenetics on Instagram for a
while now and I'm really enjoying some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these episodes and take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sticky Wiki gave us five stars and loves
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for also, thanks for following
iRegenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to have you on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go comment on something and I will follow
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me who you are and I'll follow you
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next comment was from a guy named
Buzzer with a bunch of Z's.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, sweet show, five stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his comment was, thanks for making
this for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for commenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for showing me that you appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're a growing better candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you have a better understanding of
the cannabis plant, the community,
[SPEAKER_01]: and my goal of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you learned some stuff and thanks a
lot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Robert Lee commented,
Robert Lee, I know who you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for finally listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to get you to listen to
the podcast for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem to be reluctant to hear me on the
show, but thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: His comment was left on Stitcher and he
said, I really enjoyed this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he left that comment on episode 51,
our CBD episode, which featured Angela and
[SPEAKER_01]: my good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buddy Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys listen to that, you understand
why I'm going to give a huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela for letting me post that entire
show without editing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of what she said there was kind of
personal and could have been embarrassing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she's a badass chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a badass woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: She deserves more respect than being
called a chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a badass woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she let me post the entire
conversation without a single edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the Stitcher and iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little bit of a brain fart there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you guys leaving
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows me that you are listening to the
show and if you hate the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can leave a comment because I haven't
gotten a shitty comment yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do people just not do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just not, you probably skipped it
and don't even want to listen if you hated
[SPEAKER_01]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even go leave a shitty review,
but it makes me feel good that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: liking it and giving me lots of good
stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please leave me a review you guys,
because what that does is it boosts me up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the iTunes and in the Stitcher
rankings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more people see the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the more people see the show,
the more listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the more people grow better
cannabis and the more people have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: education about cannabis, then we can
dispel a lot of the stupid myths and
[SPEAKER_01]: rumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can legalize cannabis
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our, I think that's our goal for
now is to legalize it and grow the best we
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are our two main objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to assign ourselves main
goals, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow the best cannabis we can and legalize
this shit everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really rambly today, which is good
because I'm by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time to get into some news
articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first article has nothing to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it loosely has something to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that is personal to me,
and I found it very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: The remaining members of the Grateful
Dead, along with Trey from Phish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of you guys are going blah,
blah, blah right now, but just give me 10
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a concert in Chicago on the third,
fourth, and fifth of July at Soldier Field
[SPEAKER_01]: in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is celebrating 50 years of the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mickey Hart, Bill Krutzman,
Phil Lesh, Bob Ware, Trey Anastasio,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Chimitti, and Bruce Hornsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing three shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Grateful Dead music.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article comes from JamBase.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, if you're like us, you were
wondering just how many mail orders were
[SPEAKER_01]: received for Fair the Well, which will
bring together Grateful Dead members,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Ware, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart,
and Bill Krutzman, along with Trey
[SPEAKER_01]: Anastasio, Jeff Chimitti, and Bruce
Hornsby for three nights of shows in
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicago over the fourth of July weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is almost unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the part I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a note on the event's website mentions
that 60,000 plus envelopes were received
[SPEAKER_01]: so far, which is by the company that's
handling their mail order fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tickets only went on sale through
mail order, which is only the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's up are going to be able to
order the mail order.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't like a publicly known thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to kind of be on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got 60,000 requests just from the
mail order.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a huge event,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Chicago on the third,
fourth, or fifth of July, make sure you go
[SPEAKER_01]: check out Soldier Field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't want to go to the
concert, go see what it's like to be on a
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful Dead lot, the parking lot scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go see that hippie scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go see that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to see the Grateful Dead
because I was only 15 when Jerry died,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, 15 or 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did see plenty of fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, fish kind of took over for
the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dead, fish, all of that stuff kind
of means something to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys go see that lot,
go see that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know Rasta Jeff could be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not committed to anything yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go see that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check that shit out, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of why I am who I am and a
lot of what made me who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, the stream Chem Dog was
discovered in a bag of weed that was
[SPEAKER_01]: bought on a Grateful Dead parking lot at a
Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where Chem Dog came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there weren't these silly hippies
traveling around being deadheads,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem Dog would not exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the streams that we work with
now would not exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my lineup would not exist because
a lot of my stuff is crossed with Chem
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, news article here, number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, new regulations on pot edibles
designed to protect children and adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was put out January 30th.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually from CBS Denver Channel
4.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, new regulations on pot edibles go
into effect Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those regulations are designed to protect
children and warn adults about the potency
[SPEAKER_01]: of marijuana edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law is being put into place by the
Colorado Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The agency is hoping to prevent problems
that have put Colorado's budding retail
[SPEAKER_01]: pot industry under scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a picture of this African
student.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to blame a lot of this on
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, an African student in Wyoming,
I'm just going to say Levi-Tamba,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm not sure how to pronounce
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Levi-Tamba died after eating an entire
marijuana-infused cookie and jumping off a
[SPEAKER_01]: hotel balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have also been several cases of
children mistaking pot for candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means some changes for edibles,
including placing marijuana-infused candy
[SPEAKER_01]: and baked goods in child-proof packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each individual square of chocolate must
be marked according to how potent it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, back in the day when you
would buy... I can't even pick a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't want to single out a
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day when you would buy a large
edible of a candy bar, it would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of your normal candy bar that you buy
at the gas station or at the grocery
[SPEAKER_01]: store, wherever you get your candy bar,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You would buy that one candy bar and it
would just look... It would be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapper that was plainly marked,
this is a ganja candy bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once you open it, you can't tell
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now every single piece, they have made
a mold that you pour your chocolate into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not you, but the companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pour their chocolate into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it divides it for you into little
squares and they're showing a picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole candy bar is 100 milligrams,
but now they've divided it into 10 little
[SPEAKER_01]: squares and they're all labeled 10
milligrams THC for each little square.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's a little better because
sometimes when you buy edibles,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't remember what you bought or you
don't remember which is which,
[SPEAKER_01]: or sometimes it's hard to tell if this is
a third or if this is a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now these guys have really made it nice
and easy for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep reading the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, at the Incredibles Edibles shop,
they mark each square of chocolate with
[SPEAKER_01]: the number 10 to indicate 10 milligrams of
THC, the psychoactive ingredient of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 is the standard serving.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, chocolate didn't have to
indicate the amount of THC in each bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were in line with what
industry feels will improve... I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to start that sentence again, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are in line with what the
industry feels will improve safety out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others seem like overkill, but we were
happy to do it, said Incredible spokesman,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Eschino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some clerks working at retail pot shops
have been recommending much more,
[SPEAKER_01]: which could cause some issues with those
who had not had much experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, edible packaging contains warnings to
eat only a small amount and then wait
[SPEAKER_01]: before eating more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says, wait 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you eat this, wait 45... This is a
weirdly worded article.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says, wait 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you eat this, wait 45 minutes to
see how it affects you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can continue with another
dose if you really wanted to, says Sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf spokeswoman, Elizabeth D.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long last name, Elizabeth D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't butcher that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're showing a picture of the
package and it totally shows like a
[SPEAKER_01]: little, it says to educate and to
medicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like a little clock on there,
like the one that you'd see at the store
[SPEAKER_01]: that says, be back in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead it shows, it says, take one
square, wait two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying to encourage you to take
one and wait two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is a lot of people don't,
dude, they think they're bad asses and
[SPEAKER_01]: they can just eat it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back into the article, a variety of
the marijuana infused products,
[SPEAKER_01]: including drinks, cookies, and candies
come in single servings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to educate people that five
milligrams is a good serving, not too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, not over the top, make it safe,
said Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't read her last name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's long.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first step in regulation for
the edibles industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good idea, you guys,
but something I wanted to bring up,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to crush a couple of
companies, I'm sure, because this came up
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly and it had to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it went into effect on the first
of this month and they didn't get a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People had to pull product that they have
already made, already have packaged,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had to pull it all off the shelf and
then they had to repackage it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I don't know if they were even allowed
to repackage it because if the pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't properly labeled, they had to
destroy those candy bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm certain that this put at least one
or two small businesses out of business
[SPEAKER_01]: because of these new regulations they keep
pushing on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of agree with the whole situation
because, well, I work at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: and I hang out with people that work there
all day and we insist to people,
[SPEAKER_01]: just take this and they laugh like they're
going to be able, like they're Superman
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't realize what they're buying
is proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're used to buying brownies that
their cousin made or that their stoner
[SPEAKER_01]: uncle made and they weren't that potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're buying these medical edibles
and they're just getting, or they're rec
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles, but I mean, they're made by the
same people that make medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying these quality edibles and
they're just getting fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like the idea that we're
marking them each piece, but it's hard
[SPEAKER_01]: for, I'm sure it's hard for a business to
keep itself going when every month there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a new regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, you guys put all those
stripes on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have to put the stripes plus a
hologram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to crush somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into another news
article because that one is boring as
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up to The Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: They read a lot of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is by David Magoya.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a writer for the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline says, Oregon's M Bank pulls
out of Colorado a week after taking on pot
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you are going to say what,
but I'll catch you up to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the Oregon community bank that a
week ago openly welcomed the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana industry customers has changed
its mind, publicly saying it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the infrastructure to handle the
overwhelming response for service.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people familiar with the move say the
retreat was pressed by federal banking
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators who stepped in late last week
to tell M Bank executives that crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: several states to work with an industry
that remains illegal under federal law was
[SPEAKER_01]: simply too risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Following national press, the volume of
inquiries in Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Colorado has been so overwhelming that
we don't currently have the infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: to adequately support all of these
customers, M Bank CEO Jeff Baker said
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is the furthest from our market
area and the most difficult to provide the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality customer service to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are nearly 2,200 pot retail
manufacturing and grow businesses in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, according to the state licensing
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bank will continue to serve legal
marijuana businesses in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, Baker said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry Insider said the pullback was not
unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've become accustomed to our banking
solutions not actually working out,
[SPEAKER_01]: said Michael Elliott, executive director
of the marijuana industry group.
[SPEAKER_01]: After they got all that press,
I was wondering if they'd get increased
[SPEAKER_01]: scrutiny and pressure as a result,
just like all the other banks have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the issue, Baker said,
was M Bank's lack of a Colorado branch,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would require approval from the
state banking authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not need approval to accept
deposits from Colorado businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just searching for loopholes to
not want to do business with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it says without branch cash
deposits, millions of dollars that often
[SPEAKER_01]: must be treated with clean cleaners such
as Febreze to remove the pungent marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: smell would have to be made at a federal
reserve bank, such as one located in
[SPEAKER_01]: downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, deposits would be
electronically credited to M Bank's
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts, then to its marijuana business
depositors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founded in 1995, the $165 million bank has
three Oregon locations in and around
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It nearly closed in 2009 following a
string of problems that ranged from
[SPEAKER_01]: inadequate board management to a balance
sheet weight
[SPEAKER_01]: down by toxic and poorly performing loans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hard to say, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab here after this
article, trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Baker said the five
Colorado-based marijuana business accounts
[SPEAKER_01]: that were open will most likely be closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not 100% on that, but we're reviewing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another 60 inquiries from Colorado pot
shop owners will be shelved, he said,
[SPEAKER_01]: when M Bank went public with its desire to
bank the marijuana sector last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brazenness raised industry eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banking regulators, such as the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which oversees M Bank, have frowned on
institutions that are overt about working
[SPEAKER_01]: with legal cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's legal pot businesses have long
lamented that their accounts are closed as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as, okay, as soon as where they are
banking becomes public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exactly the reason why the
marijuana industry cannot say who they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a bank account with and why the banks
don't want it public, Elliott.
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baker sidestepped the question about
whether the FDIC, the agency he said
[SPEAKER_01]: offered its tactic approval to the idea
only a week ago that pushed M Bank out of
[SPEAKER_01]: control out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are regulated by the government and the
expectation is that we run our bank in a
[SPEAKER_01]: safe and sound manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the event we don't, we face severe
repercussions from our regulators,
[SPEAKER_01]: Baker said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly regulators influence our
decisions, but it ultimately is our call.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were definitely coerced into it by
the FDIC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want, the feds don't want
cannabis money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want us to be able to bank,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others familiar with the outcome of the
FDIC frowned at the public nature of M
[SPEAKER_01]: Bank's move, making it unclear whether the
plan would have met approval had it not
[SPEAKER_01]: been so well publicized.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regulators have the gun and all the
bullets, said one banking insider who's
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with the FDIC and its methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of us who have survived the financial
crisis knows exactly how this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're not team players, our life
becomes miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado has had several efforts at
banking, at banking, the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: industry go awry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most recent, a long delay in the
opening of the fourth corner credit union.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world's first credit union created
specifically for the pot industry had
[SPEAKER_01]: expected to open at the new year,
but it has not yet been granted a master
[SPEAKER_01]: account by the federal reserve bank in
Kansas city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're already two months,
almost three months behind in getting that
[SPEAKER_01]: open because the feds don't want us to put
our money in the banks so that we can have
[SPEAKER_01]: it on us when they rate us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they can take it all from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'll keep reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: A move last year by the Colorado
legislature set the stage for a banking
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative similar to a credit union,
but has made no progress despite numerous
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because it too would require the
same master account necessary to access
[SPEAKER_01]: the nation's money system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs State Bank, the last
Colorado bank to openly work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana industry closed about 300
accounts in late 2011 that made concerns
[SPEAKER_01]: of working with companies that violate
federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baker said he'll likely revisit the
Colorado plan, but it might take some
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The position of state and federal
regulators is that they do not object to
[SPEAKER_01]: banking services being provided to the
cannabis industry, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they absolutely expect the
development of strong programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time and experience will allow programs to
become stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't sound like they want to work
with us at all to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: These dispensaries are making a lot of
money and without having a bank,
[SPEAKER_01]: I see how difficult it can be because
other businesses don't want to be paid in
[SPEAKER_01]: cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever businesses are attached to your
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a security guard all day
long, so you have to pay for security
[SPEAKER_01]: service.
[SPEAKER_01]: The security service does not want to be
paid in cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the dispensary customers paid in
cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the dispensary is sitting on a shit
ton of cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to turn that into some sort of
currency that they can pay the
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity, they got to pay payroll,
they've got to pay the accountant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got to pay the lawyer, they've got to
pay the employees, they got to pay the
[SPEAKER_01]: master grower, they got to buy nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pain in the ass to deal with
this because I'm going to press pause for
[SPEAKER_01]: a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink and a dab and
I'll be right back with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for letting me get a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was getting all dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple more news articles and then
we're going to get to the part that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's waiting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give away some prizes,
some prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bear with me through a couple more
articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm building up suspense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another article in a minute
that's going to come from my hometown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to click over and see how long
we've been going at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple more articles and I'll give away
the prizes and I'll get out of here and
[SPEAKER_01]: let you guys get back onto your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is from Ricardo Baca from The
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it says $573 million in pot
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are 12 stats that define the year in
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple episodes ago, Spence and Matty
came on and we talked about the year in
[SPEAKER_01]: review.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in episode 50, we talked about
live resin kind of being one of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: dicks of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cannabis went and put together their
12 stats of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read most of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably won't read all 12 of them
because I want to get to the prizes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one says, number one,
130.3 metric tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Colorado's annual demand for
marijuana equal to 36.8 million eighths of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every year, Colorado sells and or
smokes 36.8 million eighths.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of eighths.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're buying them at a shop,
that's averaging you about $65 to $70 an
[SPEAKER_01]: eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of freaking money we're
bringing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, makes you wonder how many
Coloradans how many Coloradoans use
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to that is 485,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number of adults who are 21 and
older using marijuana regularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they account for at least once a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about 9% of the state's
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says, and what about those
using more often than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 23%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the amount of Colorado's user
population that consumes cannabis nearly
[SPEAKER_01]: daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in my club, 23% of us,
we're in the 23 club.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke cannabis on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about the out-of-state tourists
visiting Colorado that purchase legal
[SPEAKER_01]: weed?
90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the amount of recreational pot
sales out-of-state tourists are
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for at shops in mountain town
resort communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're saying places like Breck and
Vale, 90% of pot sales are from
[SPEAKER_01]: out-of-state tourists.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my neighborhood, in our area,
what we have observed, I'm going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: about 70% of the people that stop into the
spot dispensary are from out-of-state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say 50% of the people are
from Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what we have observed being in
the place a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one says, but how much of
Colorado's annual demand are these
[SPEAKER_01]: tourists actually buying?
[SPEAKER_01]: 7%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the amount of Colorado's annual pot
demand purchased by out-of-state tourists.
[SPEAKER_01]: 9% is the price drop on a recreational
eighth of marijuana at a dozen percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip over a couple of these
because they're just ridiculous numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, jeez, has that a million?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: $246,810,599.03 is the state's total
recreational marijuana sales as counted
[SPEAKER_01]: from January to October, because November
and December data was not available at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time of this article from the Colorado
Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So $246 million, you guys, that's nine
digits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your hundreds, you got your
thousands, your 100,000, your 10,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: your 100,000, then you got these other
three digits over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two commas in that set of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of damn money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, you're going to ask,
what about total medical sales?
[SPEAKER_01]: $326,716,273.59.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys fathom that much money?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nine digits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of money, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Colorado's total medical marijuana
sales also from January to October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody do some math on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's $572 million, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: $572 million we made on cannabis,
legal cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, that's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine where that was going before we had
legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, a lot of it is coming from
out-of-state people and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but imagine where that money was going
before we had legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was that going?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was happening with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next number is 103,918.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number of medical marijuana
patients reporting severe pain as their
[SPEAKER_01]: condition for a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 94% of the state's total patients are
using severe pain as their condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: which yeah, how can you deny severe pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the doctor and you say,
it hurts, he's going to go, I believe you,
[SPEAKER_01]: because he's a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's compassionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hell yeah, use that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick a spot and say it hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: $60.1 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the amount Colorado has brought in
via taxes, licenses, and fees on
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational and medical, I'm not going to
say marijuana, recreational and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis from January to October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So $60.1 million has been brought into the
state of Colorado just from taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses, and fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing was sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: No product passed hands that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply licensing and taxing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: $60.1 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the cannabis infused edibles,
the cookies and gummies and brownies that
[SPEAKER_01]: proved to be surprisingly popular in this
first year of recreational sales?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the answer is 10 milligrams of
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the state's standard single serving
size for marijuana edibles with a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams maximum allowed in an
individually packaged product being sold
[SPEAKER_01]: recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred milligram incredible bar is
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're from out of state and you're
coming here and you're going to buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred milligram edible, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't eat that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that that is a decent amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred milligrams is a good limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can buy multiple of those because
if you're out of state, you're allowed up
[SPEAKER_01]: to seven grams of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're allowed to divide that into
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, many milligrams are in that candy
bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a neat fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, and did any of these edibles end
up making for a crazy Halloween as some
[SPEAKER_01]: thought they would?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the response is zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number of reports of THC laced
candy given to trick or treaters on
[SPEAKER_01]: Halloween, regardless of widespread
concern that legal marijuana would lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: pot laced candies in children's Halloween
halls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody got ganja edibles because they're
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because if you bought it, you probably
ate it yourself and didn't want to give it
[SPEAKER_01]: to some kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are 12 interesting facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Statistics, I guess they are from the
state of Colorado for the first year of
[SPEAKER_01]: legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got one more article.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from a part of this happened in
my hometown in the lovely, lovely town of
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I have said stop shipping
cannabis because this dude got caught and
[SPEAKER_01]: he is going to get fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he'll probably get fucked after
that, but I'm not going to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article is from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says police found $63,000 in
marijuana and pot products in a UPS
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the headline is Pueblo police
Texas man arrested after trying to ship 63
[SPEAKER_01]: K of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a picture of a table with a,
it looks like this dude has a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: eights and they're rolled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know those are probably ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I'm trying to zoom in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got ounces and they're wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those ounces are all shoved into
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like he's got one,
two, three, four of those ounces per bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's got one, two, three,
four, five.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like eight of them on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever I just pushed made the thing
refresh, but yeah, he's got several pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another picture of a
bunch of edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a monkey bar on there,
which was one of my favorite edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of a bunch of really
popular edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Ahatma concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like this dude was trying to
send the goods back to Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's read about what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those articles by Jesse Paul from the
Denver Post, I found it on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the Texas man was arrested
Wednesday on suspicion of trying to send
[SPEAKER_01]: himself an estimated $63,000 in marijuana
and marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of which was legally purchased from
Pueblo back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious because they say $63,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Texas price or was that the price
at the dispensary when he bought it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that street price or is that DEA
markup price?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I say this guy's name?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read his name in the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to because that makes him
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to get credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny Wolf was arrested by the San Angelo
Police Department in Texas at his
[SPEAKER_01]: residence and is being held at the Tom
Green County Jail in lieu of $100,000 cash
[SPEAKER_01]: only bond, Pueblo police said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wolf has been charged with possession of
marijuana with intent to distribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where the article gets interesting
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The police in Pueblo began investigating
Wolf early last month after United Parcel
[SPEAKER_01]: Service employees reported receiving a
package that was suspicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The package was sent by Wolf out of Pueblo
to himself at an address in San Angelo,
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what makes a package
suspicious because they show a picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: this guy and this dude's got long hair and
he looks like he'd be a rowdy Texas
[SPEAKER_01]: troublemaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, dude, I just called you out,
but you do, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dreadlocks too, but I know what it's
like, but you look like fucking trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that was all it took to make
him suspicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and the fact that he sent the package
to himself in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I'm Justin Wolf and I want to
send this to Justin Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might've been it, but I'll keep
reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says inside police found several double
vacuum sealed packages with the total of
[SPEAKER_01]: nine pounds of high grade marijuana,
police said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigators say the package also had
cannabis edibles, cough syrup,
[SPEAKER_01]: skin patches, and wax concentrate that had
been legally purchased from two separate
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police estimate the marijuana to be worth
$58,000 and the cannabis products worth to
[SPEAKER_01]: be $5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo police say they drafted a warrant
on Tuesday for Wolf's arrest and contacted
[SPEAKER_01]: police in Texas who arrested him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually read this article somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they already have a team in
Texas that works on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way they just called their bros,
you know, hey, we got another one guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just went and picked him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point, the reason I'm reading this
article, stop fucking shipping things out
[SPEAKER_01]: of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are fucking it up for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a good thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want some weed, come get it and
enjoy it while you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want weed while you're at home in
Texas or North Carolina or Alabama or
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking Arkansas, do what you got to do to
make cannabis legal there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't come here and mail yourself some
shit to your state and fuck it up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're fucking it up for yourself
because you're going to go to jail and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're thwarting your legalization efforts
in your own place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have spent that energy,
that time, and that money legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my rant on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't send shit in the mail, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is going to go to prison and he's
got long hair and he's a skinny white
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will not do well in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the same build.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go to prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ship some shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll quit bitching at you about shipping
shit because most of the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to the show aren't the people that
are going to ship some stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll quit bitching at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it is time to get to the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how long the show has been
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 37 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't given out any prizes yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, let's do this.

[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for entering the contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't win, I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like doing contests because that
means that somebody didn't win and I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like shit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you didn't win, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel guilty already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't feel bad that you didn't win.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to pick winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only had so many prizes and I had a lot
of entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to everybody that entered the
contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to everybody that listened to
the podcast.

this little show that happens here in my
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen at my dining room table has placed
888 out of 25,000 shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not me that did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you guys, because I don't listen to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just produce it and record it and talk

that I did not list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look over there one more
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I realized that there's another
prize pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to peek across the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four bags over there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only gave away three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that meant that I had an extra bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that extra bag has Heavy 16 nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's IRE genetic stickers in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Heavy 16 stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's random shit from Hygro under

[SPEAKER_01]: So El Rocho, bro, I need your contact
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you won the prize that I forgot to
list because you commented on the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since there's another one,
bro, you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So message me and I'll get that to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking really fast, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is almost over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pause for the last dab because I
needed a drink so badly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourselves a dab, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the email going, so I'm already
ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dab some Sativa mix that I
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Garden of Whedon and
Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and Big Mike helped a lot,
and Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys have got me making pretty good
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a dab, wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, two, one, let's dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have been bigger than I wanted to
take on the podcast, but we'll be all
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to tell one quick story
before I wrap it up because I just hit my
[SPEAKER_01]: hitman rig and it made me think of
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday, I straight dropped and broke a
$300 hitman face two cake, and it hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: table and it just fucking broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know everyone's going, oh my God,
really you broke a $300 rig?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like a real dumb ass about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of had like a moment of guilt in my
heart for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sat at the table and I was like,
you just dropped one of your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: rigs, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's broken glass on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be mad for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be brokenhearted, but then you got
to grab the broom and the dust pan and
[SPEAKER_01]: sweep up the fucking broken glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to throw that glass in the trash
and you got to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I could do because it's broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't glue it back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Duct tape is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a moment of Zen as I was sweeping
up this broken glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought there's so many things that
happen in your life that suck and they
[SPEAKER_01]: hurt, or maybe they're good, but you can't
cling to things because you could drop
[SPEAKER_01]: that glass at any minute and that shit
could break, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't put it back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you just got to sweep some
shit up, throw out the trash can and
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking walk away and just move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have some shit happen to you,
just try to learn something and think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it like that because I've been stuck
on something and breaking that rig was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely symbolic in some way to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned something from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke a rig and I learned a huge life
lesson from it that had nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: the rig itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, this moment of Zen came over me
and taught me a huge life lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you learned something from it also.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's something that you're fucking
stuck on that you're clinging to,
[SPEAKER_01]: just let it go, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's easier said than done,
but I dropped a $300 rig and I swept it up
[SPEAKER_01]: and threw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing we can do about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you got to sweep some shit up
and move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get cut from the rig and I had
fun hitting it when I hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, you guys,
now that the show's over, please go to
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes or Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the iTunes or the Stitcher main

[SPEAKER_01]: happens, that's where that money goes.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, a pro grower,
if you're a new smoker, or if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
activist, or if you're just someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, and it's time
for episode number 53.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a hard time breathing because
we just took some fat dabs in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's looking at me like,
yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting on my left, we've got King Kola
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right in front of me into my left a
little bit, I'm going to say the 11 o
[SPEAKER_01]: 'clock position is my new friend,
Alan.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over here, the guy who I want to call
somebody else because I was told somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: else was coming, but my good friend Nick
is over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promised you guys Jay would be here,
but instead of Jay, he sent three minions
[SPEAKER_01]: in his place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how important that dude is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me three guys, and we've been
sitting here at the table bullshitting for
[SPEAKER_01]: a few minutes, and these guys know they're
worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ready to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready to talk wormage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got all the worm puns figured out
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have heard the worm puns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, guys, I got to give
a big thanks to shout out thanks to Ku and
[SPEAKER_01]: Kat from the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They allow me to play their music at the
start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is cool as shit because playing music
on a podcast is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds weird, but you got to
pay to play people's music on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you got to do that, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Music should be free, free, free,
free freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Royalties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Royalties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are royalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the kings of cannabis, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Art is not free anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the artist has got to get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Kat and Ku for letting me play
their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you just pulled out a cool surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The solvent list.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to totally interrupt the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon headed stranger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude, that is terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Tricholm heavy, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tricholm heavy extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that totally derailed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do an ad for Hygro,
but- It's like lemon paint thinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon paint thinner.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figured out a good way to dab that one.

[SPEAKER_01]: He's a real cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you hear us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect to all the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to announce it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our new sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the official name?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is now brought to you by the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to say yet because I
have not written a commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you worming with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do worm, son.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could go on forever with that I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be some cool worm puns going on
pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, those guys are going to help me
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to contribute organics and
they're going to, part of their
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsorship, they don't know it,
but I'm going to sucker them into teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: me how to throw away my bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to get me working with all
organics that will be supplied by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of my grow equipment will come from
Hygro and all of my organic supplies will
[SPEAKER_01]: come from the Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be killing it with the
sponsorship help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are, you've changed my growing
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using a lot more Grokashi,
a lot of worm castings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a question about that coming
up for you in just a couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can almost get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read the commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys showed up early, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three paw heads showed up to my house
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be a perfect question since
you guys are from the organic side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking about Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually gave some Grokashi away in a
prize package recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my listeners, a lot of the
listeners have been asking how to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read the instructions and it says to
fill up your reservoir with however many
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add a third of a cup of Kashi
and then you mix in, I don't remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: specific amount of molasses, but you mix
in a specific amount of molasses per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you let it sit for 24 to 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that, I use that, excuse my cough
guys, we took some gnarly dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that's mixed, I use that and just
water it into the top of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have other ways that you
prefer or recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys want to take that?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is Alan on the mic just so
that you know who you're listening to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it in your tees, top dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get your mycelium going on the top
layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, sometimes you want to put a
mulch down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to get too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to watch out with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely have seen results layering
it in your pot as you transplant.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some dirt, then some Kashi,
then some dirt, then some Kashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you're doing, whatever your
organic heart desires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since you're in there throwing some
worm castings, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm castings everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a difference in my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been using them for a week in my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wanting more water more often
because they're growing so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they're learning how to eat
by themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're starting to cycle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what you're doing is when you're
growing synthetically, you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: bypassing this entire organic life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're just cutting everything
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just shooting it up instead of
feeding it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's actually why hydro
growers have to supplement with so much
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no CO2 produced in the
decomposition of the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the number in front of me,
but I've been doing some research lately,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah, there's actually a significant
amount of CO2 put off running like a
[SPEAKER_05]: no-till system in larger containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taught science, but it's not
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been done for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes back to the Bokashi.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bokashi has been around forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not science.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between Bokashi and
Grokashi?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll take a hit because you looked
at me like I'm a puss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't need the cotton mouth on the
show here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like the Band-Aid brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grokashi is kind of taken over the
industry like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Grokashi is Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just Grokashi makes their own mix of
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bokashi is nothing but a... A brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, basically it's a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be any medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use sticks or stems or oak brand,
just any sort of carbon-based material.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're going to inoculate it with
typically yeast, photosynthetic bacteria,
[SPEAKER_05]: and lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an EM1.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're familiar, you follow our feeds
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probiotic Farmers Alliance stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm not mistaken, Grokashi actually
adds in glacial rock dust for trace
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of what makes up their mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company will actually
start carrying their own Bokashi here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can add a lot to your Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ours will actually be inoculated with
humic acid, some local animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically you'll get a little piece of
our gardens in yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of love spread around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to try to keep it local.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky Mountain Natural Farm is trying to
keep everything in Colorado, bring back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's important, especially in the
cannabis community, to give back to
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see it a lot in other states that
have been doing it a little longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their community is a little bit more
integrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in NorCal, a lot of people... That's
how farming should work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a specialized product, but it's
definitely farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an artisan product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes with anything, with wine,
cheese, meats.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... You should have...
Instruments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instruments, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Computers, cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should want the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with organic practices, that's what
you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: In actual medicine, that's a cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not smoking anything that shouldn't
be in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MAP and DAP.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean just gave me the, yeah, get away from
the MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me want to get back to the how
to use the Grokashi though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to leave them without some
sort of...
[SPEAKER_05]: I was definitely going to come back
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd definitely try to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, for me personally,
if you just want me to tell you how I use
[SPEAKER_05]: Grokashi...
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're great at this field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, when I do my initial
transplant out of a Red Solo Cup,
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil mix traditionally, because I make
my own soils, will have Grokashi in it
[SPEAKER_05]: already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or my own form of Bokashi or Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll have it in the soil mix,
but I always top dress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I transplant, always top dress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually it's with a cover crop,
a little bit of Grokashi, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: worm castings, and then I'll just water it
in with a product we carry that's called
[SPEAKER_05]: SeaCrop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically, it's kind of like
fermented seawater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your fish?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not a fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say I use this in place,
traditionally, if you're familiar with
[SPEAKER_05]: full power.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of use it in the place of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a lot of fulvic acids,
a lot of trace minerals, a lot of things
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're not going to get from your
basic- Well, you see a lot of coastal
[SPEAKER_05]: growers use- Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a micronutrient bottle to
use, so we use SeaCrop.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so I usually water in with the
SeaCrop right after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll roll into, basically after
that, it'll be every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go through and do a Grokashi Dreg,
which is basically what you're referring
[SPEAKER_05]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do mine a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I like to do is use a grinded
herb, traditionally like a Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll use a, take basically,
if I'm doing a 10 gallon thing of tea or a
[SPEAKER_05]: Grokashi Dreg, so I'll take my Dragonfly
Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll mix it in there, depending on,
you know, flour, veg, radiant green,
[SPEAKER_05]: or flat flour, dump that in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have those, you can use
alfalfa for kelp.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I dump that in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It usually at whatever recommended rate
you're going to run a tea with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I add in a fourth a cup of,
you know, Grokashi per gallon,
[SPEAKER_05]: a fourth a cup of worm castings per
gallon, and then one teaspoon of,
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on what stage, I'll either use
molasses or yucca in just some sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: carbohydrate source.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I seal it up and then forget
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say like 12 to 24 hours, but in my
personal experience, nothing is wrong with
[SPEAKER_05]: taking a 14 days ferment.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fermenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, as long as- You want it to go a
little longer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Rule of thumb, if it smells bad,
it is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're, if you're familiar with- Your
nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probiotics, kimchi, things like that,
you'll start to learn what good ferments
[SPEAKER_05]: are, what bad ferments are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want that almost sweet,
bitter, and not funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like a pickling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the, once the fish smell overpowers,
then it's funk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as far as- Do you want to seal it
up also, you said?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I usually do is, everybody's probably
got a bunch of Panda film laying around
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I usually do is cut a big square
or have a big square Panda film that was
[SPEAKER_05]: left over from like a floor or a door or
something I made.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just lay it over the container and
wrap it in string and tie it tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it doesn't have to be- Organics is
not fancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is, this is all in my
basement at the home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't steal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would have happened by nature running
down a hill into a big shitty puddle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not fancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea is that we're going to try to
balance out aerobic and anaerobic
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And nature both exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you were, for the exact reason,
you were saying things fall on the ground,
[SPEAKER_05]: they decay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have puddles of stagnant water,
animals dying, hot spots in the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by introducing these things on a
regular basis, I've, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that that's where we're kind of
getting a biological edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a difference in my plants and I know
it's only been a couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just feeding them, they're more
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are ready to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, so you've got your protozoa cycle
nutrients, your fungal hypha, the bacteria
[SPEAKER_05]: content, there's nematodes in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're just getting this term.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's funny because, you know,
you go to the hydros store and you see
[SPEAKER_05]: that they sell nematodes and you see that
they sell great white and you see that
[SPEAKER_05]: they sell OG tea and they sell all of
these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you take some time to go to
a vacuum out worm company's website.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually look it up and you'll see
that all of these things are already in
[SPEAKER_05]: your worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can make your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take five small scoops of worm
castings in a five gallon bucket of water,
[SPEAKER_01]: of good clean water, reverse osmosis
clean, dechlorinated water, and bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit for like 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've just made great white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've made all of those products on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say that if you're new to
making teas, or even if you're familiar
[SPEAKER_05]: with making teas, with worm castings,
a lot of people use we use like an Alaskan
[SPEAKER_05]: humus from General Organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are different things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Traditionally, they're using one cup per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't waste your, like,
you're just going to be wasting money and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to be creating a mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are very powerful worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: A fourth a cup per gallon is all you're
going to need with J's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to write that down because I
don't, I think I used more to tell you the
[SPEAKER_05]: truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it written down in the grill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, that's one, I would even go
one cup per five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to keep it real simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's, you're going to get
every result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to leave some room for foam,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave room for foam, because that's just
going to foam up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you, if you do have a problem with
the foam, you can always add in some sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of like a fat lipid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could use like a fish hydrus,
it'll take it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neem oil, caraja oil, coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I put neem oil in there, how much would
I use?
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, to take away foam, you would
just kind of like drip it off your finger
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the bottle and it'll just kind of
go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend more, let's just throw
in a, plants love coconut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, coconut water,
coconut powder, if you can get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you eat them and you, you know,
buy them at the supermarket, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: grab an extra one and throw it in every so
often.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I would throw a tea,
like if your stuff's foaming up too bad,
[SPEAKER_05]: throw a little bit of coconut oil in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your plants will like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Foam will go away, keep your floor nice
and clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, buy a drip tray twice the size of
your brewer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or brew it in like a Rubbermaid container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics can get hands on and a little
messy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to, when I started, I've been
through every nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss back in the day mixing 42 bottles
of advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like the mad scientist looking for
the perfect mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I can do it with my organics with
the help of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I first started growing was
with bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, my first grow, I,
I'll admit it, I messed those plants up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish I had went with organics,
but I was nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now after actually, you know,
practicing it and going hands on and just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of diving in, and after reading a lot
of the books, you know, they help,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you get to the end of them and it's
like, this is just life and just what,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, has been happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what you've learned in,
in science class.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, going a little
farther beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where like the Korean farming
comes into, you know, that that's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more hands on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you, you know, start somewhere
small with worm castings, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a big step in your gardening
practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're trying to get hardcore into it
and you want to be complete, completely
[SPEAKER_05]: self-sufficient and we can help you do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can help you to where you, you'll never
have to go to the high dry store.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll never have to come to Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll never have to rely on anybody to
grow your own plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to do that, you're going to
have to start somewhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's somewhere is worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've jumped in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you start with that base and then
you'll start to understand, okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is why I'm mixing it in with the
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of stuff starts to make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to see like- Root growth
on your plants after you transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: How beautiful everything looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root bags for this run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're coming out of the bottoms
vigorously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually those roots that fall out of
the holes like that, they die off,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're still reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're crawling around the room on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can find some more, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're stoked about life in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little shop of horrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got huge roots now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're white.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super, super white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two applications of worm castings is
really all it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be afraid to use the worm
castings in the soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, when you transplant- 10% is
what I typically go with for my personal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take for those worm
castings to become bio available to my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say theoretically,
instantaneously.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not- There's no breakdown time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no MPK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is an MPK value, but that's not
why you're using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're adding them, the reason
that you're going to get, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: say instant results, but results so quick
is because when you introduce those,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not like, it's not like a
fertilizer that you're waiting to be
[SPEAKER_05]: absorbed by the root.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just dropped a spaceship in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are little worms in these worm
castings, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are little tiny baby worms in the
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get some worms in your castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells you that, that tells me that
that shit is alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that worm was alive in there,
it got shipped, they were packaged in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, I bought it in Pueblo
with high grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it in my, in my car for a day before
I even was able to bring it in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can't haul in all the gross shit
during the day, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say though, when purchasing worm
castings, the first thing you want to do
[SPEAKER_05]: is seal them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to put them in a sealed container
cause they will dry out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's one of the words you'll
waste a lot of money doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause once they dry out, then they're no
better than anything off of store shelves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just that packaged stuff at the
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all dusty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can see my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now someone came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like playing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that in the last episode,
I said, they smell so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it would, but it's,
I said, it smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said that people are going to make,
think I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I said, it smells good, but I love
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of why I grow dirt still is
cause I love the smell of good dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a dirt warrior.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I came to Colorado, it like hurt
my soul to not see dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just the East coast,
we have loamy soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice coastal loamy soil, a lot of
decomposition, trees, all that water and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of deciduous forests that not die
off and dust.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get out of, I haven't been out of
Pueblo much here lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got to get in the car and go to
Manitou with us one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just go on random trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take that back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been to Denver a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had any time to stop and enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best place I've been to was Estes
park.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the closest that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a Manitou junkie though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime I get a chance, it's the Pate
factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a little walk on Manitou avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go visit the poppy seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a chiropractor up there that
charges a dollar a minute, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He pops one of my favorite people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He pops her back once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drive up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows that we work at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows that that's where his patient
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fan of the arcade up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is better than when you can just cut
loose, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for people who don't do hard drugs,
how do we cut loose?
[SPEAKER_05]: We go play penny video games.
[SPEAKER_02]: What our parents used to do in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are turning into old people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: My back hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: My knees crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when you could get up without
making sound effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I walk up the stairs,
I'm like crack, crack, crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to just joint one in my hand all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You aren't sneaking up on anybody,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Alan's coming up the stairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So aside from the drag we go, I'm just
trying to stay on track.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I like to let it go a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like jam band music.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let it go for a minute,
some gold may just come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't after a minute,
I'll put you back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you're going to be recycling soil
and organics, and you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay sustainable, you can put it in your
soil bins when you're recycling your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: to help break down organic matter in
there, such as leaves and stalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold dead roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root balls, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a top layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix it in while you're covering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mulch is my next step.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mulch is definitely something I need
to contribute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as mixing Bukashi into your
soil, traditionally it's 2% by volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 2 gallons for 200 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to have to build a
trough or something, or buy a rez or
[SPEAKER_01]: something to mix up your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tarp on the ground works, but it's low
down and it's hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kitty pools are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then buckets, and then store it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big ass trash cans.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you guys see that white stuff growing
on your soil, don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see people open it up and see that white
growth and throw their shit away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mix your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grab some Groukashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're going to re-amend your soil,
make sure Groukashi in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put your amendments in there, like you
were saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mix it up in a kitty pool or on a tarps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put them up in a Rubbermaid container.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what I would recommend doing is
swinging by J's and picking up either
[SPEAKER_05]: cocoons, or if you really want to,
it's a lot of fun, but live worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And throw them in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just let them go to town.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because either they're going to die or
they're going to survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: They self-populate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll either get in there,
they'll do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your soil is optimal and is running how
it should, your worms will reproduce and
[SPEAKER_02]: you will have an active soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do help, but I know Sean's had
experience with them kind of over-furting
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant with breaking down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they find hot spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say that you mix your soil and
you're like, dang, I don't know if I did
[SPEAKER_05]: that good enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe throw some worms in there and they
tend to find hot spots and they'll work
[SPEAKER_05]: their way through it and they tend to
break it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, actually I went into one of my
rooms and saw some test plants with a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the tips of the leaves were kind of
pointing at the ground and they were a
[SPEAKER_05]: little dark green.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feed them anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is this happening?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was actually alfalfa hay that I
mulch or that I used to mulch with.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the worms went crazy in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Started just eating the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess they cycled it and it burnt my
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't burn my plant, but it was taking
up a lot of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was, it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really kind of- So you can kind of
overdo it with organics as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't, yeah, you really want
to be less is more with organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to know what breaks down in what
fashion and how long it takes to break
[SPEAKER_02]: down and, you know, knowing your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't run one plant, one cycle in
organics and give up because you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to dial that in and it's,
it might take one or two runs,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then whatever your best friend told
you to mix your soil at, do it at half
[SPEAKER_05]: that rate because it's way easier to fix
the deficiency than this to flush out some
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of something that you put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to say yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been working really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of revamping inventory we're
carrying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon we'll be cover crops will be
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: All amendments will be available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have herbal inoculants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not just, we'll be able to offer things
like alfalfa meal, crustacean meal,
[SPEAKER_05]: oyster shell powder, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all food grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all organic, but we'll also be
carrying aloe vera powder, freeze-dried
[SPEAKER_05]: coconut powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all organic cold process.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's of the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll also be starting to carry,
I don't know if we can grind the herbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we start saying that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we say that we're going to start
powderizing herbs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company in the next
few months is definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: changing a face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing is set in stone yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't say anything definite,
but the community is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot more things available to them
for their organic needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep an eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow our Instagram, Rocky Mountain Worm
Company.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start doing experiments of
powderizing our own.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will have, I would say,
April is going to be the big kickoff date.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be at the Cannabis Cup some fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't miss me with the beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Colorado, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of beards now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, I'll have some type of hat on if
I don't have my BMO hat on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Rocky Mountain Worm Company,
they'll be getting a booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then potentially around that time,
we'll have some new info that they want to
[SPEAKER_05]: release as far as, like I said,
us carrying a new product, us releasing
[SPEAKER_05]: feeding charts.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a lot of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can come and catch us at the cup if
you- Come by the Rocky Mountain Worm
[SPEAKER_01]: Company booth, guys, because I will be
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to schedule probably a good
two hour block each day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cup is three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably pick two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to do different times or maybe
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to meet as many people
as I can, but that's a landmark for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try to come back on here one more
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime- Oh, we got plenty of
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let Jeff know when you want him there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, dude, noon to two or like- Well,
I got to get into the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to stand in line for three hours
before we can even get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after I get in the cup, I'll just go to
your guys' booth and I'll be there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just come find us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you're going to need a place to sit
down, dab at.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have some water for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I started partying in the line last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out of the dab rig and started
dabbing people out in line and the cops
[SPEAKER_01]: were standing there just looking at us
like, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The booth will potentially have some
really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have some example containers of all
of our cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have an example of all of the
amendments and things out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have some flowers there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll definitely have samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have plenty of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been one of the stoniest episodes
we've recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a joint burning the entire
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are rolling up cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to light up another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is the homegrown using the Rocky
Mountain worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you guys showed up with,
showed up with smells and looks and tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to keep it connoisseur quality and
what you should be smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of cut you off a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were about to hype out the Instagram
for Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us how we can find the worm company
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll do that again at the end of the
show too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since you were almost there,
I want to let you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Rocky Mountain Worm Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky and then MTN Worm Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can check Sean out on Rocky
Mountain Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a little, what's that
called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Underscore?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Rocky MTN Underscore Natural Farming
or King Underscore Cola Underscore.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll work a link out so you can just find
all of us after the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this episode goes out, I'll try to
post up all of those in the listing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I post up to Instagram and Twitter and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully people will find you and
follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any parchment paper,
but who wants a little fingerprint dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fingerprint dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep it real organic in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll take a fingerprint dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That smells like some turpeous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Jibs and Ken from THE.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jibs is an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out at they just one second place at
the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll be at the Denver Cup for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they'll be running some more
of Growing Kush One Mile High stuff and he
[SPEAKER_05]: will be stopping by the Worm Company booth
also.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll come back with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to schedule hopefully some
times for you guys to come by and meet
[SPEAKER_05]: some of your favorite growers and standers
at the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a lot of people in
Denver, so it's going to be a real
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing Kush One Mile High, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll have to try to talk to you
down here one day, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dirty low.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can meet us in Colorado Springs and
mob down with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just got a gift for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, see?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even more of an incentive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gifts are always a work of drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of gifts, I have to reach for a
business card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I put that business?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let you do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kind of guest on the show,
my new friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to write down his name because I
totally expected Jay and I wanted to call
[SPEAKER_01]: him Jay all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Nick, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought me a killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wire wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a hippie, if you're a Wook,
dude, this is the most killer wire wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot identify the Jasper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's Jasper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a red yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picasso Jasper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picasso Jasper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'll remember the artist Picasso.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's red, yellow, and green Jasper wrapped
in a really sweet wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a wrap that style.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is from Clear Sky Creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check him out on Etsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I say the artist's real name?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Elise?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out this artist, Elise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Elise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am wearing this with pride.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody in the crew has got like
four.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a thing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of us all have links to her on
our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you scroll through, we've all got shots
of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go through our pages, check our stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put a lot of posts of what we're doing
and how we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not hiding anything from anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't nothing that isn't already
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not tell someone how to do it as
long as they're willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just check our stuff out and we're
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for this fingerprint dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells fingerprinty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get you like 10 times higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to ask a question now so that
somebody will talk while I dab this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know about, I want to start a
compost bin and I've got some worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings now and I don't have,
obviously I live in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to use that little space right over
there by the trash can maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you guys help me start my own little
compost bin like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, as far as our first
sponsorship agreement, I'll bring you down
[SPEAKER_05]: a Bukashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll start you some anaerobic compost
and then we'll also get you set up on a
[SPEAKER_05]: actual compost pile for more of a
traditional system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can finally start to recycle all
your leftover avocados, your banana peels,
[SPEAKER_05]: egg shells, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're vegan, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not vegan, but vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the worm castings are vegetarians as
well, besides some minerals that they eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people that are worried about that,
don't be afraid to put it in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important nowadays I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to all the vegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys, I was off mic for a second
taking one of these delicious dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to turn the nail up to make
it burn better, but I want to turn it down
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a toss up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot, there's a slogan they have for
that, you know, waste it to taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a dabber, I'm a flower guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate us because they ain't us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peanut butter and jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friend that watched that
movie with me twice this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the interview, James Franco
and Seth Rogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They killed that movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first few minutes I wanted to
smack Franco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, he's going to ruin this movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the director must've pulled him
aside and been like, tone it down to
[SPEAKER_01]: seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on 11, let's just go to seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now you're just going to let that
man do what he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he, if no one's watched Freaks and
Geeks, it's an older show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not too old because we're
not that old here, but it's a great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's old school Franco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen an actor spit so much in a
scene before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the movie though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like they perfectly did the
Lord of the Rings references.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was needed in that movie,
but that was just a beautiful movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was glad that Netflix put that on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get you a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start you with an anaerobic compost
so we can start recycling all of your
[SPEAKER_05]: kitchen scrap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as far as your plant waste,
different materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that, we can also show you how to
recycle those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what you're going to want,
what I would recommend doing would be,
[SPEAKER_05]: so you want to start a compost bin,
take a leftover pot from last season,
[SPEAKER_05]: start out with a nice soil base,
just dump it in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just feel free to start adding
stuff, you know, throw stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep a bucket in like a five gallon
bucket in my back door and I'll just throw
[SPEAKER_05]: things into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every couple of days I'll walk
that out to the actual compost pile in my
[SPEAKER_05]: backyard and then dump that in there,
throw some worm cast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically I do for per like five gallon
bucket full, I'll do like a handful of
[SPEAKER_05]: worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the secret is brewer's yeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you throw brewer's yeast onto the pile.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you really want to Bokashi
grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Buena Tea, the company, they're fungal,
they're compost Excel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a worm castings kelp and
brewer's yeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be amazed what you can find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, how do you know all this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, if you turn the bottle
around, just read the back, read what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if it says it and you're like,
wait, kelp, brewer's yeast, alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of this stuff I see at the store,
it's going by it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yucca extract, molasses, you can try to
source it from somewhere that is sourcing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And naturally, whether they grow it
sustainably or they've been growing it for
[SPEAKER_02]: a while, you might not be able to get it
from where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, someone is making it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want it, it might be,
you know, if you can't find it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not looking hard enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Craigslist, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Google.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Backwoods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those people are your friends now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you want barley straw,
you want hay, you want manures,
[SPEAKER_05]: you want compost, you want anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Find someone that's feeding there.
[SPEAKER_05]: People who look at, go on Craigslist,
people want to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll pay you to come and get the hell
out of their yard.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I got all of my alfalfa hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the guy had to scrape his horse
pins.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're familiar with
horses, but they scrape the pins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went and collected that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got a lot of the alfalfa hay that I
ran in my last grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got repurposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't get thrown in a landfill and it
got to grow some great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last grow, I was really like motivated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To make all of my own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really motivated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I learned how to kind of source it from
everywhere for just about free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that mean that you've kind of
murdered yourself trying to be so
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you slow yourself down?
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that basically all I had to pay
for last grow was power.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have any other money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organics keeps your pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: The past like half a year has been a
little rough and I didn't have all the
[SPEAKER_05]: money to really do what we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was, let's buy fruits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take the cores and the skins and the
pits and let's make a plant juice out of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, oh, I can grow micro greens and
peas and sprouts and I can eat them in my
[SPEAKER_05]: sandwiches, but I can also ferment and use
them as a tea additive or a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing with my eggs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm buying eggs from the store.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to save my eggshells because I
can use that with apple cider vinegar,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'm already buying because I drink
it for health reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wash my dreadlocks with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just mix that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you brown eggshell, crush them up,
brown some eggshells, mix it with apple
[SPEAKER_05]: cider vinegar, water-soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can make everything in your grow
with nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got to learn where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Learn where nature would have provided it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're hungry and you need... So if you
and your plants are hungry at the same
[SPEAKER_05]: time, what I recommend doing is cruising
on down to your local Asian market and
[SPEAKER_05]: grabbing you some black fish.
[SPEAKER_05]: The darker, the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the exact reason,
but I would just go with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you go and get you some... That's
what Dr. Chow said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you just got to go with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's kind of the founder of natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so you can take some... So yeah,
literally go and buy you some fish,
[SPEAKER_05]: clean it, eat what you want, whatever's
left over, blend it, typically with like a
[SPEAKER_05]: brown sugar, blend it all up together.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then seal it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 30 days, strain it, add IMO,
which is indigenous microorganisms or EM1
[SPEAKER_05]: or lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of those will really work in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one thing about organic
gardening and sourcing things locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to help your plant fight off a
lot of different diseases, pests that are
[SPEAKER_02]: found in your region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you be growing outside, use a lot of
different IMOs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be having a... Maybe we'll get
into that a little more in another
[SPEAKER_05]: episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be having a class.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say it's a class.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go ahead and mention it on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to start doing classes,
but we need to know who wants to come to
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let us know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to try to schedule a meet
and greet before this month is over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe up in Colorado Springs, where if you
listen to us, you follow us on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've heard about the shop, you want to
talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to meet you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're important to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get all of that stuff situated
now that we're a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll hear from Jeff's show when that's
ready.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep you guys posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to announce when that stuff's
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do another night like that
at Hygro also in the future, but Jesse's
[SPEAKER_01]: been booked busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually talked to Jesse about the
potential of us teaming up and maybe doing
[SPEAKER_05]: some classes together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get hands on with everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff is so good at just articulating what
needs to be done to like basic,
[SPEAKER_05]: just, I mean, really anybody, he can tell
anybody how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping he was going to be here
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know they're doing some like really
cool classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they did like cloning last time
and some really like awesome introduction
[SPEAKER_05]: classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping we can kind of team up and
maybe do some more advanced classes for
[SPEAKER_05]: the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start off easy and then go into the heavy
stuff and the people can get your feet
[SPEAKER_01]: wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if they come to our, if you come to us
and you feel like maybe you need to eat
[SPEAKER_05]: something, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we're a little over your head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Contact Hygro and Jesse and they'll tell
you, they'll walk you through the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll teach you how to clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll teach you how to pH or whatever
you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then whenever you feel comfortable,
are you ready?
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and yeah, I try to keep stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you follow me on Instagram,
the big token underscore, underscore kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of try to keep things simple so everybody
can kind of grasp it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, from there you can
delve into a little bit more because a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of growers, you know, when they use bottle
nutrients, they go to the Hygro store and
[SPEAKER_02]: they ask, you know, what do I need to
grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you know, what are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, you got to do
some research to be a grower and your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants will appreciate that and you'll
notice it in your results at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'll explain things,
but I'll let you, you know, open your mind
[SPEAKER_02]: to it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be running a lot of
examples with products that we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be carrying and research and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's with Sean's page two and the
Rocky Mountain Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep an eye out and just be part
of the community.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, especially when you're in
Colorado, if you want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: link up and talk organics, you know,
we're always around.
[SPEAKER_02]: When is the shop open?
[SPEAKER_02]: The shop is open during, during the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get there before, before like two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little earlier in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a 10 to four, I think,
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay is usually there, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone number's on the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's there basically every day of the week
from about 10 to four.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then outside of that, just email or
call or message him through Instagram and
[SPEAKER_05]: he'll meet you at 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or yeah, contact Nick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want it, we got you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can get you what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not just me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the people, the growers,
the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to call you customers,
but the shoppers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want them to know that the product's
out there, but the help's out there at the
[SPEAKER_05]: same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't feel like you're doing this alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have put me on the track to
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like without a couple of conversations
between Spence and Sean, I'd still be
[SPEAKER_01]: using the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nester.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
Nester, but Nester up in Denver,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's won a few cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the shop he used to grow for,
but that dude gave a talk one night about
[SPEAKER_01]: soil recycling and reconditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, you know, we can definitely
get on here again and have some more
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations and get into things a little
bit more in depth.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my one argument with organics,
all right, with your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you go to put it in your plant,
I want you to freaking drink it before you
[SPEAKER_05]: put it in your plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't feel comfortable doing
that, then don't use it on your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will eat anything in my garden right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the worm poop?
[SPEAKER_02]: You will perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will not have to pay me to ingest
something in the garden that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is how it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a patient, you medicate in many
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those ways is ingesting raw
cannabis as a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, juicing the leaves, the nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of beneficial for that with
pain fibromyalgia, you know, just with
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotics in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So releasing a lot of more of those
cannabinoids that aren't available that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can, you know, smoke or ingest through
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people can't take edibles or
ingest, and that's not what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, having a plant that you can
actually chew, you know, it's what should
[SPEAKER_02]: be like any vegetable or flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's indigestible.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's for medicine, I believe it should
be food grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's going to, if you're going to be
treating it as medicine, then it should be
[SPEAKER_05]: food grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recreational purposes, you know,
it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're going to be for example,
a medical dispensary, I'm calling you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quit using the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to know how to grow proper
cannabis for your dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_02]: get at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't need phosphate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they really don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's even other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I had a conversation about that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that off your shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take everything off your shelf and get
some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't even say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just people need to educate themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go jump into organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go and read every organic book and
buy everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's just as bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would almost say use synthetics instead
of bone meal or blood meal, because those
[SPEAKER_05]: are more harmful than they are good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with glacial rock dust,
soft rock phosphates, different things
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Azomites, they carry heavy metals and used
in large quantities like a lot of these
[SPEAKER_05]: super soils call for.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're putting the same, if not more heavy
metals into your plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you really want to educate yourself and
that's key.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to emphasize that if it's
for medical purposes and you won't ingest
[SPEAKER_05]: it yourself, if it's not food grade,
it's not medical grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can eat worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't recommend it, but the basis is
you're not going to get sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of where I'm coming from is
that if it says keep out of reach of
[SPEAKER_05]: children and it has a warning label of
what to do when you get it in your eyes,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if it can't touch my skin,
why can it touch my plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like people are just not aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, just educate yourselves and
not every organic option is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a slaughterhouse product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cow leftovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially depending on where you
source it from, a feather meal,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's even worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The McDonald's chicken farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover crops, barley and stuff like that
that you're going to use as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch out where you get that from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want any dyes or any pesticides
used with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 99% of corn is all GMO.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for your seed sprouted teas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was a weird noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens when that cord touches
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens when the email cord
touches the microphone or the headphone
[SPEAKER_01]: jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that was neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dab my eardrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all like a heartbeat in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody say something intelligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying, I forgot what we were talking
about real quick because that's sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just sitting around the table
taking dabs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what we're taking a dab of
right now, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, basically if you're really,
we're still on starting, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: running organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many avenues to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head is still making that noise from
the headphone jack after that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start off slow and don't read too many
books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go, like I said, source things that were
written a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a really good website called The
Unconventional Farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Gil Card again.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are really cool dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep it real simple and fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hands on.
[SPEAKER_02]: S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Squiggles WordPress.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cchar.org.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mountain Microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to dot coms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to dot orgs or edus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even then, you know, check where it
was sourced from, but just explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to go to the library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just stick to weed forums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not growing just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing a plant and this benefits
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this benefits you in every way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just, you want to touch on some
books real quick?
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we're right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Sean's apartment for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Touch my books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: T.
[SPEAKER_05]: L.
[SPEAKER_05]: O.
[SPEAKER_05]: True Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good beginner book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't follow it word for word.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is an, I mean, it's one of the best
books I've ever read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It teaches you what you can and can't use
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was detrimental in creating who I am
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the simple fact of that, it taught me
what things were, where they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: From, it really opened my eyes to how you
can create your own nutrients and all
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should just take everything at face
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time I mixed up my own
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the book I grabbed for
instructions.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my first jump into organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes right back though to,
you know, if you, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_05]: personally want to garden and what level
of organics you want to be on,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that's where you want to take
things with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might not want to use all of the
phosphate products or you might not want
[SPEAKER_05]: to use all of the animal based products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely kind of a good
guideline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing with growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Bonham might've played it and you can
play it and give it your own flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, put open high hats somewhere and
do your thing with it because your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are in a different room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can mix up the same exact newts and
feed all of our plants to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of our plants are going to be
pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having girlfriends, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is not going to like the same
thing as the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not even get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say that we, you know, the TLO is a
good place to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then while you're reading through that
or before you read through that,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend everybody should just,
it sounds stupid, but just make yourself
[SPEAKER_05]: read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody should read some sort of Horace
or Vonte or Ed Rose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody should read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't read Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marijuana Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Oxtradame Course Guide.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Marijuana Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend reading that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cut corners in your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you might have to in the
beginning, but as you go, something to do
[SPEAKER_02]: is definitely upgrade your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dial it in, have an environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the organics, the one thing that
you're trying to do is mimic nature to
[SPEAKER_02]: your fullest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when growing in a pot and using a
chelated nutrient in a bottle,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nothing living going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by bringing those microbes into your
pot, you're doing so much to your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going back to what it
should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might take it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some strains might freak out depending on
where you get it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to do organics and you
like to start from seed, definitely start
[SPEAKER_02]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some good quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't skimp on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuts are good, but definitely a good way
to grow is start some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump in and even if it's bag seed,
it's- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't oppose growing a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got a bag seed and it turns out to
be a reg seed, pollen happens and it might
[SPEAKER_02]: be beneficial for you to let it happen the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a whole other subject as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as they're not all female.
[SPEAKER_02]: More books, more books.
[SPEAKER_02]: More what you've got on track.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd read T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_05]: would be one of the first ones,
Marijuana Horticulture, Ed Rosenthal,
[SPEAKER_05]: some sort of basic book.
[SPEAKER_05]: His books are amazing just because they
touch on so many different bases.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great gateway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you read books like that,
if you're not familiar with academia and
[SPEAKER_05]: going to school and things like that,
it really helps recharge you and teach you
[SPEAKER_05]: how to research and teach how to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where I really recommend
reading books.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the Rev, I think,
pinpoints his book is getting hands on to
[SPEAKER_02]: people that aren't necessarily,
like Sean said, book smart or can sit in a
[SPEAKER_02]: classroom and learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rev will tell a joke in the middle of
a paragraph.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll totally off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you think like, oh man, I hate
reading, or if you're not like that type
[SPEAKER_05]: of guy, just try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I promise, and it's different when you
want to learn something.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so I would go with those books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are great bases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you want to start getting a
little bit more advanced, obviously,
[SPEAKER_05]: most people are familiar, have heard of
Teaming with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one, it's a little complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one I read over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a quick reference book.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll use the Rev's book a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll see when you, as a beginner and
you're mixing soils and you're making
[SPEAKER_05]: teas, you're going to have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to end up buying six copies
of it because you're going to have it next
[SPEAKER_05]: to your brewer and you're going to leave
it on the engine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know how to do something,
he starts you off and he lets you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that you might mess up, but like you said,
smell your teas or you're going to smell
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Teaming with Microbes book will eventually
become like that for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you get to the next level,
you're going to start getting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once you've covered your basis and
you're a little bit more familiar with the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil food web and how things work as far
as nutrient cycling, and you get a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit more familiar with compost tea inputs,
why you're using them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're really like, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using my, even if you're using your
bottled organic nutrient, you got your
[SPEAKER_05]: earthworm castings in your mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing your weekly teas and you're
rolling and you're like, man, this is
[SPEAKER_05]: cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already read these books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you live in a state to where
you don't really, you know, not
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's open about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then where I would turn is like where we
were kind of talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there's a lot of PDF files about
Korean natural farming, different things
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, natural farming inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I would recommend going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you kind of get comfortable with your
basis and that'll tell you how you can
[SPEAKER_05]: actually make your own inoculates,
how you can make your own fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where save all your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The unconventional farmer shows that,
but the Rev getting back to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: since this is like a beginning into
organics, he shows you different ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might suit your growth style.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to necessarily do teas,
but just want to use waters, he talks
[SPEAKER_02]: about like nutrient spikes that you can
put in your soil that are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I first got into organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I couldn't have some plants
inside, so I needed to put them outdoors
[SPEAKER_02]: and not have to check on them that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, why not try it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it worked out pretty, pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, uh, don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you can really mess things up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I think actually said on like
what maybe the first show about how I
[SPEAKER_05]: actually ran a lot of the Rev stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, you got to learn some animal
proteins and you can really overdo a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get super hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to decompose over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to give them their moment to
shine in your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't have the revs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't try the revs mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I would do is, uh, if you really want
to start mixing urine soil and like you
[SPEAKER_05]: really, you're just fucking just
determined on it and you're going to the
[SPEAKER_05]: hydra store and you're going to pick up
some amendments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, if you're going to go with the
back soil, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go sunshine four, you go pro mix,
you can go happy frog.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just pick what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally would recommend you go on
with the sterile medium, something with
[SPEAKER_05]: not no real nutrient pack to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start from a laboratory standpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend like a pro mix or a base
sunshine mix or even a sunshine advanced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I think those options are really
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't even want to buy your own
back soil, then just go and pick up a
[SPEAKER_05]: brick of peat moss from Lowe's,
go and get you a bag of perlite from,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the hydro store or the farming
store, the garden supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just watch out because you know,
sometimes when you source that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: things can come in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you might want to treat it
naturally before you start using it or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, keep an eye on it because,
uh, pests are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little microbes are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fungus and you know, you don't want to
bring in how much are my worm castings
[SPEAKER_02]: going to help me keep a way those pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's going to build up just
everything in the soil around your
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to start,
um, fighting the fight before your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: even growing, you know, so it's like,
uh, I don't know, like an antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I mean, you're going to,
it's going to help build your plants
[SPEAKER_05]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, it'll start fighting it
from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of goes back down into building
a shield and chitin, eating bacteria and
[SPEAKER_05]: how that's cycled through the plant,
which I'd love to come to, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: get some classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to get to talking about like
the different aspects, like what is in our
[SPEAKER_05]: castings and why they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have you guys back soon because I
want to do an episode about like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, we can't have everybody because we're
not telling you throw away the bottle of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what anyone's saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to find a balance for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be one of our next topic is
the, find the balance between the bottles
[SPEAKER_01]: and the organics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, yeah, just don't,
yeah, don't toss your bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't throw anything away slowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some worm castings, start making teas
and then slowly start working things out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a, you're not just going to
magically become an organic gardener.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dip your foot in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be the way to way improve your
growing though.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could make your buds taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell it in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just sweeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of growers who, uh,
will actually go to make the transition
[SPEAKER_05]: and then find their nice little happy spot
in the middle and nothing's wrong with
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if that's what you want as a
grower, I know a lot of people who are
[SPEAKER_05]: really happy and just kill it growing
synthetics and organics together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, like you said, it can really
improve your growing style and whether you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to commit to going fully organic or
you want to run synthetics, I think that
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody could benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the flour that we're actually
smoking tonight, uh, was grown by a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend, uh, that works at the grow
warehouse in Colorado Springs who uses
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky mountain worm castings, but he
integrates it with nectar of the gods,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he uses nectar of the gods and a very
low dosage with, uh, teas and he uses
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he does practice a, um, you know,
an organic, um, style of growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not full organic permaculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that bottle kick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that little boost that it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, the training wheels,
but he's, you know, he is actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, an arborist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so one of the things that we want to
try to be able to prove present through
[SPEAKER_05]: Jay is, uh, if it holds any merit to
anybody out there, we're going to call it
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocky mountain natural farming certified.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we'll do is, uh, we're going to
try to start looking into some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: products for you and we will R and D
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give it our stamp of approval.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is no armory listing for us,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no, there's, I mean, there is an
armory listing on certain, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: bottled nutrients and stuff, but we have
nothing to really go off of.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to create some sort of system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we're really hoping to do
know where you source from is take the
[SPEAKER_05]: time for you to look into where your
products come from, how they're made,
[SPEAKER_05]: how they affect the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if I'm in your store, I can buy
that and know that I didn't just buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you who plants, where it came
from, you know, I'll tell you how it was
[SPEAKER_05]: harvested when it was harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to have to hire more
people open your doors more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, after a couple of episodes,
you're going to get people knocking on
[SPEAKER_01]: your door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the meantime, as we get things
working, like I said, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: please contact us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, we're working really hard
to, you know, make orders and keep
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys ship?
[SPEAKER_05]: We do ship nationwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nationwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have homies all over the place that use
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the, uh, the website?
[SPEAKER_02]: RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can get in touch with any one of
us, um, through Instagram or our emails
[SPEAKER_02]: that we will leave with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would highly recommend if you want
something out of the state of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, I would recommend going online and
then just sourcing it straight through
[SPEAKER_05]: RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, as far as local growers, I cannot
stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in Colorado, stop by the store.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us, uh, I talked to Jay a little
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to work something out,
but tell us that you listened to the show
[SPEAKER_05]: and that you heard about it and we'll give
you a quarter pound to cover crop for free
[SPEAKER_05]: just for mentioning that, you know,
we'll figure something out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're nifty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to repeat what he said, I want to,
cause the listeners were high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you mentioned, if you shop at the
worm store and you say that you listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast, they'll give you a quarter
pound of cover crop to start off your
[SPEAKER_01]: organics or say help out your organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll keep everything moist so that your
worms don't or your worm castings don't
[SPEAKER_01]: dry out so that your micro fungi go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not die on you while it's growing
in there when things dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think I let mine get a little too
dry lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to use the natural enzymes of
plants that are around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one big thing with organics is,
uh, with sourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to do like six
episodes with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to hear guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: For the month of March, uh, like I said,
we're hoping to have some big things
[SPEAKER_05]: planned for April.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're hoping to have, we want to have a
meet and greet this month.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know who everybody's out there
planning to have a one or two classes in
[SPEAKER_05]: March, all leading up to the cup with our
business stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, for the month of March,
we're going to try to offer, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: what I would call free consultation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, we want to help you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You replace your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to direct message me,
Nick, Alan, Jay, email us or Jeff and get
[SPEAKER_05]: in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we want to do is we want to know
what you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to, you know, we want to
help you out with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: For this bottle, you could try this,
throw away this bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if, for example, even if you're,
you know, if you're in a Nebraska or
[SPEAKER_05]: you're in Canada or you're in England,
uh, if you're growing in a computer or a
[SPEAKER_05]: basement, we can direct you in the right
direction or I was going to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: or even we can, uh, we can give you your
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we can't, if it doesn't seem
logical, you know, it's, uh, it's that jet
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan's the joint monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from, you know, over there,
the East coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was saying, I usually smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was respectful in this situation
because I didn't know if you smoke the
[SPEAKER_02]: blunts, but, uh, I am a blunt master.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean, I know is as well from the East
coast with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not afraid.
[SPEAKER_05]: The blunts as well as Spencer probably
smoke way more blunts than you would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, I brought the Dutchies,
but he showed up with the Dutchie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought the Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just didn't, uh, roll on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we have to roll on for a
farewell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of us hate our lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love quality cannabis, but I love the
Dutch masters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take one or two off it just to be,
uh, just to celebrate with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, we can just not an everyday smoke
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still lit off the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes my head weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a, it's a tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I came out here and
everybody smokes joints, but when I came
[SPEAKER_02]: out here, I couldn't find the Dutchies
until one day I went to a little
[SPEAKER_02]: convenience store that had the Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to that little convenience
store in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a backflip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take all these Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A homie told me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came into a session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, man, you just made my heart
melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were fresh and it was a great
night that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to them for always keeping
the fresh Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So meet and greets coming up in March.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to interrupt you, but do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're up in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Nick and I just kind of, we did a
little side, uh, side meeting real quick
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, we might be having maybe like a
barbecue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we can do some organic,
um, you know, demonstrations there and get
[SPEAKER_02]: some little meet and greet sesh,
you know, get hands on, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just, uh, come up and we want to know the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start a community and keep
Colorado organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, we'll, uh, we'll keep in
touch with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to try to set a date for a
nice little formal meet and greet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to come by for a whole
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to drop by and say,
Hey, Friday night, this is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll record you saying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there are phones, we can text and
things like that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just send a carrier pigeon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put your text on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, if you just, we'll get it to you
to get out there and, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll just put a date out, but we're going
to have a meet and greet this month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, next month we plan to have one or two
classes leading up to the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to try to help
everybody out as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I was saying before, if you want
to change the way you grow, email us,
[SPEAKER_05]: email Jeff, email Nick, email Alan,
email Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, tell us what you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us, you know, if you've ever done
organics, give us a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: background about yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you do things?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, are you familiar with organics
and let us help you, let us help change
[SPEAKER_05]: the way you grow or at least change the
way you source things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really want to shine some light on what
you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want you to understand that's like,
you know, okay, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a better option.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everything that's in a bottle is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some companies do care what their patients
are putting into their plants and into
[SPEAKER_02]: their medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some good companies,
like I said, nectar of the gods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're buying a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, yeah, when you go to the hydro
store and you're asking somebody a
[SPEAKER_02]: question, go to the bottle and read
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of companies put a face on their
brand and that's marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not what organics is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics is actually like having the
product and it does what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of bottles put things on their
labels to make you go towards the bottle
[SPEAKER_02]: that exactly the same thing as another
nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a little cheaper and it's
just, you know, it's the same value.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why some companies change their
label every three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big inside secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what that 98% inert ingredient
is?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what that water and you got to
pay for that to be shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody had to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to drive it across the country,
put it in a plastic bottle, throw the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids in Africa need it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people could use that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, get some water coming out of
your faucet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just make your own nutrients with the
water coming out of your faucet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for a little bit over an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should start wrapping it up because the
listeners get high as like we do and they
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
So we're going to wrap it up and then
we're going to wrap it up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice little intro to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is number one of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be six or seven of these
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so what you guys want to know,
let us know and hit us up and don't be
[SPEAKER_02]: afraid to, let's discuss some things and
let's talk organics and what really needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to be done and not spending too much on
what needs to be done and just getting it
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really save some money and have a
beautiful quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why wouldn't you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So let us know and we'll see you soon at
some type of demonstration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbecue, sesh something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep you guys posted when those are
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just let us know and, you know,
thank you for having us, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your Instagram one more time?
[SPEAKER_02]: The BigToker Underscore.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, follow him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some good pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I check him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep it real for you guys and
it's my, it's the lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that reached out to me and
got him on the, and got this group on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Sean's been here, but Jay was
supposed to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Jay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're going to get Jay on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear how much fun this is,
right, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy another car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out with us, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, Jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke a dab, chill out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jay does not medicate like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he will probably be floating on the
ceiling just from the aroma around us from
[SPEAKER_02]: the second hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have to use the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might have to put him in another
room or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I gave Jesse a dab, a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave Jesse a dab and he ended up on that
couch for about two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some of those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any shout outs or plugs or anything over
there, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear Sky Creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Clear Sky Creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure to say the name of the wonderful
artist that made this beautiful wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: His wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's my wife, Elise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Elise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put her on a shorter chain so
that it doesn't cover up my ivory logo and
[SPEAKER_01]: end up in all my food because at the
length it is, it'll end up in my food,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to shorten it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use the same necklace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to make it a little
shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll rock it every day, every other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably trade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think mine's shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, I'm down if you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks just about the right length.
[SPEAKER_04]: My food bowl goes right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: She makes them all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just go have her shorten that one for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Final word, go buy some worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use your worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do worms, son.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to get worms from us,
use the tag, what are you worming with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to coin that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag, what are you worming with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to let us use your,
like you said, we're a community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, one random question to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm adding OGT into my mix with my worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wasting money now, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: OGT is a soft rock phosphate trichoderma
hyzarium, which has actually been taken
[SPEAKER_05]: out of like Great White, a couple of their
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: They cycle nutrients too quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're familiar with OG
BioWAR, but it's the same reason they
[SPEAKER_05]: recommend not using the new pack with a
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll actually cycle nutrients out of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Worm castings, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't even need the molasses every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just answered a question I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few plants that are showing some
deficiencies and they're fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because I put so much OGT in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just take it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I don't feed too much of a
certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it can lock out other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you never would think that OGT would
cause you a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't assume so.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's one of the good,
I guess that's one of the good things
[SPEAKER_05]: about OGT is a little bit goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use it very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a third of a cup to 25 gallons
of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They try to give your plant that boost,
you know, that you don't get with the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic sometimes because the plants,
you know, still be coming itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, bottom line with using Rocky
Mountain worm castings, no, you don't need
[SPEAKER_05]: to use OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear that guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a hater of OGT, but these worm
castings are ridiculously cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you want to put soft rock
phosphate or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: in there, we also sell that at the shop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can make your own instead of
buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you a little, you know,
a bump in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have already given me 20 new
ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got like seven products written down
that I need to go pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple new tricks I want to try.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get your shout outs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said thanks to your wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's high at this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a long episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to read the part that I read
at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thanks for listening to another
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't forget to check out our
sponsors, naturesgreenremedies.com and
[SPEAKER_01]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we hyped them up a little
bit on the show, the Rocky Mountain Worm
[SPEAKER_01]: Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out all my friends that came and
joined us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came and joined us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a proper sentence.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow them all on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the show's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the iTunes store or the Stitcher
main page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Search for Hygro Culture, or no,
search for Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I printed the wrong paper again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just say that I was so upset about
that and that is just something that they
[SPEAKER_02]: should, I don't know, whatever Apple had
to say, but hey, you should get in touch
[SPEAKER_02]: with us because this is something that you
should have on your station.
[SPEAKER_01]: So- There's actually some, it's an
educational agricultural entity that does
[SPEAKER_01]: courses and shit, and they didn't want
cannabis associated with their school
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they're like, you got to change that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to use cannabis,
we can go with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hit us up and let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll totally get on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Grow From Your Heart fits
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do like it rings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to grow from our heart in this
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not growing from our wallets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're growing from our heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'll correct myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never say Hygro Culture again is Grow
From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that review section in there and
iTunes and Stitcher, give me a five-star
[SPEAKER_01]: rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give me as many as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens is the more ratings I
get, the more they move me up,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more I'm advertised in the show,
the more people see us, the more people
[SPEAKER_01]: get to grow better cannabis, the more
people quit using MAP and DAP,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more people use worm castings,
the more people have better weed and the
[SPEAKER_01]: more patients feel better and then your
eyes are redder and things are better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes in circles like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think the show is awesome,
tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think the show sucks, tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to improve what you say,
but I'll probably just ignore you and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what I'm doing because I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stitcher keeps changing the way the
comments are handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, leave a comment wherever you can find
the spot to do it and I'll read your
[SPEAKER_01]: comment on the show.

anymore because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the old word that we're not going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super huge shout out to my Ninja Spitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 53,
54 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: your source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, a professional
grower, if you're a new smoker,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even if you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who's curious about the current
state of cannabis, this, my friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll up a fat joint, grab a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are joined today by King Kola once
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: His real name is Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call him King Kola.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call him Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll alternate between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got an alter ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like a superhero and shit over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the organic as fuck superhero.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ross Kola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting across the table from me is our
good buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, dude, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to let Jesse talk a lot on
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, you have a lot of good shit to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You showed up with the sheets,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jesse brought notes and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: On time and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to give a big shout out
to the Mystic Roots man for letting me
[SPEAKER_01]: play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, huge thanks to Kat and Coot and the
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do an ad, but Sean just said
something that really got my attention
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that NPK value no longer matters
to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to elaborate that now that
I've got some microphones turned on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think NPK with organic, true organic
gardening isn't a necessity.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that is, NPK value is all
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was invented for synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a way to sell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just giving the plant what they
need, when they need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason I brought this up to you is
actually saw a post earlier today and it
[SPEAKER_05]: was out of a publication.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just read it for you real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give credit to who it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is Plant and Prosper.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't follow him on Instagram,
it's plant underscore in underscore
[SPEAKER_05]: Prosper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw him throw this up earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Justin von Leibig.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually credited with creating
synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a little excerpt that Plant
Prosper posted from a book that he was
[SPEAKER_05]: reading.
[SPEAKER_05]: NPK gardeners own their practices to the
great scientist, Justin von Leibig,
[SPEAKER_05]: the father of artificial fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_05]: What most don't know is that later in
life, von Leibig acknowledged a grave
[SPEAKER_05]: mistake in relying only on chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, he saw negative impacts of
artificial fertilizers on life in the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: in his own vegetable garden and thereafter
preferred organic matter to inorganic
[SPEAKER_05]: chemical fertilizer he invented.
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote von Leibig, after I learned the
reason why my fertilizers weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: effective in the proper way, I was like a
person that received a new life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understanding how nutrients will make us
all see the light and then ultimately make
[SPEAKER_05]: us better gardeners with more sustainable
gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, kind of butchered that at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, that's pretty much been your
message the whole time anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the synthetics are disrupting the
eco-life, the organic life in the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we need to get away from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And have I said on the show that you
brought me a Bokashi bucket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I said that yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, last show I mentioned I was going to
bring it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got to give you a big thanks for
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks and shout out to the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean brought me a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm one step closer to becoming organic
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ordered one last week too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll Bokashi together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be Bokashi buddies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bokashi bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say that out loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a little weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the growers are like, sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else is like, what the hell are
those guys doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to Bokashi with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go to the Bokashi class.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the purple Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Kalanji club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's turned in purple too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a lot of pictures today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Kalanji Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a sweet strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were you saying about the NPK?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, basically NPK was created with
synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of the basis behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You give plant nitrogen when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You give the plant phosphorus and
potassium when they need it or when you
[SPEAKER_05]: think they need it and you bypass this
natural process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by doing that, when you bypass this
process, basically you're just leaving the
[SPEAKER_05]: salts, the mineral salts and everything
that's left over from the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not immediately taken up by the
plant's roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're leaving that in the dirt because
you've bypassed all natural chemicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically if I just drank Gatorade
all day or something salty all day,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say Gatorade because they'll sue
the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I just put salt water all day,
that's essentially what we're feeding the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants by feeding them synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll pee out the water, but the salts
stay in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's going to say, but I flush
heavily, but you don't flush often enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you get run off, that salt is
still binding to your... Because your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has to metabolize it and what it
does metabolize is still coming out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the extra buildup you put in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the part that was never used and
then you got the part that was
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a lot of salt stuck in there using
the synthetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and then it also forms the plant
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's in the plant materials as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to smoke those salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you rolling up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're a couple feet away from me
and that shit smells delicious over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear it's getting stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I brought the WiFi Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The WiFi Tahoe smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you grow that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I picked it up from a local shop up in
the Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to that local shop in the
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the NPK, we don't rely on the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We rely on more of what it's called the
nutritive cycle theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like a person.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant's a baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs things to aid in its vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where your nitrogen comes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where your potassium comes in to
help strengthen those cell walls as your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants get bigger to make sure that
everything's going properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of giving the plant directly what
it needs, what we'll do is we'll let the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant decide for itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those things will be available in
the soil and not in the sense that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to load it down with alfalfa meal or
bone meal or blood meal, but the soil will
[SPEAKER_05]: have an NPK value.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, you know, I had calculated last
time and just with the real basic mix of
[SPEAKER_05]: like neem and carrage and kelp meal and
things like that, I think we were running
[SPEAKER_05]: around like a three to four is kind of
what the fertilizer quote unquote was
[SPEAKER_05]: coming out at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fairly low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that plant got everything it
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where we come from is,
you know, that's the reason that when you
[SPEAKER_05]: go to the grow store, you'll see that
organic fertilizers are like zero or,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, 1.23 or these extremely low
numbers and people see that and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: like, oh, that's, the other one says zero,
zero 60.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's going to yield me way more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a common misconception.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, I mean, you will get bigger buds
using that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be the tastiest or
the cleanest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I ate a bunch of pennies, I would feel
full, but I just shoot out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: pennies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't get anything from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll argue that you're not necessarily
going to get bigger buds from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the like, you know, zero,
zero 60, that sounds like a powdered blue
[SPEAKER_07]: booster.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those things can really fuck your plan
up in a hurry if you try to go too crazy
[SPEAKER_07]: with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, as far as the whole NPK
thing, I wouldn't stress it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd make sure that when you, you go into
your cycle, make sure your soil's amended
[SPEAKER_05]: properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's, you know, make sure that
you're feeding it beneficial bacteria,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's getting everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: If, you know, it'll have alfalfa in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll have kelp in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need that booster, you can always
top dress with like a fish bone meal or
[SPEAKER_05]: make a nettle tea or a yarrow tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many different options.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those, while they may not be high in
NPK, that's what they're predominant with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to, you know,
that's going to get the, you enter that
[SPEAKER_05]: into the soil, that's going to get the
bacteria and the fungi cycling,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever nutrient you just ingested,
you know, you entered into the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just going to keep carrying on
that process and keep delivering it to
[SPEAKER_05]: your plant as your plant needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your plant know when to stop eating
at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like, oh, so you can't,
you're not, you don't run as much risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: burning it with the organics is something
I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when I was, when I really kind of
first got into it, I kept getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen deficiencies at the beginning of
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like every ran I did organic,
it would just, for some reason,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just get these yellow ass leaves,
you know, week three and it just,
[SPEAKER_05]: it sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to follow your feed to keep up and
do everything you can to chase it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in week three, if you're already
yellow and it's, yeah, it's a lost race.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought that it was because,
yeah, I wasn't feeding the plant enough
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't necessarily the case where I
really saw the improvement was when I
[SPEAKER_05]: dialed my amendments back, you know,
when I really slowed things down and was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, okay, I'm not going to pound it with
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make sure that the soil food
webs alive, that everything's cycling,
[SPEAKER_05]: how it needs to, that everything is
working and we'll let the plant decide for
[SPEAKER_05]: itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I mean, I haven't, I haven't
seen, you know, any more, I haven't dealt
[SPEAKER_05]: with the deficiency in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that I don't, I haven't ran
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't run, when I, I don't run
traditional growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't say that this is what I'm,
you know, you're going to yield compared
[SPEAKER_05]: to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just ran, I just made the switch back to
full organics and my indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had been using bottled nutrients and my,
my first, I took the clones, my first set
[SPEAKER_07]: of plants that we transplanted into a good
soil and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we never fed them any bottled
nutrients or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there wasn't any, uh, flushing
involved, but I use the soil mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty much what I'd been using
previously.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, when I grew indoors and I nitrogen
burned some of them, I think, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: the first half of the plants I
transplanted, um, used one amount of,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, all the inputs and I got yellowing
instantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, a lot of people could have
been like, Oh, that's lack of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I already knew there was a shit ton of
nitrogen in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next night when we transplanted the
other half of the plants, I, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: just cut the, the mountain half and use
the half amount of everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those plants just exploded instantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and they're still outgrowing,
you know, that's been three weeks ago and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're still outgrowing, uh, the plants
that we transplanted the first night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go easy with the organics because
they're bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are, that's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants can eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, yeah, they don't have
to do as much work to eat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can speed them up too much by
overfeeding them with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something we're talking about
with one of our favorite products is OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sean was teaching me how OGT can kind
of speed up the metabolism of your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go easy on the OGT guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been recommending that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, replace that with Rocky Mountain worm
castings if you're able to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering, uh, when I heard,
I listened to the podcast last night,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, but, uh, I was wondering if that could
be useful in flushing in any way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It absolutely could.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a lot of good sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're a super huge fan of OG
BioWare.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started using them here recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so impressed with OG BioWare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm talking just from the
standpoint of the plants overall health.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I haven't seen a damn yellow leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't, everything's green and waxy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, but the, that goes to the new
pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had read somewhere that somebody had
actually mentioned hitting it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you're only supposed to use the
nutrient pack, I believe three times
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout the whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I heard them about introducing it a
fourth time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, about like, or not even into flush.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they were saying like around like
week, you know, a couple of weeks before
[SPEAKER_05]: flush actually like really start cycling
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, that's definitely
something worth looking into.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to have to start taking
a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: On these next few episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have Sean back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean wants to do a full episode on
recycling soil and reamending your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a listener ask specifically about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks fast Barry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who you are, but you fall,
you're an awesome person.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate you listening and
your input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want to let Jesse talk a little
bit or a lot actually about, he wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain is blank today.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to talk about light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting a head start on the outdoor
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean's got a bomb he wants to drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to drop it now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want to put people in suspense
and give this new idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we'll bring it out on the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the next time that Sean comes over,
he's going to talk about reamending
[SPEAKER_01]: recycled soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's got a bomb to drop on the
entire growing world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to either, you're going to
hate me or you're going to love me,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we're going to change the way you
think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a certain item that most
people are using regularly in their
[SPEAKER_05]: lineup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that I know is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's using regularly in their
lineup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use it regularly in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't think that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just learned this too, so I'm guilty of
it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably give you two weeks to study
up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably skip you on one episode
just because we don't want you too many
[SPEAKER_01]: times so you don't get stale and expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll, you can just ash run on
the table bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, perfect tip though anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too lazy to get up and get an ashtray.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we'll have you back and we'll let
you drop that bomb on the show and disrupt
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's growing methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to do a couple of commercials
because I did not do them and we're about
[SPEAKER_01]: to let Jesse talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first ad, first ad is from
naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit naturesgreenremedies.com for gauge
green genetics, La Plata Labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sin City, Rare Dankness, Mile High,
CannaVenture, the Cali Connection,
[SPEAKER_01]: MTG, iRegenetics, and many, many more
trusted brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the coupon code is for
this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to update you in the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a coupon code.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to interrupt you for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember what it was, but it was
25% off and that's a hell of a fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can find that coupon code.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone on Instagram was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out
naturesgreenremedies on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like green remedies nature or
naturesgreen or something because
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is kind of a bitch and they've
been killing people's pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Yankee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a coupon code for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to figure out the date that this
show posts because if this goes out after
[SPEAKER_01]: February, which I think it does,
then I need a new coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to post one up at the end of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make a note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Code is what I'm writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since Jesse's here, this podcast is also
brought to you by our good friends at

[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Maddie will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Jesse will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what's up to my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out highgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll be there lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out highgrow for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highgrow runs a special for the podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you have to do is tell them that you
listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will give you commercial pricing.

[SPEAKER_01]: Under an entire order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your whole order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get commercial pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That saves you a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely saves you some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're buying a big bag of soil,
it definitely chops down the price.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used it today myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Saved myself four and a half bucks on a
bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four and a half bucks counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it cheaper than everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That coupon code is actually better than
the employee discount I'm supposed to give
[SPEAKER_07]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, big shout out to Rocky Mountain Worm
Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to move to organics,
more sustainable gardening, a better way
[SPEAKER_01]: of growing, a healthier, safer way of
farming, a way that will last forever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be able to eliminate those plastic
bottles, eliminate a lot of water
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping, a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions about that,
check out it's at King Cola on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you spell it actually?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at K-I-N-G underscore C-O-L-A.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew there was an underscore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an underscore between the words
and at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big shout out to the Rocky Mountain Worm
Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're now an official sponsor for the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will write them a really super ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not sure how to advertise that
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the ads sound the same to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're great guys, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get them back on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, we're going to have the
guys from... I shouldn't even tease you
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dragonfly Earth Medicine people are
going to be on the show pretty soon also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt, Grammy Gatsby, I hope you're
listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for you to come be on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody send the Grammy Gatsby an email
and tell them that they need to be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of love to all the sponsors for
making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does help out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to sponsor the show,
just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all the information that you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, don't forget that there is a
donation button on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the iregeneticscolorado.com website,
click on the podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top right, there is a donation

[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like donating a few dollars
for the time that I spent putting this
[SPEAKER_01]: show together, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not begging you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want you to know that it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that, do that, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's time to let Jesse talk
about light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot of notes over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to just let you go about
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want me to ask you a couple of
questions I had written down?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think it's cool?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a good starting point?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then get started, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here comes Jesse.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually don't have as many notes as it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't even read most of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just... It's really big print.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is pretty big.
[SPEAKER_07]: This top paragraph or three is the
important part.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was written by either Eric or
Jonathan from Forever Flowering
[SPEAKER_07]: Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to shout them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're great guys, great products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I found it on a website called the
ganjier.com, which is also a great
[SPEAKER_07]: website.
[SPEAKER_07]: Joint break.
[SPEAKER_07]: So light deprivation, this is just a
definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we taste good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can taste the Tahoe in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was having trouble and I've always had
trouble explaining light depth to some
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will use someone else's definition of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Light deprivation, AKA light depth,
is the process of forcing plants to flower
[SPEAKER_07]: with sunlight in a time of year that is
not normally the flowering period of the
[SPEAKER_07]: sun's natural light cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Similar to controlling the light cycle
with the grow light by turning it on and
[SPEAKER_07]: off with a timer, farmers can control the
budding cycle by blocking the sunlight and
[SPEAKER_07]: making the plants think it's time to
flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Typically, this is done with the hoop
house or greenhouse of some kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it's not actually necessary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I lost my track.
All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll recap a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll recap a little while you catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what we're trying to do,
we want to grow outside, but we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a little bit of a jump on the outdoor
season before the police and thieves go
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for the outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our trick is to build a greenhouse
outside or a hoop house, which I'll let
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse explain how to build a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our construction guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a beard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what we need to do,
we want to put our plants outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And outside, we'll put them out early
before we get to our flowering cycle that
[SPEAKER_01]: nature gives us with the sun, the sun
cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The photo period is what makes these
plants flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are going to trick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to cover up our outdoor
greenhouse or hoop house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to cover that up every day at
the same time and let them sleep for 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hours and then uncover it every morning at
the same time so that these plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: tricked into thinking that the season has
changed to fall and it's time for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we can do this with the... If you
schedule it right, you can get these going
[SPEAKER_01]: four weeks, maybe three or four weeks
before everybody else is in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull off one crop before everybody
else and that shit won't get stolen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you can... Shit, I have it all
figured out because I'm doing it myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you put your plants out April 25th
here, you will harvest July 30th,
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody gets a harvest till late
September, early October, mid October.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's with the 65 day strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not going to worry about any
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get that freeze that
everybody worries about.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in our region, possibly a little bit
in the early season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put plants back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And re-flower them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually... You can get two runs
out of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two runs easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen three runs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually I've seen four runs,
but that was with a forever flowering
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forever flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a hoop house or a small greenhouse is
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are trying to do this on a
small level, the smallest level of light
[SPEAKER_01]: deprivation I think you could do,
put a couple of potted plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to use a seven gallon or bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, some people, you know,
this is for the guy that's just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do one plant for himself or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your seven gallon... A lot of guys are
going to use a five gallon bucket from
[SPEAKER_01]: Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what they're going to go
get.
[SPEAKER_07]: 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up 44?
[SPEAKER_01]: So 44, you take your... And 44 was kind of
doing this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take your five gallon Home Depot
bucket with your big ass plant in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and every day at six o'clock or every day
at seven o'clock, whatever time you
[SPEAKER_01]: choose, you got to pay attention to what
time the sun goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that plant and go put it in a closet
in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just put it back in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in your grow room or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a small operation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put it in the room for the night and
let it sleep every night at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has to go back outside under
the sun every night or every day at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you give that plant 12 hours of
consistent, 12 hours of darkness
[SPEAKER_01]: uninterrupted every night, you can do a
light depth like that and use the sun and
[SPEAKER_01]: a closet for your grow area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the trick too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't actually have to put it back out
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have to wait for, you know,
10, 11 o'clock at night, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: safe time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sun completely down, no lumens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then use your farmer's almanac to find
out what time the sun goes up that
[SPEAKER_04]: morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And typically you're probably getting your
first actual, this is from Jonathan of
[SPEAKER_07]: Forever Flowering actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not this smart, but you get your first
lumens probably before the sun actually
[SPEAKER_07]: comes up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, take 20 minutes off that
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's, I've done it before the
old fashion or the other way of,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, seven and seven and it's very
tedious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take it back outside guys,
bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the sun's going to set at eight o
'clock, bring that plant in at seven o
[SPEAKER_01]: 'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it chill out before you go to bed at
11 or 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go put it back outside because it's
nighttime or you got to find out what time
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun's going to come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to be six,
37 o'clock in the summer, probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to buy a, pot a big ass pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to buy some soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to buy some Rocky Mountain worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to buy some Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need some Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of cool other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Azomite a little bit makes that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean's going to teach you what to put in
your soil in a couple of, so it's put all
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit in a pot, put a nice clone of
some grateful dog in there, throw that
[SPEAKER_01]: sucker outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's free weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you could use a garage,
a shed, you know, anything, if it's just a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people take a big ass trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a little plant, you take a
little big 30 something gallon trash can,
[SPEAKER_01]: drill some holes in the bottom of it so
that you got airflow and then just set
[SPEAKER_01]: that bitch right on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them do that for hail storms,
but also seen them do that for a shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it'd work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be, you know,
it's not going to be the most amazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do you want to teach these guys how to
do a hoop house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like a quick, since you're the man
with the hammer and all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real simple one is just, you need a gravel
pad or an elevated area.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you don't need it, but you need
drainage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It keeps it from being a muddy mess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus, I'm stoned again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made the mistake of not smoking all day
before coming at Jeff's.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you show up at my spot, it's dab time
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a pregame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to warm up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, take two by fours,
lay them down on the ground, screw them to
[SPEAKER_07]: each other, make a big rectangle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight foot by let's say 12 foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you need two eight foot two by fours,
two 12 foot two by fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a rectangle pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Handful of screws.
[SPEAKER_07]: Build that, stake it to the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of different ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: A piece of rebar or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then nail the rebar to the two by four
with a fence staple or something like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then take you, let's see, eight or 12
foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing construction math.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say at least six pieces of at least
two inch PVC would need to be at least 12
[SPEAKER_07]: or 14 foot long, I think, to make the
entire hoop over.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the front you'll screw,
basically you're just going to bend the
[SPEAKER_07]: PVC into a hoop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Into a half circle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you're making kind of a, it just looks
like a really cheap greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'll use some clamps,
like some conduit clamps.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can even just screw straight through
the PVC into the, but I mean, you got to
[SPEAKER_07]: secure it to the two by four somehow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for a 12 foot greenhouse, I'd put up
four of those pieces of PVC or four hoops
[SPEAKER_07]: and then use one as a skeleton beam down
the middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be at the peak.
[SPEAKER_07]: Attach it with zip ties or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in a really windy area,
you'll probably want to beef up your
[SPEAKER_07]: material a little.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the front range of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, just throw some
plastic over it and boom, you've got a
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some thin see-through plastic right over
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got a weatherproof,
weather-resistant greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, you basically built this big
rectangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've secured the rectangle to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we took PVC and made arches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just made one, two,
three, four or so arches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got one at each end and then a couple
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you take that one right down the
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just drape plastic and secure
the plastic at each, on the bottom on each
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, do you let it hang and you make
some on the front back too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just leave the front back open?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're wanting to do it cheap,
I just really recommend leaving them open.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can get some air flow in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get some air flow in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get, unless it rains
totally sideways, you should be legit,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can have the plastic... Now
that greenhouse is good all year,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can use that for, if you don't
want to do light depth, that's a perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap little hoop house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a bunch of cannabis in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: An eight by 12, you can put a lot of pots
in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, get some seeds going or get some
clones cut now because you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get these suckers outside pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is real-time stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vegem inside, we haven't actually
addressed this, but Vegem inside to the
[SPEAKER_07]: size that you would normally flip a plant
or even fucking bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top them a few times, film them if you
can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our light depth plants are fucking
gigantic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're terpy.
[SPEAKER_07]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're as big as an outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it starts flowering outdoors,
an in-ground traditional or natural light
[SPEAKER_07]: cycle plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the yield is... I'm not going to
say numbers, but it's very much worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will definitely pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that outdoor cannabis is so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well-grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun does amazing things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Greenhouse cannabis has been protected
from the wind and rain, so it's a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: frostier.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks a little more like indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think greenhouse weed is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly prefer it to indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sun terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't match that in that controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got this hoop house and it's
pretty much weather resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eight by 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: How tall does it usually end up?
[SPEAKER_01]: About seven, eight feet tall is usually
about where we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I was thinking of in my head would
be about seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the one that... I've pretty
much been in one that you've built.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in two that were side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly what we're dealing with
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get some big ass... Your plants
can finish seven feet tall in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get gigantic with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen some guys in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have scissor lifts to pull the
plastic over and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the part we're going to have to
talk about now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make this light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put our plants out there
when they're waist high-ish, maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm tall, so I can't really judge by
that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're about 36 to 42 inches,
tall, you want to start inducing flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we can't just flip the light like
we used to indoors to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to do it like Jesse was
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to use some sort of cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to use some kind of tarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your greenhouse is 12 feet long and
eight feet wide, you're going to need 12
[SPEAKER_01]: by 12 at least to cover it because that
arch is going to take a lot more space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably 12 by 15 or so, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just get a 15 by 15 tarp just that you
have plenty of coverage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And make sure it's actually...
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually blocks out the sun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to use two layers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have used... I get green tarps because
of the green spectrum, supposedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's actually... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about the science behind
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just... I was standing there and I
was like, green tarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is to keep out all of the light
because you need it dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever time you pick every night,
if you pick seven o'clock, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what time the sun's going to
come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you pick seven o'clock,
you got to go out to this hoop house every
[SPEAKER_01]: night and cover it up with a tarp so it's
completely dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first few times you do it,
go in there and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for like 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lay down and hang out for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close your eyes and adjust to the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you can see any light,
if you can see any light in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make it darker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I continuously do that through the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's... With tarps and cheaper
material, I mean, forever flowering makes
[SPEAKER_07]: really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got some money to spend and some
land to put it on, check out Forever
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowering Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not your backyard setup though.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get just the greenhouse fabrics
from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're actually not too expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do it this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also have a blackout tarp that's
breathable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not too much just to order the
tarp from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can afford that, otherwise...
Tell them we sent you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want hats.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to close the deal for you,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: But damn, I lost my train of thought
thinking about their bitching hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Covering it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting dark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheap plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to tear throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, continuously check it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have extra plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put the tarp and then plastic over it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to make sure I get a total blackout.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't have any light in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our point, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every night, this is... The whole time
you're doing this, every night somebody,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully you, hopefully you've got the
dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's got to go out there every night
and make this shit dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every morning you have to go out
there and turn the lights on by uncovering
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get some air... You're
going to have to get airflow in there
[SPEAKER_01]: while it's covered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about a way to get airflow in
there while you're covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might need a fan towards the floor to
get some air in and out.
[SPEAKER_07]: A trick I use for that is this also helps
keep everything secure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sean's dedicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just pulled out forever flowers,
stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a business card.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Help you get in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I met them once, kind of.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a dab session?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was when they were through the greener
side one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No smoking allowed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: But... Shit, I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, was that like some sativa or
something in those dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually some lemon Jeffrey sour
diesel dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to warn me about that shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a sativa smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sitting here losing my shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was kind of wiggling around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so hard to sit still.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys would be proud of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I couldn't sleep last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dabbing this stuff, just going,
I'm trying to get tired and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabbing hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally an indica guy.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll remember that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the name of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse lost his train of thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, no, just I'll remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: Light def is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were just kind of talking about what
fabric and stuff you were going through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ventilation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take a booster fan, like a 10 inch or
12 inch one, and hook the ducting to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tie it to the side of the greenhouse so
it's up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't suck any dirt or anything into
the fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Set that on the floor of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plug it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pull your tarp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hook to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have like a six foot chunk of ducting and
pull that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wrap the plastic around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And make it do a couple S's on the ground
and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The S's are so the light comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to bend your ducting to keep the
lights out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know everybody tells you to keep your
ducting straight, but at this time you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to bend it until you keep light out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that puts a negative pressure on the
greenhouse too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps suck the tarp nice and tight if
you've got it sealed up good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use some timbers, rocks, whatever that is,
or whatever to hold the tarp down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you pull it over, you can have
sandbags, but that'll be on the edges on
[SPEAKER_07]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something heavy enough to keep wind from
lifting, taking your tarp away,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you sunlight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then squeeze clamps from Harbor
Freight, like big old alligator clips.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use those to help secure it all to the PVC
frame and also close up the ends.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wrap the plastic real tight and clamp the
clamps on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a sweet structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some big ass plants to go in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you got some good iry genetics
or some gauge green genetics or something
[SPEAKER_01]: to put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do the opposite with this also,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to keep your growing
season going longer, you can put lights in
[SPEAKER_01]: this greenhouse too, which sounds strange,
but sometimes your plants are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower earlier than you want them to in
some areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a warmer place and then you
can keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you may have to add a heater
later in the season, but if you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get two grows out of it, like we were
talking about, you can pull off that light
[SPEAKER_01]: depth grow, hang up a couple of lights,
veg some plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you have to do when the sun goes down
at night, just turn on one or two lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those will keep your plants awake so
that they don't go into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you're ready, just take the
lights down and you can get that whole
[SPEAKER_07]: other- It can just be CFLs too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to- Yeah, just enough to
keep them awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to stay on all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just walk through every couple of
hours with a light and it'll wake them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just disrupt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they won't hurt them out because
they're out in the sun like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good way to get two full
harvests out of this cheap ... You're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to put a heater in there by
the end of the season if you do it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way, but you'll get two full crops out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing 18 by ... Or are we
doing 12 by 8?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 12 by 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can fit quite a few plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to get you hyped up on
numbers, but- Well, it depends on your
[SPEAKER_07]: container size and your plant size too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're eight feet wide,
you can do either two or three pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, cram them in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two or three.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no need to have a walk space.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need to get in there, just pull the
plants out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's freaking outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like to army crawl through your rooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm big and clumsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave a little bit of dreadlock space
where I'll get a dreadlock hung up on a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 96 square foot of biomass if you do
it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping, lots of training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the plants going.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: 96 square feet of tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's a decent start on light
depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you guys will have questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to email me or Facebook or
something me, Twitter me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bad habit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can Instagram me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call me if you know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because I'll get like text
messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just listen, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, you should email me or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels weird getting it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of bad about answering direct
messages, but I swear I'll do it one of
[SPEAKER_07]: these.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I normally get to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just not very timely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it may take me a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll get to you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to sit down and answer just all of
my emails and Facebook and Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: direct messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go right through it and empty out the
inbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes work though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you assign yourself tasks when
you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can do this for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, oh, there's more
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already kind of, I'm already working.
[SPEAKER_07]: Light depth takes a lot of dedication and
commitment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like ninja status.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the cost of the supplies,
the time you're going to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to pay for any electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sun is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're reliable with getting
out and covering and uncovering every day
[SPEAKER_01]: and not letting, keeping the airflow in
there and not letting it get stagnant in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be cool, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when Sean comes to talk about his
soil recycling, we'll talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about keeping bugs away, unless you guys
want to talk about bugs in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
Prevention.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause prevention.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spinosad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about, yeah, how are we going to keep
bugs away?
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a friend ask me about caterpillars
last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's not a lot you can do about
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once it happens, just manual labor,
pick them out, cut away the rotten spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to call a manual and have them
come pick them out for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a Pueblo thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a local joke.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually used to know a guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He told everyone that was his name.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his first name actually was Manuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we keep the caterpillars from
getting into the grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe I was told those little fuckers
lay their eggs about three weeks before
[SPEAKER_07]: you actually see them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's when it's still pretty early bud
growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially outdoors, they're still
stretching a lot at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just little popcorn nugs on shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Spinosad is something I had great
success with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, I got it in a Monterey spray.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monterey bug spray.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually we don't have that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I bought it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have the Captain Jacks now too,
which actually has more Spinosad in it
[SPEAKER_07]: than Monterey, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neem oil, although, I mean, Neem oil works
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about Spinosad?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a bacteria found in the
bottle of rum barrels.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's good to be used.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be, it's something to be used
strategically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Jesse was saying, it needs to be
well-planned, thought out, talk to other
[SPEAKER_05]: people, figure out when they usually see
these problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good way to put my thoughts on
Neem oil too, strategically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't just spray willy-nilly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you want to apply for reasons at
certain times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to get in tune with your
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you want to utilize everything
that you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have too many options,
especially here in Pueblo with our extreme
[SPEAKER_05]: weather and pests.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a huge variety of pests here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, you're high and dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was a spider mite, I don't want to
live here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Outdoor is the only one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say those words, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, I mean, I've seen crops here
completely wrecked by, here goes organics
[SPEAKER_07]: again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen crops here completely wrecked by
spider mites and powdery mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've never had an issue with them
personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've found that occasionally you'll have
some when the plants come out in the
[SPEAKER_07]: spring and they're very easy to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little Neem oil, maybe some like
lemongrass-based water is very easy to
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the bugs just don't like water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Moisture.
[SPEAKER_07]: The gardens I've seen wrecked by them are
bottle fed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pouring fucking chelated nutrients
into the earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the big problem is that it usually
comes in two situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either A, they don't do anything about it,
and then they just get the infestation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's usually where they want to
come in and treat with like an Eagle 20 or
[SPEAKER_05]: Tetrazan or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the other situation is that they'll
actually use those things on a regular
[SPEAKER_05]: basis as a preventative The plant builds
no sort of self-immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing it for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second that you forget, or the second
that that insect builds up a resistance,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've lost the war.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the trick is prevention.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to go at it, really you want to
go at it systemically.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to add in Neem cake and
crustacean meal, things like that into
[SPEAKER_05]: your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to plan out spray regiments of
Neem oil, essential oils, like he was
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, lemongrass, peppermint oil,
rosemary kills spider mite eggs on
[SPEAKER_05]: contacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you see a little bit of an
infestation, your first thing is to go and
[SPEAKER_05]: remove any stippled, you know,
anything with stippling and then go back
[SPEAKER_05]: through and hit them with some rosemary
oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have rosemary growing in my yard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I go about just taking the raw plant and
utilizing that into.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can go a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's either you can make it like a
traditional essential oil, which is... I
[SPEAKER_05]: have no idea how to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really not that hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of like you mix it,
sit and forget it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you might have to apply some
heat to it or things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other option would be like a cold
process, kind of like a ferment to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: extract those essential oils.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be more like a fermented
plant juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you would go, that would go back
to like the Korean natural farming that I
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of do where you would take the
rosemary or whatever plant you would want,
[SPEAKER_05]: mix it in.
Basil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, you could do mixtures of
them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do personally, I do ginger, garlic,
cinnamon sticks, and then I'll grind all
[SPEAKER_05]: of that up, mix it in with the indigenous
microorganism and EM1.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that's usually how I create a
little, you know, spray off of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have a... Damn, I bet that smells
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my girlfriend actually likes that
when I spray it in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so damn, I'm like, forget what
I'm saying too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, we got to smoke different dabs next
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only took one or two dabs and everybody
looked at me like, I'm high, let's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So preventatives, the stuff you mix up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you just want to... Preventatives
are key.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to plan out your neem sprays,
your essential oil sprays, your spinoside,
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that you're going to use you want
to make sure that you have it planned out
[SPEAKER_05]: on a calendar when you're going to use it
before you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to make things,
like I was saying, you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that you give yourself a month or two in
advance so you can make them and they'll
[SPEAKER_05]: be ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause these are, you know, 30 day
ferments.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And making worm-casting teas and things
has taught me to plan several days ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to start it, you know,
12 to 48 hours before you're actually
[SPEAKER_05]: going to apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, before it's even useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that foamy layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which when you get used to it,
actually it kind of turns out to be a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: easier because you're like, well,
I'm on your way out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start this tea up and you'll hit it
the next day with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it works out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting away from the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got some hoop house action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of got some ideas on how to keep away
the bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the one thing you talk about a
lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Caranja meal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's neem and then there's Caranja.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear a lot of people talk about like a
neem and Caraja 50-50 mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_05]: The big difference is that like neem oil
technically has like, what's the word I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost like birth control style properties
to it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which for human health reasons and Caraja
oil doesn't.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of my basic understanding
is that they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically Caraja oil is a hell of a lot
cheaper to source.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least Caraja meal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never personally used Caraja oil
specifically, but it's basically the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing as neem.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me curious about these birth
control properties now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you really want some birth control
properties, go use Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make you twitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't get laid at all because your
eyes are twitching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely birth control right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to see if I got over all the
stuff we wrote down because we're coming
[SPEAKER_01]: up on 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to keep this about an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed we get a lot more lessons
when we go like 50 instead of 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran out of our attention though.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of my problem is I'm over here making
notes and reading shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are just high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got over all the stuff that I wrote
down on this page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promised you guys I'll get you a coupon
code at the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw that in right at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, one of the cool words I learned
today, Nutritive Cycle Theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to do that again and
read more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: The good old NCT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just made that up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's new to me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a couple of posts up about it on
my feed and then Rocky Mountain Natural
[SPEAKER_05]: Farming's page.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a little post about it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, make sure you check out the Rocky
Mountain Natural Farming and the Rocky
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All their internet stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will learn so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in some headphones and go type in
Rocky Mountain Worm Company and just click
[SPEAKER_01]: on links and see where you end up and see
what you learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you read on there is useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just read it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you have a question,
just comment and ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring Sean back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, this guy asked this question
and Sean will come and he'll say,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the answer young Jedi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll all learn to grow like a pro here
organically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every bit of this applies to your gardens,
to corn, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: All that good stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use warm castings on all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not just pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that, and you don't have to buy
everything at the hydro store either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's their other store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to say that since the hydro
shop is a sponsor, but you can go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farming store and the regular grow store.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a nursery around here that sells
grow supplies, but they don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: grow lights or anything, but they've got
lots of great amendments and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a garden supply store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to those places too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture, horticulture stores,
supply stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And support your local economy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know why you're there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't rub it in their face.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a garden store, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're on that level buying that
stuff, you know the etiquette by now
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to us, we don't have
to remind you to not walk into the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: store and be like, my weed plants need
more nitrogen, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, go in there and just be- At our local
one, I've seen more than one person get
[SPEAKER_07]: kicked out of there for- Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll completely make you leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, man, I'm here for the exact same
thing, but I'm not a dick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked a joint in the car on the way,
so we smell lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, what's up,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I forget, I wrote down this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Lynn's, big shout out to
Judy, big shout out to Dreadful J,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also everyone to- or shout out to
everyone from Bonk TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something important that I wrote
down because I'm high and forgetful today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have any final magnificent
words of wisdom towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: show here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Grow meeting March 6th at Hy-Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: March 6th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write that down because I'm
forgetful today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lost my pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did- what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be sure to be there for that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us- I don't have a topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have a topic, but I don't know how-
yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a new one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw us an ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, new Grow- the next Grow meeting at
Hy-Grow Indoor Growing Supplies in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_01]: March 6th, 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any reason why I wouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless fish comes to town or something,
I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get a lot of cool people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come meet us, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Armando Vigil, this is your personal
invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to hang out and meet you for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come down, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people that have been trying to
hang out with us, us growers can't leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, come hang out with us at these grower
meetings because we've just committed to
[SPEAKER_01]: being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll all be there all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to teach you a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to learn a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just added it into the calendar,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that- Oh, it's official now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse will put it on Facebook and that
will make it super official.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook official.
[SPEAKER_07]: February 27th, we're going to do another
free tea day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a great response from that and
request to do it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I was like, hell, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the tea being brewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was marvelous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you mix that yourself?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rocky Mountain Earthworm castings and
molasses.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I put a little alfalfa in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Miniscule amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it bubbly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it bubbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me what you're warming with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that shit was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is going to get out of hand if we
do the worm puns again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got any shout outs, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as always, shout out to Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everybody who's helping us out
over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, the big toker, Nick, you know,
coming on last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously you for having us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for coming on and giving me
great content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You two are probably, you guys and Clint
are my most listened to guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this one's probably going to blow up
since you're both here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like superhero status.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Clint?
[SPEAKER_07]: Come do a show with us sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a funny motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like training wheels because he
doesn't know anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not even being a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does not know shit about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like weed ignorant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll be saying stuff and he'll look
over at me like, what does all that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got, oh yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should tell everybody what that means
because we just talked like pros and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still learning with training
wheels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have them come ask us questions
about organics beginner.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, from a dude who doesn't even,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come quiz us, Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come ask us the stuff that we've talked to
quickly over and lost people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come remind us to slow down.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll give you six questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, we'll give you six
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's never taken a dab before,
so I don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not ready to give a dude six dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Deez said that he's coming to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend told him that his first dab
he's going to take is a gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have been trying strongly to
discourage that from happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's insisting on taking a gram dab
for his first try.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deez, listen to my friends here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know you and they advise
against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just going to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him he's going to fuck up his whole
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then everybody's going to laugh at
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to look like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to eat and then go
lay down and then wake up like 10 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: later and eat again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to cough for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it, Deez.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to feel like shit for
probably 30 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming from three people that
really smoke a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do gram dabs and a gram dab is a big ass
dab for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half gram is a little more than I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Point three is comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people do about point one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just dick waving.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there's no need to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Jeff has his reasons and he's very
aware that it's just dick waving.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty good at waving his dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it when that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're not sure if you're going to
come, have a stroke, a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: heart attack, or if you want to jump up
and high five all your friends all at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time from a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what a point five does to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheerleader dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheerleader dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheerleader dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, when you take a big dab,
your arms just start moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me an A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not even trying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Similar to the Josh Blue.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was straight from Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, he'd laugh his ass off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Josh Blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Josh a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I hope you paid attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you learned a whole bunch of stuff
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you learned how to build your own
outdoor hoop house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're going to build a hoop house
in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're going to grow a whole bunch
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you, your neighbors, their
neighbors, their neighbors, and all your
[SPEAKER_01]: other neighbors are going to be like,
damn, whose weed smells so good because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody is growing a big plot of outdoor
cannabis this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happens on the county road I hang around
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't bust us all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't take down every crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow some
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach your friend how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're teaching your friends how to
grow, teach one of your friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: teach two of your friends about the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you teach one person,
they'll get high and forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you tell two people, the chances are
one of those people might come and listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So teach more people about the show while
we're teaching everyone to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're- Make your mom listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your mom listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab your mom, make her listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: She might think that weed's a devil and
she'll listen to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problems we had today was we all
forgot what the hell we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse needed extra water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could already have ADHD, but I could
barely sit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a very hard time sitting still
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you're the construction guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you build shit all day because
you're like, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to build things.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I smoke indica, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do that to you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's all cool with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made these lemon Jeffrey dads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone had some sour diesel the other day
and it was very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cousin Tater there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Cousin Tater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good luck, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cousin Tater.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a bunch of my genetics and he's
been killing it with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: He does well with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd give him a best new grower of the year
that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Adam, let's get Adam that award
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make Adam the best new grower of the
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to earn it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not giving it to you yet,
but that's what we want from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you to be the best new grower that
we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're part of the grow crew now,
like it or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: He does what he's told to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: He puts the lotion on the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more whip for Adam again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to close the show with all that
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called Sean and I was like, can you be
here like a half hour for a podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, sure, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a super busy guy.

[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, organic and sustainably.

[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get Alan from the Worm
Company on here, like it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll duct tape him and drag him in here
and make him talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if I say, tell him about worms,
he'll just start going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I need to do is just get
him here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep listening, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting better.

[SPEAKER_01]: chaotic.

[SPEAKER_01]: Please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the iTunes store or... Stitcher's
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to find where to make comments.

[SPEAKER_01]: Stitcher keeps changing the way
everything's done on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to find a spot for comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's hard for me to read the
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can find them, I'll read them for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel bad if I skip you on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that place is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free, so I can't complain.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I listen to it at most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of good ratings on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were ranked, there are... You know,
I kept saying 25,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only 15,000 shows on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were ranked 888 for a couple of
episodes, around 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that time period, we were really
kicking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked lately because I don't
want to get too excited or disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 888 out of 15,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more than another podcast that's on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more than... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that week, we may have been the
leading cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even dissing anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, holy shit, we've done
that.
