[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, ladies and jelly spoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are gathered here today for episode 466
of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of copper
chem full spectrum extract from Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross of Chem 4 and Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, the flavor is described as
guava juice and watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I dab it, I get more of a gassy
watermelon, gassy strawberry sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still a delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this product
contains 67.94% THC and zero CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy and appreciate the copper
chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is perfect and the buzz is
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a big shout out to our friends at
Green Dot Labs for the amazing copper chem
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, I'm going to read a
couple of emails in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but before we get there, let's do a couple
of shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a giant Grow From

[SPEAKER_00]: you to our friend Melvin818.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Meredith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
shout out and a thank you to Ethan G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast fist bump and a thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: Gregory S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for all of the
continued Patreon support.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, boys and girls, I did say that
I was going to read some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode actually came to me from
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know that this person wants their
identity revealed, so we're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: jump right into this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to reach out and let you
know that I really appreciate the info and
[SPEAKER_00]: insights that you provide on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a great way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I just listened to
episode 465 and you hit the nail on the
[SPEAKER_00]: head with the CHS topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I got so many responses and so
many emails on the CHS topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to do a recap and a revision on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon I will have to because my YouTube
channel is just exploding with comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is the first one that I printed
before they all flooded in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the one we're going to focus on
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out that without a patient
diagnosis, our doctors cannot get paid
[SPEAKER_00]: from the insurance companies for your
visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he's saying is when you go to the
doctor and they examine you, if they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: write down a word of something that is
wrong with you and have a title for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because there is no test or even any
studies to back the CHS theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is often used as an easy diagnosis that
is hard to argue against as the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are not doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, that's probably what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a diagnosis and they can move
on to the next patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, many doctors are forced to
see too many patients in too little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that it's not the doctor's goal
and idea to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a practice of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how the hospital and how any
sort of medical places run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a patient, but you are mainly a
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do need a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get you out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very hard to argue that as a
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I ended up finding out that I get
migraines after two years of studies and
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, with most doctors trying to blame
my medical cannabis use as soon as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of the very few people that
suffer from migraines with nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they wrap up the message by saying,
sorry for the rant, take a fat dab and
[SPEAKER_00]: give your mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign it with great work as
always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am for sure going to take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's touch on this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person gets migraines and also gets
nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doctors were immediately
attributing it to his cannabis use or
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not mention their gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should stop assigning genders to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong and that could be
offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this person went to the doctor
and they kept getting told that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person believes that since the doctor
could not find a reasonable explanation
[SPEAKER_00]: for their symptoms, they simply wrote it
off as CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be really dangerous and
really frustrating because after more
[SPEAKER_00]: tests and more research and of course more
money being spent, this person found out
[SPEAKER_00]: that they actually have migraines that
cause nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably does not have anything to do
with CHS or cannabis hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that happens when
anybody is trying to diagnose a problem or
[SPEAKER_00]: do some sort of investigation or maybe a
repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're on a path and you're just
thinking, what could the problem be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got these doctors have very
limited time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to focus on you for 10 or 12
minutes and get out of the room and get
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the next patient so they can just
keep writing receipts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should do a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many great doctors who do great
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, many of the emergency room
doctors, many of the affordable doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: are forced to work under less than
desirable conditions, but they'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to pay for medical school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got fucking needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need groceries and rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're forced to work in whatever type
of environment they can find employment
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably isn't their choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing too many patients a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing patients for too short of a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a very short timeframe to come
up with the diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say, well, I also smoke
cannabis, that little bell goes off,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at all the other things on the
map and they go, yeah, nothing makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to write down CHS next.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the all, all of the above on the
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with it, move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case for the doctor,
unfortunately, there is no repercussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just write that down and move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the patient has to deal
with that for their life or until they do
[SPEAKER_00]: get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fortunately, or I guess,
unfortunately, either way, fortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: this person was able to find a doctor that
could figure out what really was wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been diagnosed with nausea
and vomiting associated with migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until they found the right doctor,
they were just going to be getting told
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong diagnosis just to be blown off
and just to get that insurance money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great message that came in
right after the episode came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to grab that one printed out
and read that here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have found something to
alleviate the pain, the nausea and the
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting from those migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Migraines are terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a traumatic brain injury for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very light sensitive and very noise
sensitive and very everything sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: due to a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what it is like to have a
migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand those symptoms and I
definitely hope you've got that under
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thank you for the great message and
thank you for supporting my theory a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit with the CHS that it is kind of
just a label for lazy doctors to write
[SPEAKER_00]: down so they could say they found a
diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent more time on that one than I
wanted to, so I'm going to quickly move to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one did directly come through the
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there would like to send me
an email, my email address is grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they want their names set
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to scan really quickly to hear
if they want their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, you can use my name if you read
this on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friend Brian B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is an email from Brian B.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, your podcast is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for taking time to
deliver such a high quality growing
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I really like the way this is
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always look forward to listening to your
podcast because the sound quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: superb and you have the perfect radio
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do put a lot of effort into making sure
that the sound of the show is top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of an audio nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was into that way before I became a
podcaster or got into podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate knowing and hearing that
it sounds good and then hearing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a radio voice really is embarrassing
because I don't like my voice at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me 50 episodes to get comfortable
hearing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is just normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate that because I don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is funny when people like you've
got that smooth radio voice, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: when dudes say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much from your podcast and
I have applied as much as I could to my
[SPEAKER_00]: second ever grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the bud turned out really good
with your help and your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says I was growing rock steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad the rock steady worked well
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a huge contributing factor to the
quality of your outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, however, I wanted to
ask you a question regarding curing
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have read many forums online
with conflicting information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, PS, I know you don't
recommend reading forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted some quick info related to
the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Brian is very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I don't recommend
getting your information from the online
[SPEAKER_00]: forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a ton of bullshit and false
information on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is also a ton of quality
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are smart enough to sift through
it, if you were smart enough to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons, if you can read five articles
and say this one sounds like shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: these two make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I should probably go with
and then just disregard one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably you should be able to figure out
which articles are bullshit and which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes some sense once you get a little bit
of experience and you have a basic
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, those forums can be really
confusing and really misleading and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can really cause you more problems than
they can do you good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite often I say to avoid the forums
unless you are able to sift through the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those forums that were feeding people
bullshit are a big part of why I do this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw a group in Facebook where a
person was telling somebody to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants based on the ripeness or the
brownness of the hairs on their plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying now that the pistols are
brown, it is time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not smoking pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols don't have shit to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want ripe trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not pay any attention to the
pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the forums and the internet can
be bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also who's to say that I know what I'm
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I've come on here and said at
least three wrong things before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just got to be very careful to
filter out the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get your information from a
qualified source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to believe that is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with this email
because this copper chem from Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs has got me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Does the curing process stop at
54 percent when you were curing in jars?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud that I grew started at 70 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's talking about 70 percent moisture
content, humidity in the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was gradually trying to bring it
down to 55 percent through burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it got away from me one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, the humidity in the
various jars ranged from 52 to 55 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was burping the jar slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: His intention was to start off at 70 and
then you seal the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the jar is in there,
the moisture kind of gathers into the jar,
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes out of the buds and it sweats out
of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture in the air ends up in the
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a process to that that we'll talk
about in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture is able to release the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air and the moisture come out of the
jar that will also bring out chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chlorophyll has now been turned into
a gas and it is releasing that from that
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you seal the jar back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a little less moisture in the
jar because we've just let a portion of it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seal it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we give the opportunity for more of
that moisture within the bud to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sweats out of the bud and becomes
atmospheric into the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We open the jar and it escapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with that process, we're turning
chlorophyll from a chlorophyll pigment
[SPEAKER_00]: into a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gas allows that chlorophyll to leave
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we open the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do that multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time we want to reduce the humidity
in that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, three, maybe five percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do it over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it sounds like Brian got carried away
and maybe possibly left the jar open for
[SPEAKER_00]: too long or something went wrong and he
has got some cannabis in the jars where
[SPEAKER_00]: the relative humidity are ranging from 52
to 55 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll get back into the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have since brought the bud back
up to 58 to 59 percent relative humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: by using cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, if you get your herb too
dry, it is okay to pull a couple of leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the garden and drop those right
into your curing jar and seal it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be very careful because you will be
amazed at how much moisture is in that bud
[SPEAKER_00]: or in that leaf and how quickly it goes
into that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just pay attention so you don't mold
it up, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on that jar very often, very soon,
more frequently than you think you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I recommend to use a cannabis
leaf is because it is the same bricks
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to make any funky aromas or
flavors in your finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting the same kind of plant in
the same kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will recommend other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will recommend fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People recommend maybe like a Q-tip with
moisture on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will use a humidity pack from
different brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabis leaf is probably free and
probably available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's use that and not fuck up the
flavors and aromas of our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian has put leaves into the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has got the humidity back up where he
wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here's where the question comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have read in many forums that
the cure is over once the humidity drops
[SPEAKER_00]: below 54% and you cannot re-initiate the
curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can re-moisturize the bud,
obviously, but is the curing state
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely over once the relative humidity
drops lower than 54%?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not able to give you a solid
scientific answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to be completely honest and
transparent that that is a science
[SPEAKER_00]: question that is a little bit past what I
am qualified for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can speak from experience and I can give
you bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are curing our plants,
our goal is to seal the buds in a
[SPEAKER_00]: container and that will create a gas
inside of that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light, the oxygen and the moisture
work together to create a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gas will begin to eat the chlorophyll
and turn that chlorophyll into a gas
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we open the jar like I talked
about earlier, that gas is released from
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that will continue, like you said,
until we get to about 54% relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity seems to be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the part where I lack
scientific education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, in my experience, have noticed that
once I let the buds get past that dry
[SPEAKER_00]: point, the chlorophyll does not,
it is not able to be removed any further
[SPEAKER_00]: once that amount of moisture is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that moisture is required to
create the chemical reaction that creates
[SPEAKER_00]: the breakdown of the chlorophyll that
allows it to become a gas to allow it to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove itself from the plant into the jar,
into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it gets too dry, you will not be
able to remove more chlorophyll and more
[SPEAKER_00]: pigments in my experience and opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds may still taste a little grassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have a little bit of harshness to
them depending on how long you let them
[SPEAKER_00]: stay moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this took long enough, you may have
gotten all of that chlorophyll out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a nice sweet cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the timeframe in which you
let it slip once it got too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you did a good job,
so you should have at least a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is another aspect of drying and
curing to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we want to cure to remove
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is that natural reaction that I was
talking about a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we seal the product in a jar,
the gases and the moisture all start
[SPEAKER_00]: working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates an environment that breaks down
the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows the chlorophyll to become a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That green pigment that doesn't taste good
has now become air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we open the jar, we let that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is floating around in the room and such
minute particles, we don't notice it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the good part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part is trichome ripeness and
trichome preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on other environmental factors
and when the product was harvested,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may still be ripening your trichomes
during that curing process also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main question was, is the curing
state entirely over once the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity has dropped lower than 54%?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be pulling the chlorophyll
out, but you are still slow drying that
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is getting drier just naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is losing a little bit of moisture
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still may be breaking down and you are
absolutely getting trichome ripeness and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid conversions are still
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is happening inside of that jar
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take some buds out now and smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would leave some in there for a week and
smoke those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just one, just a bowl, maybe a
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a vaporizer bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're putting in the
vaporizer, but just consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have one sesh of a bowl today and then a
bowl in a week and then a bowl in two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can conserve it,
a bowl in a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're fucking crazy,
a bowl in two months and try to compare,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what the differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to notice all the subtleties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people don't have the palette or
don't care to develop the palette to taste
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the subtleties in a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people won't clean the pipe and even
give it an effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it all tastes like weed to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can taste subtleties and many different
flavors in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a nice clean pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate smoking a bowl of the
same herb that has been kind of dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured and then pretty dried and cured and
then really dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one's been going for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate hitting a bowl of all
of those and being like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one tastes pretty good and make some
notes and then try to remember a week
[SPEAKER_00]: later and be like, oh man, that does taste
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would write down like gassy,
grapey, smooth, burns my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would breathe some of it through my nose
just to see what it feels like through the
[SPEAKER_00]: nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just breathe different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They serve beer in different shaped beer
glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you buy certain kinds of beer,
they serve it in different glasses at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bar because the air creates a different
flavor for those beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're smoking cannabis or
concentrates, make your mouth in different
[SPEAKER_00]: funny shapes and blow the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow the smoke around in different shapes
in your mouth and you'll taste different
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack a bowl of weed and don't light it and
just draw through the pipe and taste it
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get that fresh herb, grassy dank
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then light it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that smoke all in your lungs and then
blow it out like you normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the flavor going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it goes in, stop breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't like die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that air stops, your tongue will
catch the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll taste it going out also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to end flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stop flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to out flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to taste like something as soon
as it gets out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're patient, just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let your tongue relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple seconds later, you're going to
get a bunch of different subtle flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the flavors I really look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after that, exhale and then relax
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll breathe in through my nose
and then out through my mouth and then
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in through my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just getting different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm activating different flavors,
different parts of my tongue, different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of my palate, different turps are
working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am noticing many subtle different
flavors that probably many people didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: take the time or didn't know they had the
ability to even detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to kind of hone your
palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something I would approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap back around the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did get off on a weird rant about
how to smoke and smell and taste
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, but not all is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoothen up the flavor of that
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still cannabinoid conversions
and things are still happening inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is no, not all is
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process is not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull some out, smoke it, pull some out
later, smoke it and take notes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrapped this one up to say,
sorry for the lengthy email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure I showed you
some love, but also give you enough
[SPEAKER_00]: details to answer my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Brian B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, you can use my name if
you read this on the show.
