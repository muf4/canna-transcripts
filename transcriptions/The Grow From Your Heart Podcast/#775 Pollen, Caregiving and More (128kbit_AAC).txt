[SPEAKER_00]: That one will be coming shortly after
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when it comes to ordering on
iRedirect, or this may count, just about
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ordering things online,
if you're purchasing things through the
[SPEAKER_00]: mail, let's put our real names on the
package or at least a friendly name,
[SPEAKER_00]: a usable name on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy and I appreciate and I respect the
work you're doing to create your own
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've made a cool Instagram name that is
whatever, something crazy hash company
[SPEAKER_00]: that is your new name or something seed
company or something farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you, but you don't have to
put it on every shipping label when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sending and receiving something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less information on that label that is
unnecessary is the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your name and your address on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm talking about is I get orders
that'll say like, the order will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just making shit up right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you did this, it'll say like to
Bill Smith from Ganja Farms Incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: in Plano, Texas or Seattle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter where it is,
but when you put Ganja Farms Incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: or Big Fat Weed Farm or whatever on the
fucking shipping label, that makes it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a couple of suspicions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the mail, the post office,
the mail carrier, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, who's fucking Ganja Supreme Ganja
Farm 420 weed smoker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to know what the
fuck is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe somebody in your area knows that
you're ordering seeds and they see that
[SPEAKER_00]: name or they've recognized that name come
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pop it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start stealing your shit
because it's a very noticeable name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blend in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be Bill Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be Jane Doe when it comes to the fucking
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice, my recommendation,
my suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people type in random,
weird names when they're ordering through
[SPEAKER_00]: iRedirect and I try my best to delete
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pay a lot of attention to
correcting addresses, but if I see that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got like weed grow fuck,
farms or weed warrior 420 or some shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: your name, I do try to remove that because
we don't need our packages opened up,
[SPEAKER_00]: inspected and taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sending seeds is not illegal, but don't
encourage anybody to mess with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: steal from you or cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your brain, use your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your company will go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you for having the company
name, but you don't have to put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put, I read genetics on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put grow from your heart podcast
on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mail is discreet and careful and very
adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my first rant for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be more pro when we're putting our
names on packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also package shit more carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to package things where they won't
get smushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send them in a priority mailbox,
get a lot of seeds that come in a bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: mailer and they're totally squished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more careful, be more professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on the other end of that,
if you've sent me seeds as a gift
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them and I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to all my
friends in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I've mentioned this on the
podcast yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand is now part of the team
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand has legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some great friends over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they want their names said
or not, but I'm going to say them right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are killing it in the Thailand legal
cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got commercial cultivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a flow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got standard operating procedures
for selling legal cannabis in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you doing it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Thailand, look for some
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strains and the seeds are on shelves
out there in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to everyone in Thailand who fought
for and succeeded with the legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last piece of little rambling before
we get to the email portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fresh t-shirts on the
iRegenetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to iregenetics.com, click on the
Merge tab that will take you to the store
[SPEAKER_00]: where I do sell my merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find new t-shirts, you will find
long sleeve shirts, you will find hoodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will find women's tank tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all got the cross logo on the
front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit the website, grab your shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cool kids are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that was the last, but I do have
one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just shameless advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies, I was talking with your boyfriend
and I heard him say that he wanted some
[SPEAKER_00]: new iRegenetics seeds for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place to get them is iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case you're not sure where to get
your man his Christmas seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every man that smokes, grows, enjoys
ganja, wants some new seeds for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: iredirect.com is the place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's do the fun part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy reading and answering listener
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I call listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this because I know that if I'm
helping my friend, Shep, who sent me this
[SPEAKER_00]: message, one person has this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know if one listener has this question,
there are probably several people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that this could help and be benefit
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send those to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: on the website at iregenetics.com or
simply use my email growfromyourheart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this message came from my buddy
Shep and it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can pick it up, it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ross DeGeoff, maybe you've discussed
this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, my apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will repeat subjects on here because
I've realized that not everybody listens
[SPEAKER_00]: to every single episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't go back and listen to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dedicated certain kind of podcast
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people jump in and they just
catch the future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have talked about this possibly,
but we'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I grow in a three by three Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recently had a cannabis variety that
is female, including a female test from a
[SPEAKER_00]: very reputable reputable and well known
breeder in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says in parentheses, it was not
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not one of my lines we're
talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this is a nine to 11 week variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: At week five, day 38 in bloom,
I found two male flower clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're growing what you thought and
assumed and probably was tested to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it was a feminine seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought it was a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at day 38, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This female plant is now showing intersex
traits, which is a problem, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: around week five of a nine to 11 week
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I found two male clusters below
the Scrog screen, very much in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the buds down below the
Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a screen, the light's hitting
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the light doesn't get down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part down there is where we are
discovering the intersex parts of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, unfortunately, I miss these
little bastards and two male flowers have
[SPEAKER_00]: opened before I found and removed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got opened up flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're popped open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they've been expressed is the
word we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that they probably let out some
pollen into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen is super light, does not take
a lot of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that pollen to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, question, since these male
flowers were below the Scrog, below the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, just how bad could this be?
[SPEAKER_00]: How badly seeded do you think my buds will
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what are the odds that the pollen
will be fertile?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no male flower anywhere else
on this plant other than these in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shade, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and best wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question, since these flowers
were below the Scrog, just how bad could
[SPEAKER_00]: it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a moment ago that pollen travels
very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is really light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, sometimes it goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pollen move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a little bit of airflow,
the wind directed off something or
[SPEAKER_00]: ricochet, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pollen actually move up into the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could have gone up into your full
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make you paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you any false hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have gone up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it might not have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much pollen those few
male flowers opened up, but they did let
[SPEAKER_00]: some pollen out, possibly, and it probably
went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that pollen works.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they pop open, they kind of have a
little pressure to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they just breathe out just a
little bit to let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really we can't tell until a couple of
probably a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see little kernels happening,
and that's where the seeds are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like something just went weird,
like your calyxes are swollen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the odds this pollen could be
sterile or fertile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be either way, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could definitely be either way,
and it says there have been no male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay very close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got six more weeks to go,
possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably take this shit down early and
then not grow it ever again is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would do, but pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have produced a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have produced a lot of seeds,
and that's where I go on that one rant
[SPEAKER_00]: where I say, grow those seeds,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have just made a bunch of great
seeds for yourself to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may, like I've said in a past episode,
you may have just created gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the new chem dog,
the new golden goat, the new gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the new Scheps OG in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what you just made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you could have made a bunch of
intersex plants that stress out and
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite and show problems as soon as
they get a light leak, too much
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature problem or too much shade or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow those seeds if they do happen,
but I honestly, without looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the room, getting in there with
the light and kind of looking around,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you enough details to give
you any diagnosis or prognosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have been fully fertile or
fully sterile flowers that opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen could have been good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see any dust?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any dust laying around those
male flowers, like the leaves around it
[SPEAKER_00]: may just have like, it just looks like you
sprinkled them with powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a bad sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no dust, then chances are a
little bit better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all I think I've got for you
for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on it, and then if you do see
seeds, forming, you've got decisions to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to finish it or do you want to
chop it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then definitely consider if you ever
want to run that particular cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: again, because it did freak out just from
a little bit of shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that I would
tolerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shep, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another message that came from
our friend Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Ross to Jeff, I hope you're
doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the recent Grateful Dog episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great response to that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one question that stemmed from
that is can I get seeds or buy a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one answer for that is no,
not right now, maybe in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I'm not selling clones or seeds of
that one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crossing things with it, but there
will be a Jack the Ripper Grateful Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: cross available very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Dog Ripper, but we're not
selling the Grateful Dog right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, also, I have got a question for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When would you consider a home grower
ready to advance to the role of caregiver?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have any advice regarding
scaling up a grow over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about what the word caregiver
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I'm going to say applies to
the Colorado medical cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of this is info from around 2008,
2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, we have changed the term
from caregiver to provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started medical cannabis,
a lot of people wanted access to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis without going to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got your medical cannabis
recommendation from a doctor, it gave you
[SPEAKER_00]: the right to grow six or more plants,
depending on the paperwork you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were allowed to grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the catch was some of these people
were very sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were receiving medical cannabis for a
reason, which also limited their ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they were sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they were physically unable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just didn't have the room,
the space, and, of course, the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what those people would do is they
would assign somebody that would be called
[SPEAKER_00]: a caregiver to produce their medical
cannabis products for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I go to the weed doctor,
the weed doctor gives me a paper and it
[SPEAKER_00]: says, you can smoke and grow and have
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on that card, there's a spot that
says, who is your caregiver?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find a friend or we would find
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would find me and they
would list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just put me as the caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike, I've got your permission to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm going to use Mike as an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the medical cannabis thing came up,
our good friend, White Mike, he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes the way I grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he asked me one day, want to be one of
my caregiver?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I would be honored to,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then at that point, he wrote my name on
his card and sent it into the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives me the right to grow Mike's
medical marijuana plants for him so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could have those in my possession,
in my cultivation area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be fully legal because I was
Mike's caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when that weed was ready,
it was my responsibility to provide Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were not many legal stipulations or
bylines or guidelines or bylaws or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about how I could give Mike his
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't supposed to make a profit from
it, is what I think that the paperwork
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could definitely charge Mike for
electricity, my time, my seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I felt necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't supposed to profit off of
Mike for it, which I never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike always got the hookups on the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my responsibility and my role as a
caregiver was to grow safe, effective
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for Mike and supply it on the
rhythm that Mike expected his medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: he needed his medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would tell me what he liked the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would grow that and I would have it
when he needed it at a price he could
[SPEAKER_00]: afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I just gave it to him
because that was just the bond that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked the way that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me the ability to grow more plants
because I had his medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kept me legal and safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just grow enough and make sure to set
some aside for Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any time he needed it, there it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best parts about that is being
Mike's best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the car all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're next to each other in the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the dab table together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Mike's physical ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Mike's mental state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what Mike likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what flavors Mike enjoys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to really dial in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I together got to dial in what
medicine Mike was receiving and what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: providing for Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that he loves Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he could have Grateful Dog seven days a
week, 24 hours a day, that's what Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: would smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could see it on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, it's about time for Mike to
get some weed because I could see his body
[SPEAKER_00]: and his facial expression change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to smoke Mike out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to develop a real bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the caregiver idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be assigned as his caregiver and
then I could grow cannabis for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he needed that cannabis,
it would be ready for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he needed edibles, topicals,
oils, whatever, it would be my
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility as his caregiver and friend
to make that product available and ready
[SPEAKER_00]: for him for his consumption needs to fix
his ailments, to improve the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: his life was the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what a caregiver is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to provide cannabis for a
medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, they have changed the term to
provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just write provider in the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've also really limited us now in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you were allowed to have
like unlimited counts to where you could
[SPEAKER_00]: just get everybody could be, you could be
everybody's caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like everybody in the neighborhood,
I would be Clint, Mike, my mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking the neighbor, the neighbor down
the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was all of their caregiver and I was
just growing so much herb and providing
[SPEAKER_00]: herb for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I understood what people like,
what people want, how often they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot by doing that sort of
stuff that got me that definitely worked
[SPEAKER_00]: well in the medical cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would do what was called card
stacking is I would have everybody's cards
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would just grow for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd put all their plants in one
cultivation area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the state came down and said,
you can only have six patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: which limited me to that would be six
times six is thirty six plus my six.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was forty two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then counties started saying, oh,
you're only limited to twelve plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have your six recreational and
your six medical plants, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to grow more than that,
which the states and counties are the
[SPEAKER_00]: cities and counties are allowed to do that
sort of stuff within their own boundaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and borders, their own what's it called,
their own council.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what happened a lot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're just limited to twelve and I
can grow twelve plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically keep it down to ten females
and two boys is what we basically do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the twelve count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the role of the caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a caregiver does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is expected to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our friend Matt here is asking,
when is the when do you know it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider a home grower ready to advance to
the role of caregiver?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really thin line that you're
skating there between caregiver and home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that it worked for me is people
enjoyed smoking the herb that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: People sought me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you are and this sounds
egotistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, I don't know about now,
but at the time around here, I was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the best and most noticed weed growers
that there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up real quick and people noticed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people wanted me to be their
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I was involved in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that put me out there a lot and I got
to be a lot of people's caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people knew that I was growing good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew that I knew how to interact with
people and have conversations and build
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships and that I'm compassionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the other word?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got empathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just like to connect with
people and I care about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the way that when you smoke,
you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that just made me, I had the
caregiver mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people sought me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say, how you know when
you're ready, are people, are there people
[SPEAKER_00]: in need of medical cannabis knocking down
your door for the weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there people, have you made a
relationship with one or two people who
[SPEAKER_00]: just really love what you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, my buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say Mike, Kevin and Pops were
probably three of my main patients that I
[SPEAKER_00]: took care of that I was provided their
caregiver, assigned their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three dudes will tell you that I
grew the best weed they've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three guys, that's why I was their
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was their friend and I also grew the
best herb they could smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got somebody that's saying,
Hey Matt, do you have any more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: weed you grew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Matt, do you have any more of that
weed you grew?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one thing you grow is the only thing
that makes me feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's time for you to step up
and become a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there comes great responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you provide the product which that
patient requires on the timeline which
[SPEAKER_00]: they require it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they smoke an ounce a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they smoke two ounces a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you handle that demand sustainably?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for a month or two you can do it,
but can you do it for the next three to
[SPEAKER_00]: five years without missing a beat to keep
that person medicated perfectly and
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you grow like a, what's it called,
a surplus so that when you've got to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation or clean up the room or if a
power outage happens and you fucking lose
[SPEAKER_00]: a crop, can you back up surplus enough,
stockpile enough to make sure that person
[SPEAKER_00]: has got their medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your realistic limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you provide a quality a safe,
ethical, quality product for this person
[SPEAKER_00]: on the timeline which they require it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, build a relationship with
them, find out what they need,
[SPEAKER_00]: find out what they like best, and start
providing caregiver services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get in over your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do one or two people,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to cover the cost of
this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to charge them a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to charge other people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to give the fucking medical
patients weed for really, really cheap if
[SPEAKER_00]: not free, and I would sell black market
weed to the other people and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that didn't have any medical
recommendation or didn't even talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: medical weed, just the stoners and my bros
and the gangsters, they'd pay full fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the patients, they would get some free
shit and they would get some hookup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to decide how you want to
run that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to run this like a business but
a little bit different than a business
[SPEAKER_00]: because most businesses kind of just run
about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all about compassion and taking
care of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to pay attention to the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to cover your own costs?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to buy soil, nutrients,
lights, air, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that costs something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to pay for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be a donation basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they give you so much a month and you
let them have what they need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that before you even get into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to them about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, hey, Rasta Jeff said we should
talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting conversations is awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say Rasta Jeff said we should talk
about this before I be your caregiver or
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking play this episode and be like,
hey, here's the things we should talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to pay for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get compensated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about all those things and figure it
out so that you can still be friends if
[SPEAKER_00]: something does go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important part of all that
is that we're all still friends after all
[SPEAKER_00]: the chips fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I think you know when you're
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a customer or a client or a
friend requesting your product and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got faith in yourself that you can provide
that product consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advice on scaling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important things is
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can your house handle electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can your building facility, wherever
you're growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm imagining you're in a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can your home handle that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, are you ready to have... So cannabis
is a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a valuable commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a profitable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're entering the arena of having a
profitable product on hand in your home
[SPEAKER_00]: and it sounds like you're about to upscale
the amount of that product you have and is
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced which will make you double,
triple, quadruple the size of a target
[SPEAKER_00]: which you already are.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may not know you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Law enforcement, thieves, crooks,
crackheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them may know that you're growing
but when you start scaling up things will
[SPEAKER_00]: become more obvious and more apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more people coming and going
from your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be buying more products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make some money be careful that
when you make money you don't come up too
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and show people that you got a brand
new car and a bunch of chains if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: a place where you shouldn't be making a
little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when things do happen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of my first pieces of advice
would be to don't scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximize what you have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the room, the space, the environment
that you have got to its full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pulling one pound now try to get
two pounds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting two aim for four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximize that before you even consider
moving up to a bigger grow and adding more
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, more toys, more money,
more responsibility, more opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have people relying on you
so if this crop does fail it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more detrimental than if you're personal
smoke failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit up one of the homies and get
some black market herb if you need to but
[SPEAKER_00]: this person they're relying on you so you
have got to produce that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that politically correct anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the gray market, the free market?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go get your product if
your crop fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our patients do not have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are relying on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that we are growing that product
safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's the strain they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that it's the potency they want
at the frequent that they need it so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to rely on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't scale up too big and fuck things up
because that does happen quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are scaling up make sure that
your electricity can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too much work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a trim crew that can manage
that harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that be possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say scale up to one light next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go like from one light to four
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go from one to two and then maybe from two
to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for a one man operation and a good
size room nine lights and I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about old thousand watt fucking HPS lights
because I'm a dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine lights is probably the limit that I
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got like nine R specs in a room
that's going to be a killer fucking room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the amount of work that I
would expect one person to do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation in a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that it's going to get a little bit
crazy and a little bit hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scale up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial everything in before you add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it perfect before you add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to scrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Log everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to trellis everything
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to pop and twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial in your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial in the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get everything perfect before you expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then expand slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you've got two then go to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got four then go to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way that I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your light, your house can
handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I set up a grow in the summer it's
going to kick ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now in the winter it's going to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be different before you
scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a small grow in that room and get that
room figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that environment figured out for a
solid year before you scale up too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you might build a room that in the
winter it works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the summer comes it gets so hot
that you can't run it because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: add electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't add air conditioner because you
cannot add electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So build up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it run for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it run for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably my advice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fat it roundhouses your eyes shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit more recording here to do
than we are going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did give me flashbacks to my caregiver
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me sitting here reminiscing thinking
about some of the old school times in the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement when I had like 20 people down
there trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those were the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were they?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chukers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you once again for

the last episode.
