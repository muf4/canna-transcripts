[SPEAKER_00]: If you have ever had to dump the entire
reservoir because two drops of pH down was
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough, but three drops was way too
many, go ahead and click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grow From Your Heart podcast starts
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 817 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a fun show lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to announce that iRiDirect will
be back November 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been looking for iRiDirect,
have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website will be back November 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a lot of great items
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you join the mailing list at
iRigenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: When iRiDirect goes back online,
you will get a notification and update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you check out Patreon at
patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart because Patreon members do get first
dibs and first notifications when there
[SPEAKER_00]: are updates at iRiDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been asking what
happened to iRiDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I have to take down the website?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do a full podcast episode about why
I had to remove the website, about the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that happened and how I resolved
that and where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do a full podcast about that,
but I will probably put that on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be Patreon only content.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put that show out, when I do
complete that episode, I will let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is available, but the saga
continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is not completed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I have the website going again,
sales are back in action, things feel
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth, then I will talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make the full podcast about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built a good chronological timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping an outline of how it happened,
the timeline of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about it all very soon,
but it will be a Patreon episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know when that's coming so
that you can join the Patreon and check
[SPEAKER_00]: out that story if you are at all
interested in the story of why iRiDirect
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared and the triumphant return of
iRiDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough rambling here at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into everybody's favorite
portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the email portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need grow help, if you have grow
questions, please go to my website
[SPEAKER_00]: iRiGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a grow help tab at the top of the
page or a tab that says questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some work to the website on
the website so things will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may say grow help, but it may say
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use whichever one pops up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the question tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what's going on in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do read your grow question here on
the podcast, you will win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: iRiGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, you'll get a free pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me those questions on iRiGenetics
.com or of course iRiDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will win free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question to be read on today's
podcast came from somebody who wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: call themselves Stefan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message,
Stefan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, what's up,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope that you are well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for the interesting topics
that help us understand this plant better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing and thank you for
contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say I've got some general
questions regarding fox tailing flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hope to get an explanation from a
pro other than the bro science you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to be completely honest with you
here, my dude, this is going to be bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're asking about, I don't have any
scientific knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do any real research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just what I've experienced with
playing with genetics, playing with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants and what I think a lot of this
is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll jump into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, why does fox tailing
happen at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way to avoid it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there even a need for it other than
avoiding the annoying extra labor when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to trimming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot and please keep up the great
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for encouraging me to keep
up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have skipped a couple of weeks of
episodes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing shows every other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been spending a lot of energy getting
irie direct going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's been very time consuming,
very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little bit stressful to tell
you the truth and I've dedicated more time
[SPEAKER_00]: to that than I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I should have been here doing the
podcast, but I put more energy into irie
[SPEAKER_00]: direct needed to get that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here now doing a podcast, but thank
you to all of the people who, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: when an episode does not come out,
people like immediately like, Hey bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is are you all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your life okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everything good?
[SPEAKER_00]: People check on me when episodes don't
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump to everyone who checks on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I will not stop doing the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do need to skip a week,
take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, life gets busy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been enjoying life and doing
those things, uh, but have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me answer this question and quit
rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause I am quite rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking some, uh, it's a Mai Tai
to, uh, it's actually called Mai Tai to
[SPEAKER_00]: pussy cake from Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's an amazing dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, um, the Fox tailing, why does it
happen at all happen at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, uh, that is just basically a
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that plant is going to Fox tail,
uh, no matter where you put it,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what environment that plant goes
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me talk about Fox tailing in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when we grow a plant,
it makes a little like a pine cone shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll make a fingery looking bud
with weird finger shapes coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird stacked calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that is less or more exaggerated
depending on the plant and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are your Fox tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't like those like this
grower said because it is extra work when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a pain in the ass to work around
and they're not super pretty in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what causes that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying a moment ago, most of the
time that Fox tailing, a lot of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many genetics will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the more tropical sativa type
stuff will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most of your Afghans and your Indica
stuff won't do it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I believe that is so, uh,
so that that plant, it is hot and tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: and humid where that plant is being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it got tight and clustery,
that inside part would get moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant knew that and it went,
Hey, let's spread out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got all this breathing room so it
doesn't get moldy in the inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think Fox tailing is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be exaggerated by room environment
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it gets too hot, that will bring
on more Fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too dry, that could encourage
Fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if it gets too humid, that could
encourage Fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what happens in the
environment and how that plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically programmed to respond to that
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is Fox tailing a good or bad thing is
the next part of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is a very relative question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for flower, if you want
a nice, uh, bag appeal, if you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: sack, like Dr. Dre taught us a long time
ago, you want a sack of rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a bag of tight, dense buds that
just lines the bottom of the baggie would
[SPEAKER_00]: be your quarter of nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all that should be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dense, tight rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is a good mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're rolling blunts, if you're taking
bong loads, but if you are a concentrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate maker, some of these finger,
uh, fingery Fox tailing buds are more
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I were to take my fist and I
were to roll it around in powdered sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to moisten up my fist and roll
it in powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get this much surface area
worth of powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, imagine if that is trichomes on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got this much trichome all over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to measure that,
but this much surface area covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine if we grew a more open,
structured bud, a more Fox tailing bud
[SPEAKER_00]: that was like this and had weird shapes
coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all that extra surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just opened up for more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're making concentrates, that would
be much easier to extract from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That more fingery, airier, more spacious,
open type of a bud is more desirable for a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see a trend starting that the
concentrate makers are realizing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower smokers want that tighter bud,
that tighter bud structure, which we all
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy, which is popular, which we're all
accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it,
but the people that are making
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, they're leaning more toward
the phenotypes that are more open,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more airy, because like I just
talked about, there's more, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: more, uh, surface area to get trichomes
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, uh, if you got this bud with
just this much trichome in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this inside, it's hard to wash that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to extract that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bud is much easier to, however you're
pressing it, extracting it, washing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: blasting it, processing it, whatever you
do, this bud is easier to knock trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is a pro and a con of that Fox
Taili bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for bag appeal,
if you want to put it on the shelf at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, if you want the crew to buy it
and pay top dollar for it, maybe that Fox
[SPEAKER_00]: Taili shit's not for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're making concentrates,
that just may be the perfect strain for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the future, I do see a trend in
those Fox Taili strains getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular for the concentrate makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you're running bubble bags,
you got all those fingers, that's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to wash than a tight bunch of
rocks, in my opinion, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let me make sure I've covered
this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did ramble quite a long time about that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Tailing, does it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way to avoid it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that Fox Tailing is genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is brought on by too much
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting a lot of excessive Fox
Tailing, maybe raise your lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: get that bud away from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe cool off the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a need for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the concentrate makers like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra labor when it comes to trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you're making concentrates,
you don't have to trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all about phenotypical selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pick the one that is not so fingery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me, my voice is burning out
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my friend Stefan, thank you for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I read your message here on the
podcast, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You, my dude, won a free pack of
iRegenetics Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me an email with your real
name and a good, safe shipping address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the subject of that email,
please put prizes so that I know to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, so that I know to send you
prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else out there, if you're
expecting prizes, send me a reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the word prizes in the subject line of
the email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will get, or in the, yeah,
the subject line of the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will get your prizes out to you as
soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep the podcast moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Blue Grass
Ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Blue Grass Ganja?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I have recently
popped several tester packs from another
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been noticing on one of the seedlings
that it is showing variegation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is when you see just different,
like it'll probably be dark green and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see some light green coloring,
maybe tiger stripes, maybe stripes going
[SPEAKER_00]: up the length or the width of the plant of
the leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basic variegation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe an albino looking leaf or something
on there or a half albino leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basic variegation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, would you be concerned and what
are the possible outcomes from finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon to see some weird
things in little tiny plants in seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: that are brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time, the plant will simply
grow out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variegation, it may grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird mutations when the plants are
little, it may grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, then you've got a really
unique plant that I would flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep a clone of it and I would see
what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's super fire and it grows good and
smokes good, gets you good and buzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a nice flavor to it, and it makes some
cool variegation, that may be something
[SPEAKER_00]: fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep an eye on it, make sure it
doesn't do anything super weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would just keep growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat it like normal, but keep an eye on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts doing weird shit,
then make some decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your options right now are that it's
going to grow out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it's a foot tall, you'll never
even remember that it had a variegation or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to stay just like it was or it
will exaggerate the variegation,
[SPEAKER_00]: at which point I would make some
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a picture at that point,
then we can make some decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this little seedling stage,
it's very likely that it will grow out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of my plants, some of my favorite
plants are the weirdos that grew from a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weirdos, the misfits, the runs that
most of you would have thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those might be some of the best plants in
the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you think about it,
they're doing weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're just going to bang out a
whole bunch of THC as another weird treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what those weirdos could
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes give them a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a quick answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Blue Grass Ganja, since I did
read your question here on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means you, my friend, win a free pack
of iRegenetics Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, please do send me your
shipping address.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you send me those shipping
addresses, you guys, gals, and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in between, please send me a real shipping
address with a real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The post office knows your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who gets mail there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are seeds that are fully legal and
legit to send.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me your real name and real address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get you seed safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, my dude Blue Grass Ganja,
thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to the follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what happens with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets crazier, if it grows right on
out of it, if you decide to cull it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you decide to keep it going,
if you decide to breed with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know because I'm very curious about
your variegated plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this party moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Tokamak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend Tokamak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, send me your shipping address
because you won a free pack of iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tokamak has a question and it goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is a breeding question about
S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk about S1 before we
get too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is an S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that you've got a Golden
Goat female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take that Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut two clones of the same plant,
that Golden Goat and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to treat one plant with a
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That solution will cause this plant to
create pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen will be put on the other
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have just made Golden Goat S1
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will be all female,
all Golden Goat seeds because we used a
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat female and a Golden Goat
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bred them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all Golden Goat S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: S stands for self.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the first generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first generation of selfed
Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just using the Golden Goat as an
example here because that makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move forward with the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says when crossing an S1 with a male of
a different cultivar and hunting the
[SPEAKER_00]: results to find a keeper, female,
what would be the purpose of backcrossing
[SPEAKER_00]: the keeper to the original S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to explain this, I'm going to stick
with the Golden Goat theory because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of done this with Golden Goat and I
can explain how and why and what my
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose was and what the purpose could be
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to take a Golden Goat S1 and
you want to pollinate that with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I didn't do exactly this with the
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make it as a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did this, I used the original
Golden Goat clone because I have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't have that original
Golden Goat clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the S1 seed and this example
he's asking about the S1 seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the story we're going to change my
Golden Goat to the S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for history's sake, I've got the
original Golden Goat clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get it twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think I'm saying something different
than ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just changing the story for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with the Golden Goat
S1 seed and then when we're going to cross
[SPEAKER_00]: the Golden Goat S1 with the male of a
different cultivar, we're going to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker because hypothetically,
realistically, that's kind of what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Golden Goat and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I took that male of a different
cultivar like in this question and I
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated that S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the real world, I did the clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep saying, I want to make that
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this story, took the Daybreaker
male, pollinated that S1 Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have made a rise for this
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, also out of that arise did come a
very good a couple of male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one male known as King Solomon,
but also there's the lesser known male
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the Golden Goat dominant male of
the arise batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one that I used to make the
Golden Goat back cross seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about what would be the
purpose of back crossing the keeper to the
[SPEAKER_00]: original S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I'm talking about here is going
to be a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll touch on what the actual
question is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I did was I found a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is asking about finding a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male because we took a male
plant and pollinated a fem seed that made
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female plants out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found a male that really spoke to me
that looked just like the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my purpose for back crossing that was
because I wanted to stabilize those Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat traits and make Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no pure Golden Goat regular
seeds and a lot of purists do not want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy the feminized version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are just not into feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an array of reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about that now,
but some people don't want to buy fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want original Golden Goat
back cross seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated it with Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have now got seeds that are half Golden
Goat, half Daybreaker because parents were
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of one, one of one on one side,
one on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I searched for a phenotype, a male that
looked a lot like the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of the phenotypes looked like the
Daybreaker, I eliminated those for this
[SPEAKER_00]: project because I don't want Daybreaker
traits in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next step, if I want Golden Goat,
if I want Golden Goat back cross seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to essentially wash out all of the
Daybreaker traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking for a male that does not
look like Daybreaker at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a boy that looks exactly like
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took that dude and I pollinated the
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine was, like I said, the original Golden
Goat clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this story, I would pollinate that
original S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose for that is now I'm washing
out some of those Daybreaker traits
[SPEAKER_00]: because now it's more of a two to one mix
of that Golden Goat, Golden Goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker combination because I kind of
washed out some of that Daybreaker by
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding it back to the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe I did really good thinking and
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very meticulous in my selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taking leaves off of my Golden Goat
female and leaves off of my potential
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat male candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And matching them up to see if leaf shape
and size and serration were even.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was rubbing one with one hand and one
with the other and making sure the smells
[SPEAKER_00]: were the same throughout the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very meticulous with selecting my
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an Arise Golden Goat dominant looking
phenotype of Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very specific in selecting that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my phenotypes in my Golden Goat
back cross come out very, very Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back cross too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I did it again, if I grew those back
cross one seeds and found a male plant out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that and put that back on the Golden
Goat again, it would really lock in those
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those seeds would be Golden Goat,
just straight Golden Goat coming out when
[SPEAKER_00]: they grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose for my reason for going
backwards was to wash out the Daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and lock in the Golden Goat traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was removing the plant that I used to
adulterate it to initiate the back cross
[SPEAKER_00]: process because at the time there was no
Golden Goat male.
[SPEAKER_00]: There still is no Golden Goat male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people want those pure Golden Goat
non-feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest I can get is a back cross or a
back cross two version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about why I chose the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the back cross to lock in
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are saying, what if I were to back
cross the keeper to the original S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to find a female keeper
out of here and cross it to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would essentially do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would lock in whatever traits you have
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would really lock in those traits to
where you found them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 70 to 80% of the seeds you grew
would look just like the original plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've started with if you did your
selections properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I read that correctly, you want to
take your S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all makes sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still got the S1 over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to find a good female out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then which one are we going to reverse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to reverse the new female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what would be the purpose of
back crossing the original to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: or the new one to the original?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do we want to reverse?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way you do it, I would reverse
the original and put it on the new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do both, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd fuck around and do both over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, you're just locking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find that keeper and then you find
that golden goat, you're just putting in
[SPEAKER_00]: that original S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just locking in those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you selected the one you really
love, and then you can lock in those
[SPEAKER_00]: traits in the next breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the purpose, is to lock in
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to open anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to create anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some transgressive segregation
or some weird recessive traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the main purpose would be to lock in
dominant traits which you have identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're talking about it,
this is sort of what I did with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog and number 77, kind of on
accident without even realizing what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is another story for another
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody remind me, because I'm not going
to write it down, to do an episode about
[SPEAKER_00]: number 77 and the Grateful Dog,
and we'll talk more in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Taco Mac, I think I've
answered your question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of rambling about this,
and I'm not even sure that I got you a
[SPEAKER_00]: solid answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder to breeder, I think you'll
understand all the stuff that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, make sure you do send
me your shipping address, because I owe
[SPEAKER_00]: you a free pack of iReGenetics premium
seeds, and I look forward to seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: you do with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you are a breeder, somebody starting
thinking about breeding, I do encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: you and give you my blessings and
permission to breed with any seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: you receive from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get iReGenetics premium seeds,
regular feminized seeds, any seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: come from me, you do have my permission
and blessings to breed with them if you
[SPEAKER_00]: got them in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stole them or scammed someone or
ripped them off, throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't deserve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you got them in a positive,
what is it, an ethical way, grow the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of those, breed them, produce some
quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you give me credit on the
breeding package or when you put them out
[SPEAKER_00]: or when you share them, I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a stickler about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed, breed, free love, grow the ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is all I think I've got
for you for this episode.
