[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of melon smash
live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Tangelope and Dayrecker
BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
melons and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crack open the jar, it is
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hint of strawberries coming out
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I take a dab, I am greeted with
that fuel flavor on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very pleasant buzz on the back
of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it contains 67.15% total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the melon smash live
batter for keeping me happily medicated
[SPEAKER_00]: through this podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: Where else can we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all my friends who support us on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else, what else, where do we go from
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new shirts available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on YouTube,
you can see I'm rocking this fresh new,
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics, lemon, Jeffrey shirts is
I read genetics on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the lemon, Jeffrey logo on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say I read genetics, but it is not
a blatantly cannabis themed t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for some fresh new gear,
you can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is being rebuilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the people who were
rebuilding my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is under construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the new site, I read genetics.com
should be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about four weeks from today,
I will let you know when that's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, we are selling the shirts
on my Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is I read gifts, LLC on Etsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search I read gifts, LLC on Etsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find I read genetics,
lemon, Jeffrey shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let me do a quick reach over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find these beautiful orange gasm
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding one up for the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the orange gasm logo on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not blatantly cannabis,
but it does say I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of those people who wants to
support but can't wear a weed themed
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt, this may be something for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding that up for the camera so they can
get a nice clear view, nice bright vivid
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, nice artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend Kevin Hartman for
the great art and shout out to the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who made the shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, grab yourself some shirts on the
Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read gifts, LLC on Etsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a lemon, Jeffrey and an
orange gasm shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
there may be golden goat shirts available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, check back very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are due the same day that this
podcast is due.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will inspect them, make sure they
printed them well, make sure they're
[SPEAKER_00]: quality shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they pass my inspection,
kapow, they go up there onto the Etsy
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably by the time this episode airs,
if not 24 hours from the time this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out, we will have golden goat
t-shirts available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've covered a lot of business
and a lot of ground here at the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the Patreon part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it is time to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the message portion of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a long time listener,
someone who interacts with me quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he didn't want to send a message
because he's been bugging me a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never bugging me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep sending the questions and responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are never bugging me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the cannabis questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the community interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it takes me a minute to reply,
I'm not ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a hundred new messages in my
inbox and I got to find you, but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the messages coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, please don't use
my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot when people tell me not
to use their real name makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who gets a shout out from this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know not to use your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been meaning to write to you
since episode 560 to tell you how much I
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed hearing you and Mike drop stories
and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You two just bullshitting provided so much
information that people like me would
[SPEAKER_00]: never hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made 560 a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thinks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fun episode to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really went off the rails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be really had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just two dudes hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says my incentive to write was
increased because I have a question about
[SPEAKER_00]: something that just happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some firsthand experience,
inspiring questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mention the breeder or the
seed bank involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very classy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have edited that out anyway,
but I like your approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I ordered a particular strain from
a seed bank, which I am sure you are
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with, but does not carry I read
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my habit is to grow one seed out
to learn the plant before I grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd put this and an orange gasm in a
flower tent at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were two of the they were the two
prettiest girls in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were two and one half weeks
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pulled them out of the tent to give
them a close visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we are is this listener bought
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought a pack of seeds from a vendor
that does not carry I read genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to grow more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I want you to buy my seeds and
grow them, but there are so many things
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stick with just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also you'll see where things
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend bought some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also bought some orange gasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow one seed from a pack at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they've got an orange gasm seed
growing and they've got this other seed
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, which we're not going to name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are how are we one and two and one
half weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taken his plants out of the tent to
take a look just like we're supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already know how this is going to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you've probably guessed by now
that I found male pollen sacks growing
[SPEAKER_00]: alongside female flowers on the plant in
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant that is not the orange gasm
is showing female flowers on one plant on
[SPEAKER_00]: one bud and male flowers on another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an intersex plant here to
showing us two different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the orange gasm was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the orange gasm hasn't shown you any
intersex or hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still flowering as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says thankfully no pollen has been
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pollen that you know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too excited yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fuckers go more quickly than we
think sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to fucking burst your bubble,
but hopefully I'm really hoping you got in
[SPEAKER_00]: there early enough that they go sooner
than we expect sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it's tough to commit Caniside,
but that guy gal had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, get those the fuck out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel bad at all about committing
plant Caniside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking for professional athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for high level fucking
Olympic athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one was not performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It couldn't even run around the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an elite club and we are very
selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid to admit that I fucking
choose favorites in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to do that with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do it with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder in question had online reviews
indicating problems with hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I contacted the seed bank and after
much wrangling, I got some relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very lucky there because a lot of
the seed banks, if you say you germinated
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds, they're going to tell you that
those were meant as souvenirs and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't germinate them anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fucked up by germinating them and
now you're shit out of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're lucky you got anywhere with that
seed bank, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, however, the seed bank blamed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait to see exactly what the seller
does before I decide if I'm satisfied with
[SPEAKER_00]: its response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Needless to say, I won't grow any more
seeds from that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely that company is going to blow
you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did send me details about where this
came from that I left out of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not going to reply to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to do shit for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my assumption, in my experience,
they're going to tell you that it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: your fault to have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may give you a coupon or something
for more seeds, but I don't think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be satisfied with the fix here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend seedsherenow.com
100% satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a satisfaction guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If seeds go wrong that you buy at Seeds
Here Now, you send them a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, hey, these seeds didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will let me know that they had
to replace them and then I replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only person, I cover my mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your seeds don't work, I cover them to
the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed bank covers you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how customer service should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know if you ever got a problem
with iRegenetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email iregenetics at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't troll me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be polite about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think you're shit out of luck
with those seeds that you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, you were a guy that runs one
seed at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people run the whole pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have been a 10 pack or a 12
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you run 12 of them and found 12
herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have had 12 times the soil,
water, nutrients, space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been compounded by 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of glad you were a guy that
runs one at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you got one intersex plant out of
that batch, so far they are 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine what's going to come
from the other 10 or 12 or maybe six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were FEMS, that company sells
packs of six FEMS, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would have had five more
problematic plants on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get myself back on track or this
podcast is going to end up being like 44
[SPEAKER_00]: days long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so here is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pollen sacs were what I would call
genetic herms as opposed to stress herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's calling them genetic
hermaphrodites and not stress
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, those labels indicate that
this is kind of a weird boundary to cross
[SPEAKER_00]: here, kind of a fine line to dance on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's saying that he assumes some
plants are more genetically prone and
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly selected to be herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are just triggered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That trait was lying in that plant and it
would have been brought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to get to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just keep talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, am I correct that if pollen sacs
develop on a plant side by side with
[SPEAKER_00]: female flowers, that the trait is within
the genetics of the strain and not a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: While I did have less than a week of
slightly higher tent temperatures during a
[SPEAKER_00]: short heat wave, conditions in the tent
were pretty normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain the process of
hermaphroditism in cannabis, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between what causes male-female
parts on the same node and what causes
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers to sprout from flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the benefit of your expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I am an expert in the
category of hermaphroditism or intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see that, I get rid of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do understand what you were asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you will see a plant later in
flower start throwing, we call them
[SPEAKER_00]: nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just single male flowers that pop
up in the middle of a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are more from stressing a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more from problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when your plant produced these
male flowers early into flower like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is a hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds that were poorly selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did reply to our friend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did sign it from used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signed it with used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just showed your name on the screen,
I will block that out because I held up
[SPEAKER_00]: your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did reply to used to be cool and I said,
hey, I think both of those examples are
[SPEAKER_00]: predetermined traits in the plant,
a lot like color and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hermaphroditism is a trait within
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a trait just like the smell of the
plant, just like the growth, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really good with PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not also maybe it's got
intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an alial, which this plant
carries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, we provide the environmental
situation to trigger that expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant held that intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to give it the environment to bring
that intersex trait out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a lot of times you can make some
plants turn cold or turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get them cold, that's a trait we
can bring out through environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density is a lot determined by
environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get airy buds or we can get dense
buds from the same plant based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are giving it the situation to
express different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put you, I'm trying to think of
different situations I can put you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put you near a bunch of junk food all
the time and make you watch crap TV,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to turn into a junk food
eating, crap minded person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I give you health food and healthy
things to do all day, you'll become a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy person who's physically fit with a
strong, healthy mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a product of your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how you express your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to stay on track and also give
good examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants were given the environment
to show hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting off track of what I wrote
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going with what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a breeder should be testing his
seeds before releasing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you got was poor breeding and
untested seeds that were prone to intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poorly selected parent stock for femmes
will make hermaphroditic offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the word I wrote here,
but it says plants that flip from major
[SPEAKER_00]: stress are more common because cannabis
wants to survive and will reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you leave most cannabis plants
growing for too long, they will find a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start throwing off very few
hermaphroditic male flowers or male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, not even hermaphroditic flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start throwing those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of this plant is nobody's going
to pick me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to pollinate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fucking self pollinate myself so I
can survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cannabis is whole goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to make seeds so it can grow
again next year so it can make seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to get myself back
where I was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that hint of hermaphroditism is in a
lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders should be selecting plants more
carefully to where we don't have such
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood for hermaphroditism in the
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what this guy got, what used to be
cool got was just poorly bred,
[SPEAKER_00]: untested, untried and true genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These genetics should have been test
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they showed hermaphroditism,
if they showed intersex traits two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half weeks into flower like that,
the breeder should have seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of yours did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of yours did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a few of his had to have done
it and he should have seen that and he
[SPEAKER_00]: should have said, these are shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not sell these to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to grow these myself and find some
gems or give them to my friends and warn
[SPEAKER_00]: them that these are bullshit, but they
should not have gone to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: No vendor, no retailer should have ever
gotten their hands on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was poor practices, bad customer
service, bad selection, bad ethics,
[SPEAKER_00]: bad breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucked up is what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should have been removed from the
gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this guy's passing on hermaphroditic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people are going to buy these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to spend money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting way off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, balls and pistols on the same
branch show obvious intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few nanners and a mostly looking female
is more likely a grower issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're causing the plants a
hermaphrodite and it's just spitting out a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of male flowers, that is probably a
light leak, some sort of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's showing straight up balls and
female flowers on the same plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a poorly selected breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been scrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wrapped my message up with I'm high
as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you guys I'm answering messages
at three in the morning and I am high as
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mainly that should have been found in
test batches and you should not have been
[SPEAKER_00]: sold those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of that hermaphroditism
was your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you've got another plant in there,
the orangegasm didn't show you any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an indicator that that was a
problem with the genetics and not your
[SPEAKER_00]: fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I rambled right through your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you some useful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the interaction
with you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to hearing your reply
to my reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a screenshot in my phone from
another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me a message on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if this came from YouTube
or cannabis, but my phone will tell me if
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit stumbling and get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from cannabis and it says,
Hey, Rasta Jeff, I just discovered your
[SPEAKER_00]: show via the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the Dude Grow
Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our new friend found us through the Dude
Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for finding me from the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you mentioned you are limited to a
low plant count at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plant count here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a six plant per person cap for
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do have a medical cannabis
card, which allows me six more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm now allowed 12 plants in my
personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm allowed to have because of
the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does limit me very low to
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 12 plants I'm allowed to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes on and says, could you talk
about the logistics of breeding at home
[SPEAKER_00]: with a low plant count?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is something I could definitely
elaborate on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between breeding and a
bigger facility and breeding at a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is definitely smaller batches,
smaller scales, which means more focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only allowed 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really want to think about it,
how many mom plants do I keep?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how many plants do I put in the
veg room?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I need a male plant also,
or how many plants do I put into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got mother plants, veg plants,
flower plants, and a male plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully backups or clones of
whatever I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to be really, really selective
of what I'm using and what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with and what makes and doesn't make
the cut to stay in my stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to breed on a very small
plant, very small scale because of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: counts, you need to focus on your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have any plants that aren't
winners, aren't champions, aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: potential breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have nothing but winners in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's use my 12 plant state
legal count to do a little breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of options when it
comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to breed one plant to one
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to breed one male plant to a
bunch of female plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to breed a reversed female to
other females?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your ultimate goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a lot of the decisions
making when it comes to logistics of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I run a commercial seed breeding
company, I like to make multiple strains
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually put King Solomon,
my popular male, in the room with several
[SPEAKER_00]: females so that he can hit the strawberry
fields, the platinum tangy, the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, and then we can make,
what do we make there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a sun kiss, we make strawberry
fields, and we make blue raspberry truffle
[SPEAKER_00]: out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the grateful dog in there so we
can make morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a rise female in there so we can
make a rise F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe when you're not looking,
I'll sneak something brand new in there so
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make a brand new cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a bunch of the old trusty
reliable stuff to restock the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also I've got a brand new thing to
send out to my testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can build more hype, keep stuff going
while I'm doing productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I make commercial production,
I'm putting a male in there with five or
[SPEAKER_00]: six tried and true females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That boy hits those girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I make a batch of five or six
different crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I harvest those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I have to think about is I've
got a certain amount of mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which genetics I want to keep,
so I select a few of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are now eating up part of my
plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So King Solomon is always around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always eating up part of my plant
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry fields, what is the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum tangy, blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are eating up part of my plant
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to get cloned off of,
or they're going to get dragged into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room with the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my issue is I need to keep those
plants around because I want to breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: them again in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got to take a clone of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those clones are starting to eat up my
plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've got to do is carefully think
about how many mother plants I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep, how many plants I'm going to throw
into the breeding room, then how I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep clones of those to keep them for
preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really nice balance and a really
nice juggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I do have other places where I
can store mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends that I can rely on that
will keep genetics for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just got a mother plant of certain
things where if I want to breed with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call them up and I say,
Hey, I'm going to need six clones of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in this many days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get them going for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take 12 clones and I go pick my
favorite six and they get to run the other
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we make sure that genetics
stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some really trustworthy friends
who have got some really good genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking stashed away for me, or I wouldn't
be able to do a lot of the projects that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be able to keep your
mother plants, you've got to have veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that will eventually become flower
plants, and you need clones to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is you can
re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the numbers,
you can re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to sound crazy to a new
breeder, but this is something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a plant, I put it into flower for
18 days and I pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let that fucker sit for about five days
with pollen in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put it back into the veg room under
18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My plant is pregnant and now I'm putting
it back in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly over time, that plant went back
into a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the seeds inside of that plant kept
maturing because that plant didn't care if
[SPEAKER_00]: it was in flower or if it was in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already pregnant and it was going
to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plant is in the veg room making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: About six or seven weeks into that
process, I harvested all of the seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I did so, I left a bunch of those new
shoots that grew out because the plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: fully revegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just left those shoots that were
growing out and that plant is now
[SPEAKER_00]: completely in reveg and has given me fresh
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a plant into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved that plant back into a veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvested that plant for all of its
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is now a mother plant that has
been giving me clones, which are now back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the flower room being pollinated all
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to pollinate my plant,
harvest seeds from it, preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, and create more clones from the
same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this plant grows out big enough,
I will put it back in the flower room and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate it one more time because I've
got a clone from it and I've got a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that I've seeded that
plant multiple times and pulled harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: from it because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a way to preserve your
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main struggle I have is preserving my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep all of my plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like my babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're honestly my business and my
livelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep my eyes on them,
but I can't do it because I have to let my
[SPEAKER_00]: other trustworthy friends keep my veg
plants around for me, my mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: around because I don't have the legal
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a use for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I help them out in certain ways and
they help me out by keeping my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one way for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that low numbers really helps is
with focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were unlimited, my breeding would be
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the tight focus that it gives me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only allowed so many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps me really focused on having
nothing but elite winners in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is I have a hard time testing
because now I'm limited to so many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I keep six moms, I can run six
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to find the boys and the girls
out of those and call those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about pheno
hunting because if you're breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be pheno hunting to find
the keepers from your crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to do large pheno
hunts, but when you're minimizing your own
plant count, you're going to be running 10
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not recognized by legal plant
counts, you can only run 12 at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's to stop you from running 10 right
now, picking the best and then running
[SPEAKER_00]: nine right next to it next time and pick
the best out of that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the one from before or a new one,
just keep picking the best one every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the alpha fucking female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run 10 more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run nine more seeds and that one next to
it and compare that one to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the best one out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it until you are satisfied and you know
that you have got the gem, the female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that for your male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you don't have to run large batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I said it that way,
but you don't have to run large batches
[SPEAKER_00]: and populations to pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're limited by numbers, you can do,
if you do 10, 10 seed pheno hunts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ran a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take you a little bit more
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take, but in that more time,
you're only paying attention to 10 plants
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really focus and pay attention to
each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, unlimited
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it hard to pay attention to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've got a hundred kids running
around, how do you remember all a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: of their names?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got 10 kids, you can remember all
10 of their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys, I feel like I need a
fucking dab mid show, but I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: press pause and take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you have got to manage how you keep
your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to focus and something that
will be really nice if you're trapped in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small grow is you won't get super huge
with all of your ideas and creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to focus in and make
further filial generations instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making new crops.
You can do that with a bunch of seeds,
but you can also do it with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a batch of seeds, keep the male and
female around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the rest of your count to plant
however many seeds you've got left.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a male plant and a female
plant, cross those, make seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your plant count is, you've got
two off your count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fill the rest of that count up with
seeds that you just made grow those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to breed again, find the best
male and the best female and keep those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now may be a time to decide if you want
the original male and female around,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it's time to get rid of them,
keep that new male and that new female,
[SPEAKER_00]: breed those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got the F twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got F twos to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fucking find the male and female
out of there and keep going and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of the old parents as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can add new shit to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you keep preservation of your
old genetics in a clone form or give them
[SPEAKER_00]: to your buddy or learn how to revedge,
you can continue your breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did say that I was going to talk
about my 12 plant breeding program and I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep getting sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus in a little bit on my 12 plant
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allowed to have six plants in flower
and six plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to get six plants that I know I'm
going to breed with from my friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: house my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put those into the flower room and I get
them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the male in there about 10 to 14
days before the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get him started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I move him away over to the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put the five females in there and I
get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's pollen time,
I shake that dude and I cut him down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got five in one room that
leaves me seven other plants to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got six in the veg room already
vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're about 30 days behind my flower
room so that every fucking 60 days I get
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean up the flower room, spray it
down, rebuild a little bit of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: put in new filters, put in new shit and
drag new plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never miss a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm on track, if I'm on cycle,
if things went according to plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes plants take a little bit longer
for the plants to harden up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got a new cross that I've been
playing with, I may have to wait a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks for that one plant to finish up
before I could put new plants back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, I've got half of the room
filled with plants that are pollinated and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got a veg room that is
filled with the other half of my plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count that are vegging out, getting popped
and twisted and cleaned up so that when it
[SPEAKER_00]: is flower time, they're nice and ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I harvest, I clean up,
make sure all the pollen is out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, put more plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get more veg plants and we
start growing them up about 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 days into that, depending on what I'm
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is just always have a plan,
always know where the next plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from, always have some clones
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wasn't blessed enough to have some
friends helping me out, I would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: have to reduce my plants to four plants in
the veg room, four in the mother room and
[SPEAKER_00]: four in flower, which would be my 12 plant
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would have dedicated mother plants,
I'd have three females and a male,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would take a clone off of those,
those would go into the veg room,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they would go into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always have four moms,
four veggies and four flowers is how I
[SPEAKER_00]: would work that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd have to be really strategic with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that I would have one boy plant
and three female plants to work with or
[SPEAKER_00]: four females, and I could just take turns
just reversing them and pollinating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However many combinations that would give
me, is that 16 or is that 32 or is it 64?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, dude, but there's some math
to be involved in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four times, four times, four,
it's four times the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of four times fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are way off track today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I am a commercial breeder and I'm
breeding for multiple strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a personal breeder and you're
just trying to breed for one project,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend having a male and maybe
one or two females to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of making a bunch of new crosses,
work on furthering that line, make that
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation all the way to like F5
or F6, where you can dial in the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another fun thing to do is work two lines,
work one line for smell, work one line for
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, work them both to about F4 or
five, and then breed those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get the potency and flavor
you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really fun way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the A line and the B line of two of
the same crosses, work them for different
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, and then breed those together in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something a lot of people are
overlooking and forgetting about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when breeding gets really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been rambling for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question about
small scale breeding at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly focus on keeping the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to breed that shit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have the genetics, then leave yourself
some room for veg plants and flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also you may need to eliminate
plants in the future so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sprout some of the seeds that you have
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a challenge testing your new
stuff, because we just want to sprout 100
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we start getting in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more questions,
I do look forward to hearing from you.
