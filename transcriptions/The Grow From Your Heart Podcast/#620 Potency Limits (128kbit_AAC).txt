[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 620.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Mike is here.

[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we might be, but the show would not
look this good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would still do it even without him,
but we wouldn't have the cool gear and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that fanciness happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd still look all rickety.

[SPEAKER_01]: I welcome to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, just in case people do want to stalk

[SPEAKER_01]: Also, all things that Mike says are

[SPEAKER_01]: Don't send me the emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to send me the hate mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say that and then I never get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Jeff does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where should they send that hate mail or
the great emails?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where should they send you the updates and
the greetings, Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hit me up on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can direct message either of those
accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Direct message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send him a DM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be nice to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: He volunteers to do this for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: He deals with two kids and a wife all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is his getaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be nice to my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we want to jump into too
much more else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could probably jump right into
the main topic of today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to notice that you've got
a boo-boo on your fingers if you've moved
[SPEAKER_01]: that hand towards the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took the boo-boo off to hide
the boo-boo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put that back on now that you've
added it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to make it a topic of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I broke a finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mike's got a boo-boo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We broke a finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a dog thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've addressed it and we've told him why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to keep a dog from getting hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog didn't bite me or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Rufus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a good boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mike for rescuing Rufus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have done the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have had a broken finger too if I
were in the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you did the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally thought, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to break your finger right
before I broke my finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listeners, if you ever think, don't do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to break a finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I advise you to not do that because you're
probably going to break a finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave me the option though of break
a finger or somebody's dog get hit by a
[SPEAKER_01]: car, I'll sacrifice my finger for almost
every dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have still reach out and help the
dog, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help the dog get your finger busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your finger will heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the dog would have gotten hurt
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's a big dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amusing and annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets to be amusing and annoying for six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've noticed about YouTube is if
there is a thing, somebody will address
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't, they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we don't have to answer the comments
because we already did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how social media and the
internet work now, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for way too long,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it jaded or programmed or just a where?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Professional, experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of professional and experienced,
we do have a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some shit to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got four, one, two, three,
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got five little bullet points here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got tabs open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's doing it real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep this going before we ruin the
appearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike told me they love it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sure do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use hashtag they like it when we ramble
when you talk about the podcast that helps
[SPEAKER_01]: us find the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's taking a rip off that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can get this out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has told me recently that there are
proposed potency limits in Colorado for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and concentrates and possibly
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't ask that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also failed to ask if this was for
recreational or for medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I figured that would be a great topic
for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't ask a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to save it all here and be fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to blow it all in the
hallway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are proposing making potency limits
on cannabis here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first question, of course, is this
medical or recreational cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposed bill would affect both med
and rec, so both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, this is just in Colorado,
but the people behind it are national or
[SPEAKER_02]: at least connected to a network of
national anti-cannabis organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one national org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one of their members runs their own
little state group.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually just five or six annoying
parents working together in concert on
[SPEAKER_02]: social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the last nine years, they've slowly
built a foothold of support in state
[SPEAKER_02]: legislatures, including Colorado's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now in Colorado, pardon if I wander
from the mic, I'm reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the language reads at the time of this
writing, which was February 17th of this
[SPEAKER_02]: year, we have a proposed bill that would
cap THC potency at 15% for both medical
[SPEAKER_02]: and recreational marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably for edibles, they're going to
leave that with the hundred milligram
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 package for med.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be higher, but anyway,
it's been so long since I bought a med
[SPEAKER_02]: edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll probably leave the med limits
alone for or the potency limits for
[SPEAKER_02]: edibles alone for now, but this would
apply to flowers and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that sounds insane to some of y'all,
there's some reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legislature, excuse me, tongue tied.
[SPEAKER_02]: The representative behind this bill,
and I'm going to butcher her name and I
[SPEAKER_02]: apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not intentional.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just bad at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Yadra Kaveo.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a Colorado representative from
Thornton.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the sponsor of the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also a pediatrician and her slant on
this is that high potency cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: products are bad for teenagers,
and so they shouldn't exist in the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: market in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their starting off point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, they've slowly built a
foothold in the legislature where this
[SPEAKER_02]: bill is instead of getting laughed out of
the door is slowly working its way through
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of becoming a bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the products aren't for teenagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that shouldn't even be a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're 18, you can shop medically
and there it's the think of the kid's
[SPEAKER_02]: angle is just what it's always been.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a ploy or a ruse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lawyer brain in me goes, well,
yeah, you don't want the teenagers to have
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't sell it to teenagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be 21 to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how we stop that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the dispensary shopping
legally under 18, you have two physicians
[SPEAKER_02]: monitoring your care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not willy nilly.
[SPEAKER_02]: A parent has to do all the shopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very regulated in Colorado,
more regulated than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the anti pot groups, maybe four years
ago, realized that they didn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: prayer of getting a repeal passed through
the vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way that the voters are going
to vote out marijuana once it's been voted
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going anywhere with all the money
it makes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two years ago, I think they tried to do
a ballot measure that would do the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, cap potency at 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their ballot measure went nowhere because
one of the marijuana industry groups in
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver hired the two or three signature
gathering firms in Colorado and just said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're busy now.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they call, don't answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your finders fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the end of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 15% potency bill that was going to go
through the ballot system like
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dirty politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's playing dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say how much I like that
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is playing dirty, but I like that our
side's playing dirty considering these
[SPEAKER_02]: laws were playing dirty to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there were never a bunch of doctors
that were like, Hey, this is hurting
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should make it harder to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always politicians going,
you know, life would be easier if poor and
[SPEAKER_02]: brown people couldn't vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we make the stuff that they
like to do when they're off hours illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: and we can just arrest them and make them
felons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we don't ever have to count their
votes again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we did that two years ago,
I thought that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would have preferred a good,
good old fashioned shellacking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked that they were completely
thwarted by having to be grassroots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they can't hire people to do the
signature gathering, that means they would
[SPEAKER_02]: have to have a broad base of support
willing to do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this happens all the time in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be harder in other places,
but we have at least one active recall
[SPEAKER_02]: effort going all the time where a group of
people is trying to oust a politician or
[SPEAKER_02]: change the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so signature gathering is pretty
common here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could have been done if they had
support and they didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found a representative from
Thornton to sponsor the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to keep it a secret in a
draft got left in a copy or somewhere or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got outed about three months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then there's been some reporting on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill wants to do some other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's wants to create a medical
marijuana monitoring program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So patients purchases are tracked in a
statewide system to try to limit looping
[SPEAKER_02]: They want better tracking of the patient
doctor relationship so that they can make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that the doctor that signed your
medical marijuana card is really
[SPEAKER_02]: monitoring your progress and your health
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want data collection to track the
effects of high potency THC products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seeks to protect public health through
potency limits and the prohibition of
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous products used by underage youth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they just want to be all up in my
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fucking adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already got a medical marijuana card
from my doctor who approves and there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: reason for anybody else to step in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite things about
medical cannabis is that I can dose myself
[SPEAKER_01]: without I know I'm not going to kill
myself so I could dose myself if it still
[SPEAKER_01]: hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could take more if it doesn't hurt so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to take as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need somebody involved that
doesn't know what the fuck they're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about in my medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like a number of other medicines
that we have in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a little weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is the only medicine in my house
that's locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a bunch of medicines in my
house that will harm my kids if my kids
[SPEAKER_02]: eat the whole container.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the cannabis if that were to
happen, it just be sleepy time for quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd probably face way more legal
problems if they ate your cannabis than if
[SPEAKER_01]: they ate the bottle of bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really unfortunate that the laws are
still as screwed up as they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially around this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's basically nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different facets of why
this is horseshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they say they picked the 15% number
because that's where other countries have
[SPEAKER_02]: found bad effects on cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a myth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've had hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since prehistory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know through modern testing that like
hand rub hash, old school hash that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: around since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sieve hash that's been around since
the I mean, I said the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around a hell of a lot longer
than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when it got popular again in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: in popular culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these forms of hash are like 30 to 60
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been true the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If making cannabis products more pure led
to more negative outcomes, we would have
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed a long fucking time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I would be displaying it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or during the clinical trials for Marinal
or its knockoffs, we would have found
[SPEAKER_02]: something other than what we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've all been around people that
consume too much cannabis and got a little
[SPEAKER_02]: too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh, buddy, you need a
Snickers and like a chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a Gatorade and a burrito.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's your prescription to get
better from your weed overdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a little bit of a nap and you'll be
just fine.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe first timers who way overdo
it like still high at breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like a lot of that's just because
you're in a better mood and you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: world better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to eat edibles to still be high at
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like they're 15 percent number they're
picking is trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to pretend that that's where
cannabis gets dangerous, because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the number Britain randomly picked like 30
years ago to different or to differentiate
[SPEAKER_02]: between regular cannabis and what they
call skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Netherlands followed suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, there's a potency cap where in
the Dutch market, cannabis isn't legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just overly tolerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overly is the wrong word, but highly
tolerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it is certain THC percentage in
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the Dutch government officially
considers cannabis worth caring about
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's been misconstrued by
prohibitionist in the States is that's
[SPEAKER_02]: when the cannabis gets dangerous is when
it's over 15 or 16 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a medical patient,
don't you need potent medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are and I'm just asking not
necessarily, but yeah, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: good reasons to have potent medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you rather me take if I were sick
and elderly, would you rather me take 17
[SPEAKER_01]: inhalations off of a shitty product or two
dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two ends and outs of breathing to
get the medication I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to consume less.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to consume more if it's a
lesser quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to consume more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're talking about monitoring
and limiting our purchasing even further,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have to this is going to
drive me back to the black market is what
[SPEAKER_01]: this will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how much I buy every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go I buy my limit probably two times a
week when it comes to concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what day my favorite dispensary
gets a drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to you guys over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say your name, but I don't want
more people cleaning you out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're not getting shut out
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go there and I get my concentrates
about twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get my limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I'm ready to go back,
I'm close to running out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they restrict my limit of purchases,
that's going to fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they restrict the potency, they would
be cutting my potency in essentially a
[SPEAKER_01]: third.
[SPEAKER_02]: No less than what's and that's not even
the tip of why this bill is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it'll be super annoying for you and
me because we'll have to consume a much
[SPEAKER_02]: higher volume of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be getting one fifth of the potency on
this jar if it were limited to 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not just like what's the other
85% now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what led to the vaping crisis last
year, the year before last in 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, 2020 still seems like five years in
my head.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in 2019, there was a big vaping crisis
coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took a while for us to really shake
out the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once we did, we found that it's
additives to THC in cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's shitty cartridges and shitty
additives that were causing the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were consuming those two things
because they wanted the THC, which doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: harm anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the additives that they now want
us to make up 85% of our extracts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how am I going to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't grow flowers that are 15% or
lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the real reason they picked 15
is because it would gut the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know they can't vote us away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're hoping to make a rule that
it's impossible to meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole industry would have to re-breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like a paint color.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't be like, oh, there's too much
blue in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a little more white in and tone it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't spray something on it to bring
the THC percentage down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do what they do with the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could just take the whole plant and
put it in the University of Mississippi
[SPEAKER_02]: and put the whole plant through a blender
and call that final product, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brag about being able to provide any
THC content you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, they take their trash and
clean it up until it's just hash if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Colorado, we've been breeding for
THC for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say since the fucking
sixties, probably that's because we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know about the secondary cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted to get high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have lab tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the problems of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You aren't smoking the weed anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired of lab tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Machines aren't smoking the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do for people?
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know what we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, until they really discovered THC
and really figured out a lot about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just marijuana is fun and we're not
sure why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was, Oh, it's because of the
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't get to even thinking about
the other stuff until medical had already
[SPEAKER_02]: been around the country for a decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this point to try to re-breed an
entire genetic line across the state down
[SPEAKER_02]: to below 15% flower, it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take two or three years of trial
and error in cross-breeding the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they make us take a two year
non-profitable, we have to completely time
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the labs will do us the same
favor that they probably do for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people and just mark this as 12 instead of
32?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that the labs do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody says those labs cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I don't know who to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent so much product to the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly look into this camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never paid the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never paid for a good lab test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some of the highest lab tests in
the country and we've never paid for a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't know who the fuck to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to, they bill us for our time and
shit, but I don't know who to pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: higher numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys quit saying that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple of labs that tried it
right at the start before we had rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: because before we had rules, people were
asking for labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so labs started to crop up and it was
about then that the state was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait, they have what now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean a lab like a crack house?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, no, like a testing lab
where a computer tells you what's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when they really threw down the
first layer rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think only one or two potency
scandals like that have actually happened
[SPEAKER_02]: in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's almost an urban legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite purely.
[SPEAKER_01]: People outside of the industry are the
ones that you hear saying they paid for a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always those people, the people that
aren't involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys myth busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly unlikely that anybody is
paying for a lab test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen stores bullshit customers for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stores can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Salesman can like, there's not an oath
that you take where you swear on a
[SPEAKER_01]: constitution of like, I will do whatever
the fuck I have to do to get tips in my
[SPEAKER_01]: tip jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the oath to Budtender.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The owner only cares what my numbers,
my sales numbers are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my sales numbers are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I tell you what you want to hear as a
customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to be smoking,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to be in my dad's?
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is going to be in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I going to be just... They haven't
thought this out at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no talk about practicality or
functionality at all because the people
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it know and want it to kill the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody else is just hearing the,
we got to protect the kids piece of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it's built.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been packaged right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far there's been industry pushback,
but not organized or focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one might stick around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should get hammered down into nothing
quickly and brutally because it's absolute
[SPEAKER_02]: backdoor horse shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's detrimental to the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they put it up to a vote and we got
voted out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they really put it on the ballot and we
got voted out, I'd have some serious soul
[SPEAKER_02]: searching to do, but this isn't that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is them trying to slip a,
oh, we're just trying to help out the
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we already make it infinitely harder
to get a weed than we do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: bullets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say a bottle of whiskey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can drive down the street and get enough
whiskey to kill me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally no other product is limited like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing out there that... I mean,
because recreational cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational Colorado, which is supposed
to be legal just like booze, but I can go
[SPEAKER_02]: to the liquor store and buy everything I
can pay for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the gun store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I might have to wait a while to pick
up some guns as opposed to others and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not a big gun guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know the ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I could get the pistols,
but not the rifles or whatever the fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I know that I could be like,
give me all the bullets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And normally like right now there's a
limit of like one or two per customer
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's a shortage, but normally
they'd be like cash or charge,
[SPEAKER_02]: sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have the boy get the dolly and we'll
start loading your truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, same thing with farm tools or
whatever the fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hurt myself with anything to be
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've already got it limited to an
ounce per person per store.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to amass a bunch, I guess you
can go to store after store after store
[SPEAKER_02]: and buy your ounce at each store every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the teenager can already just go
to the liquor store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flash a fake ID just as easily as going to
15, 20 different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And walk out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already made it much harder to
acquire a shitload of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got a bigger burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got just window dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that want something,
find a way to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how supply demand desires
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's either legally or illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fucking humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have desires.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have wants and needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ways and means to get what we
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll fucking make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should call this the Karen bill
because it sounds like just a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking Karen's trying to get all Karen-y
on our fucking product here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The national group to keep an eye on is
called Project Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been pushing the THC is more
potent or the THC in our marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: products is higher than ever before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your grandfather's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've literally been saying that since
we were in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when we were in school in the 80s and
90s, it was all marijuana is way stronger
[SPEAKER_02]: than it was in our day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've literally said that every year
radical Russ added up and it has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like 2000% THC to be if they were right
each time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit stronger every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am pushing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of us out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my breeder friends who are
out there trying to push the limits on
[SPEAKER_01]: that THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stop higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: More potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also more Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about the Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only place they've been successful
with a constant potency cap is in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, Vermont has a potency cap of
60% for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Washington State is considering
similar legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The anti pot groups have figured out that
don't do it isn't a winning message.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're shifted to a couple of
similar toned down messages like just go
[SPEAKER_02]: with decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow decrim is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver was decrim when I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't fucking better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with cannabis is more potent
now than ever before.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big alcohol and big tobacco are going to
take it over, which I chuckle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if either one of those industries got
into marijuana, they'd be selling a much
[SPEAKER_02]: safer product to humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like Marlboro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave them way too much money for way too
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they started selling weed,
they're switching to a product that kills
[SPEAKER_02]: zero people a year versus one that kills
400,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a net win for humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they think it's a winning argument to
be like, they might get into it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bring them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the people like me have been busy
working for the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't been fighting a good fight
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the people on the other side are
starting to gain some traction again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody needs to buck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I said it a bunch last time I
was on, but find out who your elected
[SPEAKER_02]: representatives are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a one quick internet search away and
email them as often as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it legal where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, if it's legal where you are,
the rules can be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Colorado issue here,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who do they contact here in Colorado to
try to prevent the source?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of your elected reps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just if you're in Colorado,
it doesn't matter where you are,
[SPEAKER_02]: say who's my state representative.
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever your area is, Aurora,
Denver, Thornton, Pueblo Springs,
[SPEAKER_02]: the names will come up, send them an
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down here in Pueblo, you're looking at
Leroy Garcia, Danae Escar, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Boebert's our national rep.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not going to be super helpful with
federal legalization, but y'all can try.
[SPEAKER_01]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do like another two hours on
what's happening nationally and federally
[SPEAKER_02]: because there is something like 850
marijuana bills in states in Congress
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of movement everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a dude from Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he was the attorney
general or the governor saying that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize marijuana, it's killing your
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was serious when he said that into
a microphone staring at a camera and he
[SPEAKER_02]: was getting eaten alive on the internet
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a whole different faction
that's just eating it up and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, he's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they throw out nonsense like
traffic accidents or schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of our age, like our
generation, the older people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: programmed with the reefer madness,
with all the hysteria, unfortunately slash
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunately they're passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're disappearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're COVID fucking wiping them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting old.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're retiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The younger generations are all about,
let me do whatever the fuck I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generation dreadlocks, the generation,
what do they call them?
[SPEAKER_01]: The millennials.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us are them us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just like, let us do what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty soon, a lot of the silly control
stuff is going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that's the hope, but they've been
saying that since we were kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking away words and feelings
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not allowed to have certain words
and feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know where the future is going,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really thought I had a plan and some
hope for the future until I thought deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they took away words from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I just kill the whole show?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go there, but no, I don't think the
listeners are going to like my views on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they do limit the potency levels on
flowers and concentrates, the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: industry will have to redesign their
entire SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their production facilities, their
equipment, everything will be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way worse than that because you can't
change potency with an SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't throw less CalMag in the bucket
and have the potency go from 31 to 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with concentrates, they just do what
they're doing now and then add 85%
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why anyone would want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed to destroy the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even cloaked or veiled at all
with that or other than the thinnest
[SPEAKER_02]: garnish of think of the children nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really, really ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that this is gaining traction
drives me fucking nuts because the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: argument for it is nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potency thing, it's not more potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than it was before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always had concentrates with butane
extracts and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've purified it recreationally,
but that's what Marinol is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not new or special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just advertised more so that
everybody knows about it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that there's a logical fallacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the name of it, but it's when you
see something for the first time,
[SPEAKER_02]: your brain goes, oh, reggae must be new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody that's not clueless
about reggae goes, oh, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole section in the music
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: How have you never seen this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same thing with hash when
you're like, well, yeah, I know that wax
[SPEAKER_02]: and shatter looks scary and that dab rigs
look kind of scary, but do you know about
[SPEAKER_02]: black tar hash and the hot knife hits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause not any less scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh my God, what was
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start explaining some of this
stuff and their jaw drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, there's inevitably one
old guy in the group that's giggling and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you're the fucking one that
went to parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everybody in the generation above us
knows about hot knife hits or a little
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of hash on a pin in a match book
under a beer glass with a straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like before dab rigs, they had a bunch of
stupid ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many young listeners minds like,
what's he fucking talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys go, go think about old videos,
old knife hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to put the hash on a pin with some
heat under it somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can put a cup over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the hash burns, you catch all the
smoke in a cup and lift it up and suck the
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke out of the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have to do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take two butter knives and set them
on the stove until the ends glow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of blow torch and a banger,
you're just heating up two knives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'd have a glass or a plastic
straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd mash a piece of hash between the two
knives and free base it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no other way to say it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Weezer had that song back in 2001,
but only people who traveled
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally or were really into
cannabis knew what the fuck they were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like, it's not new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just redressed is modern hash and
it's allowing people to replay fear cards
[SPEAKER_02]: that they haven't been able to play in 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at an event and back in the day,
they would sell us a CO2 concentrate oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's dab oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could dab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could smoke it, but it would come in a
syringe, not like with a needle on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's how they would measure it out
and suck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosting kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's an oral syringe is actually
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you could feed up a kitten or
something out of this little syringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just put in the kitten's mouth and
shove the medicine down the kitten's
[SPEAKER_01]: throat instead of having to get it to eat
something or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I used it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the owner of this place saw the
syringe and he tried to make us all leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you guys have to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, bro, that that's weed in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had, they did not believe us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to sit down and educate him because
he saw what looked like a syringe and
[SPEAKER_01]: completely, there was no talking,
no fucking, it was just over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so instead of throwing your cart out,
when it's, it goes empty for the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time, because the cart's not toast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can save a few bucks by refilling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every now and then some anti-pop mom
will get on Facebook and share a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: cell phone photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: She snapped inside a dispensary or a
screen grab off a dispensary menu on the
[SPEAKER_02]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll include a picture of the cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll include a refill syringe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the next two, three months is
I watched this photo gets bounced around
[SPEAKER_02]: the echo chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the anti-pop world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get so fired up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, they're injecting THC now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I heard it causes instant
schizophrenia and they're injected a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred percent pure THC and it's doing
crazy things to these teenagers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's a plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no needle, no needle, no needle on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we're not shooting up THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those syringes decorative frosting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, a lot of times that's RSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: You scored out just a little, like a pea
size or a piece of rice onto your finger
[SPEAKER_01]: and eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just put in the syringe cause it's
easier to push it out and dose it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, we're not going to shoot it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys honestly, that same club,
I pulled out a bottle of water out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: backpack to fill up my dab rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy said, you can't bring
beverages in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, bro, it's water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can bring water in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a gift to buy beverages here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it's to fill up my pipe,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he almost made me throw my bottle of
water away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, we're not coming back
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we need real cannabis spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, if your state isn't legal yet,
you gotta be writing everyone in office
[SPEAKER_02]: right now saying, here's a way for us to
make millions and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the information is online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now you can put together a hell of
an argument in like an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Email me if you need more information,
send me a message on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like write a template that people can copy
and paste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so, it's so, so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put it on your Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hit what we hit 10 billion in tax
revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might've been 1 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just hit another major.
[SPEAKER_02]: Million dollar milestone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are all the roads still all fucked up?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we hit a billion dollars.
It's math.
[SPEAKER_01]: The road's still like a wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people ask that about the roads and
the schools all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just cause roads cost more than
you think roads cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Colorado rakes in what seems like an
amazing amount of marijuana tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying it's not helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the anti-pop people work very hard to
make this fact seem shocking, but our pot
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue is about 1% of our state budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I mean, 1% doesn't sound like a lot,
but the number is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's Colorado spends a lot of money
every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does your state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 1% is super helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 1% less fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's 1% better financially in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of our cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the most part, that's business
that's already happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody I know that smokes weed,
smoked weed before it was legal to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that includes the people that have
become legal since legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all smoked illegal weed before they
were legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like we might be going back to
smoking more illegal weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they start fucking with my
concentrates, Mike, I'm not going to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: 15% dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be pouring the entire gram into my
fucking, into the banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or trying to figure out how that that'll
be the immediate response by people like
[SPEAKER_02]: us is down at the head shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a new product where you use
solution A and tab B to turn your 85% crap
[SPEAKER_02]: hash back into 90% good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it'll be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they fixed the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm getting one fifth of my THC,
do I get one fifth of the price?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I get four?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pay for that filler.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's fully not functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's how I know that there's no
good faith.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was good faith here, they would
have at least a couple of people who
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how the cannabis industry works
and how we got here that would have talked
[SPEAKER_02]: them out of ever attempting this bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, if your goal is really to
protect the kids, there's a million ways
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can protect kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it used to be my profession.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my wife's profession.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people whose job could be
briefly or lightly described as protecting
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they could all use fucking more money
and more funding and more resources and
[SPEAKER_02]: more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this isn't it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a kill the marijuana bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the marijuana industry bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Karen's responsibility to make
sure my daughter doesn't get high potency
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one that bought it at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the money, the adult ID,
though I was going to say the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana card, but that's not even
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got all the credentials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my house where my daughter is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my responsibility to make sure she
doesn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not Karen's responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Karen, stay the fuck out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got this under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even that confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the world is full of stuff that
potency matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've got three different strengths to
town on my fucking cabinet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take like eight of the little ones,
but if I take eight of the big ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be my last fucking headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the vodka.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I screw up and drink the vodka like
it's Corona, really bad things are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to happen in my world that aren't at all
intended or suggested by the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because potent hash exists doesn't
necessarily mean it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just means there's nuance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That middle American never noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see a bunch of shooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see big ass bottles of vodka at the
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, we've been going for
approximately 40 something ish minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a couple of edits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we talked for a minute before we
started going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we covered all of the major notes
that I have made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any magical Mike moments that
you would like to recap, regroup,
[SPEAKER_01]: re ramble upon before we start wrapping up
this beautiful podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, just keep writing your names and your
names and your names.
It makes no sense.
How's everything going on?
We're doing all the stuff you've been
saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank all of our elected
officials and keep an eye on the anti-pop
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd because they're gaining traction
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always got to be wary of stupid people
in large groups because they can do an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing amount of damage if left
unsupervised.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people have listened to this far,
they're probably interested in the social
[SPEAKER_01]: art and the activism side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know how to help us out and
be on team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike, remind them once again how they
can find you so that you can help them be
[SPEAKER_01]: a part of team legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Twitter at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws.

get us death threats.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to take me a minute to get
back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my new year's resolutions
was to be better at answering emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's hard when there's so many every
time you share your screen when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: prepping and I see something like a
notification bar, it gives me so much
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking anxiety, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I got the volume of traffic you get,
I'd cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your notifications shouldn't be triple
digits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to guess there's one of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are thousands of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate never stop sending us stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it does take me a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stay up late.
[SPEAKER_01]: At night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get up early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stop, but don't feel like I've
skipped you, abandoned you, forgotten you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be next on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be way down the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just have faith in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my best to get to all of the
content that you guys are requesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just, I keep saying there's one
of me while Mike is on the screen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you guys know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly just one of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we go from there, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got way off on a tangent there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to confirm that there's only
one Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some people, there's only one white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually I listened to another podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about their friend, white Mike
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have to, we even have sub headings
that are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's just too many mics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That better not be you out there to live
in the good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That other white Mike I hear about,
he's having too much fun and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I was out having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a lockdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my kids has a COVID unfriendly
health conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're on, we're still on super
lockdown.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has been a hobbit for a minute now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just shakes his head and looks into the
camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that wraps us up here for this
episode of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some dabs and we're going to zoom it
up together, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we don't get to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's late at night here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quiet here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're going to eat some gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit on camera even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I'm going to talk about that
edibles challenge on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm going to recap the embracing
organics edibles challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a brief talk, but we'll hit that
one up on the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're not going to blow it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save that one for the next episode teaser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tie in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do plan on talking about renewing my
medical marijuana card and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that edibles challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think I've got a question about
Patreon and then a, um, a photo question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like popping photos into the video
question is the stuff that I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighted for the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't give hints about the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for making it this far in the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, thank you for being here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take a big fat fucking dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I'll be back in a couple
of days with fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe a big shout out to my buddy buzz,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shout out to Mike also for being here
until next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a fat dad and give your mama a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, I gotta piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be back in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we'll dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do the same.
Okay.
