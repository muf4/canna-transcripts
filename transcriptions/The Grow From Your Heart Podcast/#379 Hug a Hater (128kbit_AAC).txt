[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode 379 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Mike is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for making the time out of the day
from the little ones and making it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like one guy hates you,
but a lot of people requested you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got way more than one hater out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one finally expressed it out loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, this episode is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need new genetics in your garden,
make sure you check out the Hella Dank
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Company at www.dankseed.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, it has become tradition that we
start the podcast off by letting our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends know what we are dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's tell them what we just took dabs of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we just hit the Stardog fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a good chatty energy,
which that's what we need for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned lately that almost all of the
dabs give me chatty energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing with some stuff lately
that is just like an off switch for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least for people like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched Deb and Granny hit some nine
pound hammer today.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was giddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's talking about all the shit she's got
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, let's take a dab,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she hits the nine pound hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like somebody fucking hit the
slow motion button on her for about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was like, I was like, damn,
I just watched you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, you never see Granny sit
back in the chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she just like sat back in the chair
and took a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, you know, I got really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had to like re-check herself,
readjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens to the best of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had to recalibrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, we are hitting the Stardog
fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, how excited are you that Apothecary
is 4.5 miles from my house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a similar distance from your
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves me so much time in the damn car.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite things, just random
shit that happened is I walked out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Apothecary a few days ago and Mike was
walking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I came around the corner, I was like,
I think that's Jeff's car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I had time to really think
about that thought anymore, he came
[SPEAKER_00]: walking out the door with his purchase as
I was going in to make mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big old smile on my face, made a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey, bro, make sure you get
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to our friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They honestly, nobody pays me to talk
about the concentrates I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody gives me concentrates or helps me
out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just talk about what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we are enjoying the Stardog
fambrosia from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great spot over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad they're here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wallet, on the other hand, may not be
as excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 35, 40 minute drive was a nice
deterrent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't want to go today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like driving up and back now
that it's just across town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.5 miles away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everybody knows where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're drawing a map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apothecary is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in this goddamn circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's find him now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, my precious.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, we're going to get
real.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a regular listener in a previous
episode, I think it was two episodes back,
[SPEAKER_01]: I read some iTunes customer reviews within
those reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody stated that they did not enjoy
Mike's presence on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I politely told them how good of a friend
Mike is and how important I feel Mike is
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cannabis community, not only to the
show, but to the entire community.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's well spoken.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an intelligent dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just kissing his ass because he's
here, but I wanted to say, I said it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to say it to his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I appreciate you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody doesn't like you, bro,
skip the fucking episode because Mike is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has been around medical... He's not
as outspoken as I am in the same way,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he has been an activist, an advocate,
a spokesperson, a role model since I've
[SPEAKER_01]: known him, which was around 2007 or 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing it before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped someone sign up for the first
time on the medical marijuana registry
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent eight months working to get a
friend of mine on the registry and we
[SPEAKER_00]: finally succeeded in 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, Mike has earned his spot
not only on the show, but in the community
[SPEAKER_01]: and he should be accepted and involved in
this as much as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just people with a big mouth like
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make this shit possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go to the city council meetings as
much as I should because I'm prejudged by
[SPEAKER_01]: my appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big reason why more of the
community isn't involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're speaking on behalf of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you come check with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, hey, they're going to make
new rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we work for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get my opinion as a grower,
as a heavy consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both heavy consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call you a heavy consumer,
I'd say, compared to most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our circle, you're one of the
lighter consumers, but on a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're much more involved in the medical
consumption side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more on the... I don't even... The
hip, trendy fucking side of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I mean,
because this is a free-form show,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you all haven't picked up on it yet,
if you were looking for the second part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering series Jeff is doing,
this is not going to be that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be Monday, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said stick in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick around and tune in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds gross when you say stick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually sent Sanjay Gupta a couple
of really impassioned emails and social
[SPEAKER_00]: media messages about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a weed for focused on THC side of
the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere over the last five, six years,
seven years, we stopped thinking of THC as
[SPEAKER_00]: highly medically active and started
thinking of it more as the fun side while
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not at all true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use THC for a number of medical
components and I consider you both a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and a rec user.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC has medical applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millions and millions of Americans and
even more tens of millions of people
[SPEAKER_00]: around the globe use THC medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're definitely one of those people,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also a fucking stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me take that away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that my first two dabs, those are
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That third and fourth one, those are
purely recreational dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fifth and sixth one, that is just
party time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there is a limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got some other medical things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even talk about, because honestly,
I don't think anybody cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a stomach condition that really
fucks me up sometimes and I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but high limonene and high THC strains
work very well for my brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it just feels like my record
skips a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my CD, like remember when we had CDs,
that's how fucking old I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your CD would skip, like just every
once in a while, you just, you just know
[SPEAKER_01]: that on that one song that on Come As You
Are by Nirvana during that one course,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I don't have a good gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain will do that occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't predict when and where,
but I get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I keep enough limonene and THC in my
brain, it doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds crazy because like you're
putting THC into your brain to fix a skip.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it really puts the puzzle pieces back
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lubricates my record player.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to describe it,
but it makes the... What we've learned
[SPEAKER_00]: about the endocannabinoid system over the
last several years is that it maintains
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that particular system does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your skeletal system makes it so
you're not a fucking blob of flesh on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your vascular system moves blood around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your endocannabinoid system makes sure
that all the other body systems are
[SPEAKER_00]: working the way they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of balance themselves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why cannabis has so many
different medical applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's not affecting one system
or one part of your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affecting the system that governs
everything, except breathing and heart
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first time, I wish this show was a
video show because when Mike said skeletal
[SPEAKER_01]: system, I started doing the robot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't help it folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll start making shapes and shit
to elaborate my points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeff just looks at me like,
dude, no camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come out though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mouth will make those shapes happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep doing it with your hands,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, the endocannabinoid system is...
I really think it does balance things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to sound like I know what I'm
talking about medically, but I know it
[SPEAKER_01]: messes with blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It messes with blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It messes with hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can balance and throw things out of
whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: If things are already a little out of
whack, it can make it worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also dial things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can exacerbate and fix a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure that it's like a little,
like a little Bondo for my dent,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little divot in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that limonene and the THC just
smooths it over and just makes it not skip
[SPEAKER_01]: so that my thoughts can complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see sometimes, I'll be like,
fucking, what are the three words that are
[SPEAKER_01]: blank in my brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two dabs later, just smooth as can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a whole podcast in one cucumber
boat wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it boat or bird?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's boat.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys know what we're talking
about... If you guys know what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, you are a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy, DB,
because I am DB, not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep looking down at the table and
smiling big because there's enough hash on
[SPEAKER_00]: this table to keep us just roasted for
like almost 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing some things in New Mexico,
business and pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm down there, I get to go hang
out at my friend's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got friends in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get to see the New Mexico available
product and I'm not trying to bash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to politely say I'm not going
to bash New Mexico, but they're behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not quite up to us, not quite
caught up to us on concentrate tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm in New Mexico, I've got to...
I don't think I'm allowed to consume in
[SPEAKER_01]: New Mexico because I'm not a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to consume in New Mexico,
I wouldn't be as spoiled as I am here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I get back, I look at the table
and I'm like, oh, I'm so spoiled when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: here, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of very real ways we've been
living in the future for a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to cannabis products that
are available, the quality of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products, the glass that's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to shout out Albuquerque and
stand up for Albuquerque when you say you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't bash them when you say the glass
that is available, dude, Albuquerque is
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping up on the glass scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of artists down there
that have hot glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some good work in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to those folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I didn't write down any
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of folks that I saw
their work that do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who they is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an Albuquerque glass blower and
you're doing it, you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get stuff on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post something or I'll share
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I always get a message from
somebody that's removed from legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, it's an aunt of mine actually
sent me a message a little while ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: someone she knows ended up in an anti pot
conference and then she was given
[SPEAKER_00]: literature and she sent me messages trying
to like fact check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was laughing really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was laughing hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid to get pulled over with my
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in a diamond container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course this says internally flawless
series, apothecary, extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's got the place on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I bought this, it comes with
a receipt receipt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a video on YouTube you can pull up
where they throw some dude in jail over a
[SPEAKER_00]: crispy cream frosting flake, like donut
glaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like some little crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not like a euphemism for a
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the donut sugar
frosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a couple of flakes on his,
his format and they racked him for crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: meth and he was in jail for like four
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The test came, the preliminaries came back
from the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, nah, bitch, that's
frosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diamonds and hash and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been worried about that since the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I explain to a cop that this is a
refill syringe for my vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were a piece of shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a guy who has a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes by the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's red band or red band
because there's Brian red band who is a
[SPEAKER_01]: producer and a comedian who used to work
with Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's Dan red band is who I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a YouTube channel that was shut
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a Dan red band supporter,
big shout out to Dan and red band,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he was taken to jail because he had a
CBD syringe in his vehicle and they
[SPEAKER_01]: thought it was heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of CBD that was in that
syringe looked like a fucking lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: heroin, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much heroin is a serving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of glad I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know about a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 99% ignorant to heroin other than it's
like illegal and bad and you shoot it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this shit I learned on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know much about heroin,
which is kind of cool with me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they took him to jail thinking that
that was heroin and they ran it and tested
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, they came back and they're like,
dude, you can even have the remaining part
[SPEAKER_01]: that we didn't test back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave him back his sandwich syringe
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But dude, I love you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a fucking scrawny little white boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has no business in a jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't, he wouldn't and doesn't do
anything to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved here from another state to avoid
going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet he was scared fucking shitless being
in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not his environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a criminal and you're breaking
the rules and you're a thug, you expect
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I'll go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dan is not equipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not equipped for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't see that in life, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was, it got him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that thought more than once that
when I come over here, I bring some hash
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's that drive where I'm like,
man, this might be slightly difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I still have it in the original
packaging with labels and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this diamond actually says diamonds
and it says the carat weight of the
[SPEAKER_01]: diamond, a 10 carat internally flawless
diamond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got the cannabinoid and stuff
written on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a sticker that had all the
stuff right here, but I took that off
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can't open the damn jar
without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and I had the original packaging,
but yeah, I don't want to go anywhere with
[SPEAKER_01]: this giant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looks like a big old fucking crack
rock, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seriously does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's the, that's the one thing the
anti-pop folks have been harping on that I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually kind of agree with is yeah,
some of the new hash looks a little
[SPEAKER_00]: cracky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It told this is this free base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a two grand diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the size of your top thumb joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like a quartz crystal in a
hippie shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bigger than it's almost the size of a
junior mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's, it's a little bigger
than it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost two junior mints crushed
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two that got squished together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two, two, it's a gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's a hell of a rock
and you're going to be sitting in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a few, a few days while the cops test
that and confirm that it's THC and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to steal my badass crystal while
they're at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have my rock anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to dab that bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, that's several, several
bunches of good dad right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that if I got to, yeah,
I'm, I'm just so afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drive to New Mexico every few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to go down there and do some
work and do some pleasure and I refuse to
[SPEAKER_01]: take anything with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even drive down there with
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so I don't see any police down there
in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently doesn't have a speed limit from
what I've learned, but I still,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know as soon as I put something in the
car, they have a speed limit, but dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about how fast I was
going when I passed three state troopers
[SPEAKER_01]: and they didn't budge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't give a fuck at how fast I was
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know the minute that they were corn
hole in a drum, the white guy with
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlocks and Colorado plates go in the
speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, as soon as I put one fucking flake
of concentrate in the car, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to pull me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is not worth, then, then I came to
work in the Colorado marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: division, regulated industry at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just writing down a note because I
have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a, an out of country trip planned
for, um, around my birthday next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my family members was like,
I can take your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm not fucking not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, I'm just not going to
take anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you're really,
you're really not going to take anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, like I don't,
it's, A it's not that long a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: B it's not nearly that important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And C it's not an addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure and a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, there's a magic that
happens with potheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't look like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned earlier that I'm six five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dreadlocks down to my fucking knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing a grassroots hat backwards and
crooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a apothecary farms t-shirt on.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pants were a little baggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more in Merrill running, like mountain
running shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look like I smoke a pound of fucking
weed every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's obvious when I, you can,
you can tell when he talked to me that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike doesn't look like that as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a couple of hints.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the earrings that may give you
a hint that this guy may break some rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm on vacation, depending on the
country, like when I'm in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors shout at me like, yo, come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want some weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly, exactly where I'm headed
with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis consumers find each other and
cannabis sellers can find cannabis buyers
[SPEAKER_01]: like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know I used to be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can spot you out of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what country you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's someone whose job it is to sell
one gram and three and a half gram bags of
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person is trained to spot all of the
telltale signs for cannabis consumers from
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different little varieties that
pass through their area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been somewhere where it was
hard for me to get herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going back to like 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going to New York one time to
visit family and thinking like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're going for graduations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there'll be a bunch of beer,
but yeah, I'm going to miss my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed up and two cousins were like,
so beer weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've literally never landed a place
without her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't even have to be the white
guy with dreadlocks and it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb knows that you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb is supposed to be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb is supposed to be smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, if it's meant to be,
and if you don't find it, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else is going to be going on
that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned down maybe 30 different sale
offers in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 10 days I was there, I was just
like, let me see now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were smoking a minute ago down
that alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not interested, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much plastic was in it,
but it smelled like a tire fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not worried about it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, if you're a long time
listener of the show, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a tobacco consumer and a caffeine
consumer and I'm heavily addicted to those
[SPEAKER_00]: two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was facing a prospect of a trip for
10 or 15 days where I couldn't consume
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine or I couldn't consume nicotine,
I wouldn't be considering taking that
[SPEAKER_00]: trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm a hundred percent comfortable with
a 10 or 15 day trip where there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, there's probably not going to be any
lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried about my body pain that I'm
treating with THC and CBD, not my head or
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't withdrawal symptoms when you
don't have, you might not be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find myself with extra energy because
cannabis, obviously when you consume like
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, it's going to wear you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be a little tired from it
by the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't sleep as well if I don't
consume as much, but I'm sure after three
[SPEAKER_01]: or four days that would just wear right
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: My palms sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have, I have sticky palms for like
three days and it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm nervous for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my palms though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That balance is out of balance and you're
missing one of the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going to take you on a trip
and I told you that you had to go 14 day
[SPEAKER_01]: in 14 days, you were going to be gone for
14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got two weeks to prepare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to be gone for two
more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many days before we left on that trip
would you need to taper?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't consume cannabis and you cannot
drink caffeine on this trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many days before we leave,
do you need to start tapering off your use
[SPEAKER_01]: of those three substances?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is definitely happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be gone for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your kids and wife are going with or
without you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to come on this trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your life is on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added the kids in the mix too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cigarettes and both kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nicotine is a hell of a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can quit caffeine in a couple of
days and I'm just a prick for like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm short tempered in my, I've got a
headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask if you get the caffeine
headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 36 hours into a caffeine purge.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the word?
[SPEAKER_01]: A fast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to sometimes I'll just try to make
it a point about 36 hours and I'll feel
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, Oh, there it is right behind
the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five hours after I'm awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't consumed at least one
caffeinated beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started getting a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in Mexico, the last time I was
just drinking the local coffee and it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't keeping up with what I do with
Mountain Dew most days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not all the other ingredients
of Mountain Dew in that coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just the caffeine and there's not
even as much caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was having a pound of coffee,
but I was able to stay ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about a trip where
there's none of that, like either I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to kill everyone else on the trip on
day two, or this is going to take like
[SPEAKER_00]: major like work prep support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about how many cigarettes you smoke
in a day and then taper that off by 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't taper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm smoking, I smoke like I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just got to take your cigarettes
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got to do that about five days
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get over the asshole phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get about 14 hours before I break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If like I smoke normally for the day and
then I go to bed and then sleep for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time, like maybe stay to bed
for 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably get up and go four or
five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting a 15, 16 hours tops
before I'm like in a homicidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will fucking kill you or get to nicotine
rage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we just brought Chad shank on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know, you know who Chad shank
is, you're a cool motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you even know who Chad is,
but you just morphed into Chad shank and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember being much, much younger,
a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I just started smoking and I
wasn't addicted, I remember that you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like consuming anything now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody loves tacos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're forced to go two weeks without
tacos, it's like not even something you
[SPEAKER_00]: remember a month later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't remember that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's so much different with
nicotine, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in three car accidents in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them are directly related to on the
way to acquire nicotine that I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my focus was all about that next dose
of nicotine, not on the car driving behind
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as your friend, you know that those are
two problems, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that that's not like,
no, this, this one's going to kill me if I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't fucking stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the, as, as one of your,
we're getting old and I'm considering you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much soda I consume are like,
how the fuck do you stop kidneys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, quite often guys, I set with bottle,
bottle, bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hardest word for my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottles of water on the table and I offer
them to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, he rolls his eyes at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm fucking retarded for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink plenty of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's, I'm over here talking to
shit during the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need something on my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, we saw Jan Silent Bob do their
podcast and Jason news took lead in like
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking four red bulls and 40 five
minutes.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I don't know how you'd even do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that guy's brain is so prime for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs constant feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's just destroyed his dopamine
loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met more than one addict that's like
that, that when they're, they're out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world talking and chatting,
it's they pound red bull, like it's water
[SPEAKER_00]: and they chain smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he couldn't smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to just pound that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys, we're not spilling any beans
that Jason Muse was a heroin addict.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a recovering addict.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of why.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a great podcast about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very open about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not spilling anybody's beans that
he's in recovery still.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the man just pounds fucking red bulls
when he's talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go see Jason Muse and Jay fucking
dude, what's his real name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Smith.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call him Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't fucking think of Kevin Smith
suddenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go see them, pay attention to
how many fucking red bulls Jason Muse
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have set a good precedent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand how the caffeine and the
nicotine are a staple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we take those away from you,
you said homicidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to turn into Chad Shank,
which is really funny if you understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's shift our focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have removed your caffeine from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have removed the nicotine from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a raging asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that you've got to get on this
flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how far ahead of that trip time do we
have to start eliminating cannabis from
[SPEAKER_01]: your diet, so to speak, for it not to
totally throw your body in the shock if we
[SPEAKER_01]: cut it off?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no time, no time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hypothetically, if you weren't white
Mike and you were down to break some
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking rules, you could take some dabs
with me in the car as I drive and drop you
[SPEAKER_01]: off at the hypothetical trip that I'm
sending you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wouldn't affect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body wouldn't start having withdrawal
symptoms or shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took the really long route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with this trip that we're
planning because we're traveling to
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flight's fucking up my sleep
patterns as they're substantially more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the lack of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not even going to notice one of
the only two symptoms I feel at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm going to attribute most of
that symptom to the jet lag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be the end of March,
early April in Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having sweaty palms ain't going to be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be wearing a hoodie anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long of a flight is that, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 10 or 12, 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when I went in 2000, it was like
four or five hours to DC and then 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that last, that second flight,
dude, was fucking brutal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just flying normal civilian class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in a tube that long, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a bulkhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a little bit extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the first row of seats behind first
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get like an extra four inches of
leg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're our height, dude, every
fucking quarter, which matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 6'5 and Mike's what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 6'3, 6'4?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike's probably got a good 40 or 50
pounds on me as well.
It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, from the my back hip bone,
like at the top of my ass to my knee cap
[SPEAKER_00]: is exactly the same length from the back
of my seat that I'm sitting in in the
[SPEAKER_00]: airplane to the back of the asshole in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knee sits flush against your armrest
and my leg is locked in their heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to get on a ride at Six Flags
and the girl said, put your legs down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, fucking where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you want me to do with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: More than once I've gone to ride an
amusement ride, like a roller coaster or
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just like, yeah, you're too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I get that you're only 17,
but you don't fit in the roller coaster
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cage doesn't come down over your
shoulders anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, wait, you can build it for
450, 500 pound people, but you can't build
[SPEAKER_00]: it for people who are taller than six
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I made my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Mike has to eliminate the caffeine and
the nicotine from his diet, he will become
[SPEAKER_01]: a homicidal maniac, which I think were his
own words.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caffeine's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bad headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nicotine's a different class of drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we took away your cannabis,
you'd be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No withdrawals, no craziness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't sleep for a day or two,
I bet you, just because I give a lot of my
[SPEAKER_01]: energy to the end of the day energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It calms me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I just mellow myself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a couple of days, it's partly
the ritual is what I would miss the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take a couple of dabs,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's try this Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try this whatever we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: This citradelic sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just try them all and see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just part of the fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think after a few days, I'd be
completely okay with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, all right, we're not dabbing right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I'm on vacation, like you
said, you're going to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was on vacation or something,
it wouldn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, look at all the vacation I've
got to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even need to be stoned for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in New Orleans, I didn't miss
cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept running into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in Mexico, I ran into bad weed
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't worth trying to look or find
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of a stressful trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice to be able to go step away
from everything for 15 minutes and just
[SPEAKER_00]: break up a little fucking piece of brick
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty out a cigarette, fucking repack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I couldn't even get rolling papers
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'd go and try to get papers,
they'd look at me funny and try to sell me
[SPEAKER_00]: swishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, I don't want a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want a blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said break up some brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you humble, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes you back to those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that gave it to me were so
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew I was coming in the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to have some weed ready for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found some dude that was going to
sell them weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold them way more weed than they
were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave them enough money for a decent
amount of regular American bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got its equivalent in Mexi break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, you don't know what to do
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take an ounce and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, we're only here for a
few days, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice to be able to step away
and just have that ritual, break it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it up, roll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was more get away from everybody
and just let my own thoughts simmer for 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes rather than consuming THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: An actual vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, I feel like we've been
rambling for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start wrapping up this
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, before I get myself in any more
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else you can say into a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we should tell everybody how they can

[SPEAKER_01]: They're a nice loyal following.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the whole ivory army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun and kind of tight knit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't allow, if somebody comes in and
tries to troll people, the army just gets
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, no, bro, you can't be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just run them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to block people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ivory army will get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to reach out to the podcast
and you're not into all the social media
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you can always send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can answer your questions that
way, or maybe you'd like to sponsor the
[SPEAKER_01]: show, or perhaps you've got a product you
would like Mike and I to review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear what's on your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, don't forget the show is available
on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every episode is available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, we're at the end of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got a bunch of people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep leaving comments on iTunes and
YouTube and hit me up on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I'm on the podcast,
I get four or five new Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost never post to Instagram,
but you can follow me there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll get four or five more followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on Deb and Granny's live feed this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must have gotten 50 new followers
just from hanging out with Granny for
[SPEAKER_01]: about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in her live feed one day and I
commented, she saw my comment and
[SPEAKER_00]: shattered me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my Instagram just fucking got lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a stop sign in a forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all it takes is for Deb and Granny to
say hello and your social media will go
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friend Deb and Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you every day, Gail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you and Kevin are having a
wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everything is going your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you every single fucking day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was your chance to say what
you had to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hug a hater, fuck a troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should have been it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should have been all you said this
whole podcast, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That covered all of your points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of me wants to fucking just like,
I'll go smoking with a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just start this fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll record a whole different episode
here in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This place, we went a lot of places
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some editing in this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some stuff that is just for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not usual folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thanks for hanging out,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap this up before Mike
incriminates himself any further.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in a mood tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's already got his fucking headphones
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you should see this kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to turn off his mic so we
can dip and go smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, thanks for hanging out on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike had a good time with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's giving you a sergeant salute and a
big wave as he runs out the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: The door to go get that cancer stick into
his lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cold out there and he's still going
to go smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking savage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast ruled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back Monday with a fresh new
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy Reefer Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mattness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you next time.
