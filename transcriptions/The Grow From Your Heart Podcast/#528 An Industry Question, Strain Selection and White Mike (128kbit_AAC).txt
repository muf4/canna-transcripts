[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is time for episode 528 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me via Zoom is our buddy,
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your 420, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Splendid.
[SPEAKER_04]: He giggled and said splendid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not the answer I expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: That certainly was not the reply I was
waiting for.
Splendid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to stay home and I was told it was
my patriotic duty to have food delivered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did, and it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can talk all day about what you
ate, but it is your patriotic duty to eat,
[SPEAKER_04]: have food delivered.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're keeping all the local restaurants
alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you were doing a very good job at
keeping some of your favorite spots
[SPEAKER_04]: surviving during this situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a weird 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked about my 420 already on the
show because I've done a couple episodes
[SPEAKER_04]: without you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, was it weird as shit just doing a
420 at home this year?
[SPEAKER_04]: No event, no hype, no craziness.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little weird that there wasn't
any craziness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty low key these last couple of
years and the craziness I get is usually
[SPEAKER_03]: while I was trying to shop for 420
supplies related, more than big 420 event
[SPEAKER_03]: related.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you would have been at my booth with
us at the Dude Grows Cup over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 18th, you would have been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what we had scheduled,
but instead I hit up a local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: The day before I walked up, there was no
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent more money than I intended to in a
bunch of really pleasant ways and walked
[SPEAKER_03]: back out to my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next day I overindulged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as I mentioned earlier,
ordered some delicious, delicious takeout.
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt like it was more takeout and grub
and relax day than it was 420 for you this
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of 420 involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of 420 involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you got your 420 in.

quarantine.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this portion of the show, I like to
give shout outs to a few of the friends
[SPEAKER_04]: who support us on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just get right to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without all the folks who support us on
Patreon, there would not be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patreon is what paid for the Zoom
connection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoom costs a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We covered that with the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Mike a recording set up through the
Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that first trial episode sounded
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we bought the right toys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we did a good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you did a good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a right job selecting the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friend at Sweetwater for
helping me select the appropriate gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job to Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's now an audio producer, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets production credit now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.
[SPEAKER_04]: He nodded his head at first and realized,
oh, fuck, it's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this portion of the show, we're going
to shout out to our friends at Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start off with a big shout out to
our buddy, giant Mike and the dabbing
[SPEAKER_04]: queen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's send a big giant shout out to our
friend, Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's send some digital love over to our
buddy, Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always got a high five and a shout
out for my buddy, Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's send a giant girl from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the hardest working man in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is James Brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's send a big high five and a shout out
to my buddy, Keith K.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always got a fist bump and a high
five and a shout out for my friend,
[SPEAKER_04]: okeygro720.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
Todd K.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but certainly not least,
let's send a big thank you shout out to my
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy, Steve motherfucking Smith.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks and big shout out to each and
every one of you for supporting the show

[SPEAKER_04]: All of the information you need to support

[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes for all of my stoned friends to
[SPEAKER_04]: make it easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, you guys, for all of the
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike, I think I'm done with all
of the business for the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the part of the show where I'm
going to ask, what are you dabbing on
[SPEAKER_04]: today, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I'm enjoying a plethora of
options from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned I went a little nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did mention that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just now it was some Mambo batter rocking
93.7 total cannabinoids, 79.1% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've smoked the Mambo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a symbol of the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of sets you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sets me down at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a moving kind of guy, and that one
makes me less movement-y.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having trouble to stand on the
microphone right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find myself drifting back into my chair,
and I think the Mambo might be partially
[SPEAKER_03]: responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I might sativa it up on our next dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a break for the next dab
whenever you're ready, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just say when, and I can keep
talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take a dab, and then you're going to
have to talk, and I'll take a dab,
[SPEAKER_04]: but teamwork will make this shit happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I just stepped all over you
when you were trying to talk, but we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: fix that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Loving the Zoom format.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's very minimal delay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time we had more delay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This time it's like very nice ping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't get that weird echo, and yeah,
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Zoom for helping us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am taking dabs, since you asked,
of First Class Funk.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you dabbing on, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for asking, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you'd never ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today I'm hitting First Class Funk live
batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: First Class Funk is a blend of GMO and jet
fuel gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know those two strains very well,
and I can taste them individually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very familiar with many of the
strains in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get a lot of the same strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're growing a lot of the same shit in
the commercial and also the private grow
[SPEAKER_04]: sector here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clones get passed around.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all got the same shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can definitely taste GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I open the jar, the first aroma is
GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you put your face closer to it and
get the essence, that's where the jet fuel
[SPEAKER_04]: gelato comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sweetness kicks in.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My nose is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: People say I'm nuts, but other people
completely agree with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The package describes the flavor as hashy,
grape, fuel, and garlic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly get the hashy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grape is in there at the very end.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you exhale, the grape kind of chills
on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fuel, it's there, but it's subtle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The garlic is one of the most dominant
flavors in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, it's got me fucking talkative.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the back, it says it contains 66.91%
THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dig it, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been buying a lot of this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's reliable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color, the texture, the flavor,
and the buzz are all what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even kissing their ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like it that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is smoking Apothecary, and today I'm
smoking Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Green Dot Labs for the
first class funk, and shout out to our
[SPEAKER_04]: friends at Apothecary for that mambo.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm nice and medicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to do a quick garden update,
and then maybe we can read a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: listener emails, and I've got one more
quiz for you before we get to the listener
[SPEAKER_04]: emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about my garden, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using some LED lights, and I am new to
the LED world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two Canon LEDs in a five-by-five
tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are from Black Sale Market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to my buddy Keith at Black
Sale, killing the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful customer service, beautiful
communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we agreed that I would put lights in
my garden, the deal was handled,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the lights were here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They shipped that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'll send to the lights,
and then I got a shipping notification.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's always nice when you make a
deal, you shake a hand, and then you get
[SPEAKER_04]: an invoice and a shipping notification.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here they go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only took the time of UPS or FedEx,
however long they took, is how long it
[SPEAKER_04]: took me to get my lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I plugged those lights in,
I'm not even trying to kiss this dude's
[SPEAKER_04]: butt or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I plugged those lights in,
I went, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those lights are so bright, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to cover my eyes and lean back and
look for the plug-ins so I can unplug them
[SPEAKER_04]: and reorient myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this shit is super bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two of them now in a
five-by-five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got them over some clones and some
seedlings, and my plants look impressive,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are shorter and stout, more stout
than they usually would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were those Jack the Ripper clones that I
saw photos of the other day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those from off and under these lights?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are Jack the Ripper seedlings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are from seed, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are from those lights with the
super tight node spacing, lots of
[SPEAKER_04]: bushyness.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just got put into five gallon pots
and they've been under there for 12 hours
[SPEAKER_04]: at this point and they have exploded.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited with the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have finally got two plugged in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were comparing it to the equivalent of
the 600 watt light that was in that room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keith told me that they should be less
heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should produce less heat than the HPS
light I had in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so far, I feel like that's accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today is one of the coolest days we've had
so far or warmest days we've had so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not, sorry, I'm stumbling over my
word stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the warmest day we've had in a while
and it's not too hot in that room with
[SPEAKER_04]: both of those lights running.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rapid growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem to want to eat more nutrients
also.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like they may want more food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's because they're
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of them look a little bit
hungrier already for their size.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm impressed with the growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants are going fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not as much heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had them long enough to know if
there's an effect on the electricity bill,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it should go down compared to what we
were getting with the HPS light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited for this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what's happening in my little
tester area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some LEDs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm brand new to the LED world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't convinced.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see the photos I was just
talking about, check out Jeff's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the handle, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those will be on irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check out irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will try to remember to update the
Grow From Your Heart podcast Instagram as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a podcast for the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, social media can be
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I take a short break.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to be there too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I post and get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will try to post more to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly spend a little bit more time on
Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabuzz is a cannabis friendly social
media application.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't buy, sell or trade cannabis
there, but we do encourage you to post
[SPEAKER_04]: your cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can post your dab photos, your garden
photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join us on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a free application available on your
Android or Apple mobile device.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you join, find me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a lot of great things on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get a lot of opportunities to
acquire irey genetics and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder's seeds on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Mike, how's your garden going?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just joking, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like all the comedians asking about
dates right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to hear that, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the comedians.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your little assistant around
now, plus your two new assistants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is going to be good for building
shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a drink of this fucking
weird kombucha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even for kombucha, this is a weird flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to read this email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get hydrated boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirty hippie drinks, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirty hippie drinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stick with the good old soda guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: America.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happens if I have to fill
unexpectedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I expected of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it's exactly what I thought you
would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a Dr. Pepper since February
12th and we're recording now on April the
[SPEAKER_04]: 26th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that same vein, it has been three
months and four days since I've had a
[SPEAKER_03]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more impressive than a Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was watching it fuck up your
health.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad that my friend isn't killing
himself in front of me now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been some weird changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing fucking tastes right still.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll taste better eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what that sound was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made me drool just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carbonated goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the show back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what they expect when we
get two guys coughing going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said something about some emails,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes from our friends on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are subscribed to Patreon and you
send me a message on Patreon, I try to
[SPEAKER_04]: find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to print them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it's more likely you'll catch me
through email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to keep up with all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one of me and lots of you,
but please bear with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, hello, just a quick message to
say thank you for the nutrient episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up some new tips on how to mix
and get my PPMs and keep my NPK to the
[SPEAKER_04]: correct amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the addition of Cal Mag has been
great and I made an Epsom salt spray and
[SPEAKER_04]: my plants love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this person listened to the My Nutrient
Mix episodes, volumes one and two,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it sounds like they have improved
their gardens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to know that that helped out your
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a lot of time and energy into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Goal achieved, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when somebody says, hey, I did better,
that's what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole point of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's literally why we do this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one person got it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was worth my time and energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This also comes from a person who calls
themselves Prospect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're doing very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prospect soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get your patch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fucking full-fledged.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the right path, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We shouldn't make fun of him for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may get a phone call for that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, uh, hate aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Prospect on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing but respect, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing but respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, where are we in this message?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it says, uh, for everything else,
I'm using recharge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've also set up my contribution as
well as well deserved, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great work on the podcast for everything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using recharge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the shit for indoor tent growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recharge is a great product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fully endorse that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't pay me to talk about it,
but I use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have recharge in my garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do stuff to grow with recharge today.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look fucking marvelous because of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, um, I also have a 25 year old
daughter who is getting her associate's
[SPEAKER_04]: degree in digital marketing and business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Management.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 25 year old young lady with a degree
and associate's degree in digital
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing and business management this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she would like to get into the
Colorado cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our friend Prospect is looking for any
tips on where to get this young lady
[SPEAKER_04]: started.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be extremely, they would be
extremely grateful.
[SPEAKER_04]: She, unlike me, uh, is American and
currently lives in Florida, but goes to
[SPEAKER_04]: school in Utah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take it that Prospect is from another
location here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our Prospect friend over C
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it says, thanks Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I taught them today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you a pic to follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's growing some ivory genetics and
he'll send me a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will share the picture, uh, on the
Instagram probably because this guy always
[SPEAKER_04]: sends good photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mike, this is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a 25 year old young lady with an
associate's degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and where are we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Digital marketing and business management.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a couple of great areas of
focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could both be of great use in the
cannabis industry, but they want to get
[SPEAKER_04]: into the cannabis industry and they're
looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: For ways to get in and a good start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just because I know you and we've
been in this industry for a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to have very similar advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that this listener is going
to appreciate the, uh, kind of bad news
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of that we've got to give them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis space is so tight right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even before COVID, um,
but the federal tax burden is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of the, the wiggle room,
financially the industry is not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so positions like digital media
managers don't really exist like they
[SPEAKER_03]: should in an industry that's large.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get with one of the larger
chain dispensaries to get something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the other option that I was sitting
here listening or thinking about as you
[SPEAKER_03]: were talking is, uh, find a business that
you respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, uh, or you're interested in working
with anyway, that's smaller and could use
[SPEAKER_03]: the skills you've just learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but doesn't know that yet and get on
with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, as you develop a reputation with
them, let them know, like, look,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can help you, um, expand your business a
couple of different ways by doing ABCD and
[SPEAKER_03]: move up that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's sort of the route that I was
going to take.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I said we may have slightly bad
news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say that the way to get your foot
into this industry is to start at the
[SPEAKER_04]: entry level.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in the cultivation side,
that's a tremor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true for this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: This person, it sounds like they want to
be on the retail side.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not in the cultivation interest
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to be in the, uh, the normal
people's side.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to be on the savage side
of the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking they may have to enter as
a budtender or something as that nature
[SPEAKER_04]: because there are very few tiers in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like budtender and then lead
budtender or manager and then fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: manager.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you get with one of the
chains, which there aren't many of,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you get with one of the chains,
then you have more like the executive
[SPEAKER_04]: managers and the more manager spread out,
regional managers, quality control people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are a lot of positions
available, but you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_04]: start probably toward the bottom of the
food chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mike said, get in there as a
budtender, get in there as some sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: small time rep or something, and then work
your way up to where you just got to earn
[SPEAKER_04]: your spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many people here trying to do
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The degrees are going to help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also the degrees Mike has noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike has got college degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many jobs do you get turned down for
because you're simply overqualified?
[SPEAKER_03]: About 80% of the interviews I've been on
here, they're like, we, we'd love to hire
[SPEAKER_03]: you, but we don't even want to make you an
offer right now because we know we can't
[SPEAKER_03]: pay you what you're worth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we feel like to offer you what we have
to offer right now would be a kick in the
[SPEAKER_03]: dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just not going to offer it at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, dude, I'm fucking here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throw me an offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me have a damn job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, unfortunately that's the way it
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this person.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can be a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the chain people may be looking
for exactly what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mike said, some of the mom and pop
shops are looking for you and don't even
[SPEAKER_04]: know that they need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could start off as a budtender.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have to bite the bullet,
start at the bottom and then show them
[SPEAKER_04]: that you show up to work every single day
on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look professional, you don't ever have
a hangover and smell like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't make fucking excuses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like those are the people we don't give
advances to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So show them that you can keep up,
that you can catch up, show them that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're part of the team, show them that
you're qualified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then once we know that you can do all that
stuff, we'll give you an opportunity to do
[SPEAKER_04]: more, make more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you become management, then you
become assistant management, then you
[SPEAKER_04]: become all the other things above that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't, don't have too much hope that
you're going to come in and just start
[SPEAKER_04]: right up at the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome, but I don't want to
put your hopes up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You say digital marketing, there is a need
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that's also another
position's job, like their side job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's one of the other managers is
what they do when they're not other
[SPEAKER_04]: managing is kind of how it handles,
it's handled in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marketing is tough in this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also we're banned from advertising on most
major platforms.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a lot of ways, similar to alcohol or
tobacco advertising, more tobacco than
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, it's even more restrictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything we advertise in has to be somehow
verifiable to, I can't remember what the
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage is, but X percent over 21
readership.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 70%.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, yeah, we have to be really careful how
and what we advertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when parts of the industry fucked that
up, the backlash is instant and brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, be, be wary of the advertiser.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most businesses are very wary of how and
what they advertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even see a lot of dispensaries
on social media anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're mostly just on weed maps is the
only way you can really find a dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: or they've got a website.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're real savvy and they keep the
website updated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and some of that's getting tossed
from platforms, but a lot of it is they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to end up on nine news because
they had a cookie monster on the side of
[SPEAKER_03]: their building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like simple faux pas that, I mean,
no one saw coming until they were done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, Oh fuck, what have we
done?
[SPEAKER_04]: We put Mickey mouse smoking a blunt on the
side of our building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prospect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we helped you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that may not have been the answer
you're looking for, but it was honest and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have to start at the bottom and
work your way up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that is the way this
industry works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also you got to know somebody here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I hate to say that,
but it's not what you know, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: who you know right now in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they can make some friends,
start networking online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, here's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to all of the Cincy night and all of
the, whatever other type of networking
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis events there are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to those show that you can speak,
show that you're well-dressed,
[SPEAKER_04]: show that you're professional,
show that you can walk in with a business
[SPEAKER_04]: card and shake a hand and say,
this is me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the person for the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would really help out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, that's a good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were able to land to the two
degrees, you're going to be able to land a
[SPEAKER_03]: job in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just might take you a while to build it
up to the one you want.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver is expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo is affordable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look into where you're moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be prepared for that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The locations you listed, none of them
sounded local.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got some options.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of legal and medical
cannabis states out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to relocate, take the time
and pick the space you want to locate to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just jump or do whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people just end up here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have another email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our friend Prospect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you and your daughter do very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck in college.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look forward to hearing from you
again in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody else out there has an email,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got another message.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use my name on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to our friend Brendan.
[SPEAKER_04]: His message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to you during these times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your positive vibrations and words of
wisdom about the virus and about the
[SPEAKER_04]: quarantine life are uplifting,
educational, and should not make anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: fearful.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the loss of ignorance comes the
loss of bliss, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a really great opening line.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, thank you for all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot to digest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to do a run of iris strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering about the height and
stretch differences between lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_04]: golden goat S1, and the cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I be aware of any major differences
in feeds for these strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to stop right there and say the
lemon Jeffrey is going to get taller than
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may be prepared for a stretchier,
lankier plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That may be the problem in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I named it after me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two will play well together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, should I be aware of any
differences also is the cream typically
[SPEAKER_04]: indica or sativa leaning phenotypically?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right in the middle, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got that head wrecking sativa,
and then it's also got that couch lock
[SPEAKER_04]: indica to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cookies and cream to arise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a beautiful combo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes out just about 50-50,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes on to say, the reason I run
multiple strains is the personal need for
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit of variation in my medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you can dial in those strains
and pay good attention to them and give
[SPEAKER_04]: them the attention they need, I think
they'll run well together other than that
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon Jeffrey will get a little bit tall
on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll go really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where am I in the email?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to growing some
beautiful herb bred by a positive forest
[SPEAKER_04]: like yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the grow goes well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, I appreciate any insight you're
able to give me on these strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep producing the fire, both through
podcasts and genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love from Brendan.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lemon Jeffrey and the golden goat will
grow well together.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lemon Jeffrey is going to get a little
bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cream will fit in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all going to take about the same
amount of time to finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing I'm concerned with is that lemon
Jeffrey is going to get a little bit tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ask if I have any tips for growing
these strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have done full podcast episodes on all
three of these strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Type in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out those shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 30 to 45 minutes just full on
giving you tips about how to care for that
[SPEAKER_04]: strain and what to look for.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to YouTube, go to the grow from
your heart podcast channel, click on my
[SPEAKER_04]: playlist.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a playlist called strain
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: These descriptions will be in that
playlist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to listen to these.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to get all kinds of good
tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else out there, if you're
interested in those strains, I highly
[SPEAKER_04]: recommend the strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing some iry genetic stuff,
you can learn a lot from those podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that not all of the strains are up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a minute to do them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another email requesting two
strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to knock them out in the same
episode because those strains won't be
[SPEAKER_04]: made anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to put them to rest in that
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the last few seeds will sell out and
we could give it a kiss goodbye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brendan, I think you will have a
successful grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pay attention to that lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be ready for it to get kind of tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure which phenotypes you have got
of each plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you've got a tall stretchy phenotype
of lemon Jeffrey and a squatty phenotype
[SPEAKER_04]: of golden goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you've got the opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to predict that, but I know that
generally the Jeffrey will get taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you go on to say you appreciate any
insights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I say check out those podcasts you
wrap it up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep producing the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that you feel that the show is
fire and I'm glad that you feel the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics are fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you give me a lot of shout out for
my positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that you're seeing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that it's noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to keep a positive attitude in
these weird times because shit is weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some sort of relief and
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't do you any good if I came on
here and just cried about my problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here to lift you up, make you feel
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ja love.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if anybody else out there has an
email, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, we can start wrapping up the show,
but before we do, I gave you some
[SPEAKER_04]: homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that a listener sent me an email on
the last episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike mentioned that his wife mixed up some
magical hand sanitizer from two products
[SPEAKER_04]: and a listener was very curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they sent us an email saying,
Hey, what was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That combination that your wife put
together wasn't my wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Mike's wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, my wife, I gave Mike some homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, can you tell us how to make that
hand sanitizer we were talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't prepare it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my homeworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to want to get out
whatever your end container is gather up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used isopropyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use any alcohol that's over 60%
alcohol by volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got a high octane vodka or
whatever, you can also use that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used isopropyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't waste drinking hooch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't use booze.
[SPEAKER_03]: But two parts alcohol, as long as the
alcohol is 60% or better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The higher the proof alcohol, the better
you can get the consistency of the
[SPEAKER_04]: emulsion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be real runny if your alcohol isn't
high enough proof to add extra aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to do two parts alcohol to
one part aloe vera gel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want the alcohol to be 60% or better
by volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want the aloe vera gel to be a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any sort of cutting to the aloe vera gel
make it real runny in your hands too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just add whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: isopropyl alcohol you want to add to the
aloe vera gel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, we got some hand sanitizer online
that it works just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the consistency is just fine,
but holy fuck does it stink?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the homemade stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the consistency a little bit
better and it smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a project.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can save some money and they got
something to do while they're stuck at
[SPEAKER_04]: home.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had so much fun making it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't take that long at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just throw two parts of alcohol to one
part aloe vera and you mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then bam, you're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sent drops in the containers once you
separate it and you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's real simple recipe folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that isopropyl alcohol is
flammable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't do this in your open flame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't do it while you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the torch down first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the cigarette or the stove or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do it in the kitchen while you're
making ramen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're working with flammables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a little bit of brains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Mike, thank you for joining me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm loving the zoom format listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us know what you think of the zoom
format.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: More bunker sessions.
[SPEAKER_04]: More bunker sessions, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: More of two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to drive over.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, Hey, you're ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can use that extra hour for recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course we do sit here for like 30
minutes and take dabs before we even
[SPEAKER_04]: bother to press record, but that's just
two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that when I had to drive across
town to do this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it takes, it's a minimum of three
dabs before we can record.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we, do we want to wrap this show up or
do we want to ramble at them for a little
[SPEAKER_03]: while longer?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you might have something to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't got a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well then don't tease them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say the rumor is that we
get to go out and play again in a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to lift the stay at home
orders here for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a tiered way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to annoy the fuck out of the
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But are you ready to go back out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready to go back out anyway?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I've been trying for the last
couple of days to avoid social media a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, I went down the reopen now Facebook
group rabbit hole, which I do not
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even if you currently would love it
for the state to be instantly reopened
[SPEAKER_03]: fully tomorrow, don't go down that rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's like the worst of humanity
boiled down into a fine, putrid sludge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've avoided all of those groups and most
of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have, I shouldn't have looked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once I started looking,
I couldn't look away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I catch myself scrolling through
stuff and I go, Oh, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot that I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put boards over the windows more than
when I'm reading that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, uh, I think the, I'm mostly ready
to go back out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if the smart people are
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've got people in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to not go out for like,
I don't want to get them sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't want that hanging over me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I tend to listen to the
smart, smartest people in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if the smart people in class think
it's a good idea, we stay home on the
[SPEAKER_03]: track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, it can't be that bad if you're
just staying at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than fucking a lot of other
options.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm good at it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've said before, we have such an
advantage here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're fucking shut-ins long before
shut-ins were cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like all you bitches at level one and
stayed inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're level 80 already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were here since this shit was
beta.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, I could use, uh, this may sound really
crazy, but I can use a visit to the
[SPEAKER_04]: dreadlock lady, the person who works on my
dreads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm looking like a shaggy dog up
top, but as long as I keep a hat on,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro, quarantine hasn't gotten to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as I keep a hat on, you can't tell
as you over there scratching your kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: beard.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't going to be a video podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listeners for just to waste more audio
time for your, your afternoon where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: growing a shitty beard during quarantine
and see how long this keeps up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not joking when he says a shitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: My people were not gifted with,
with good facial hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the, uh, the etch a sketch face
or the guy with the face that you put the
[SPEAKER_04]: magnet beard on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never sympathized with a character
more than in Joe dirt when he's trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: describe that his facial hair just grows
all white trashy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause mine does too super bad,
super bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, it is going crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a solidarity beard with a
relative of mine who's being, who got
[SPEAKER_03]: talked into growing one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how long the kids actually
fucking hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it's the good dad, you're
scratchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, if I shaved, before the other
person, it'll be because my kids convinced
[SPEAKER_03]: me to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this episode won't be a video episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody can see what we're talking
about, but I think the next episode with
[SPEAKER_04]: myself solo will be a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to try to get more people on
zoom to do more video episodes with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's trying to talk me into doing video
shows guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I was headed with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to bombard Mike with inbox
messages, convincing him to do some video
[SPEAKER_04]: shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we need to buy him a tapestry for the
background and some shit like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll use the Patreon funding to get him
that set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but we got to get back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike on video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think the people will enjoy the
video show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got to back you up about six more
inches from the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't look like you're trying to
eat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, see it looks like civilized human
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to hold the microphone now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll give you one of these mic
stands or close to your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if we could just push the camera back
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they can't see it now, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how's that buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See now you're looking way better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we can see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get you lined up, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get Mike on video so that
people can fucking see him and then we can
[SPEAKER_04]: do this video show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the table, the PCs propped up
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost look like you know what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get you a little tapestry to put in
the background, hide all the playpen and
[SPEAKER_04]: all the other craziness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no playpen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say bondage gear,
but playpen sounded better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got all the toys out of my office.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least it's not full of like little
kids shit right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks more civilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coloring books and fire trucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our days are so different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, what else do you got for us?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was your idea to ramble on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to have something to carry
this show for the next three to five
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I know everything's weird right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody just stay cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just roll up another dude, pack another
bowl, throw another dab and just enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: life, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Government wants to pay to stay home.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can fucking do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just roll one up, shoot me a DM if you're
bored.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking tweet at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet at Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do they tweet at you, Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: Call your mom and say, Hey mom,
I miss you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to tweet at me, it's at
Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a tweeter is not your thing and you'd
rather Facebook it, you can find me at
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff, how would they get a hold of you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how smooth that was, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find me on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at ire underscore genetics on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send me an email,
it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, it feels like a good spot to start
wrapping it up since you gave me that
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet segue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to thank you for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for hanging out, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to get you on like every
other episode, every third episode or so,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I know your schedule is a little
bit chaotic, but we're trying to get you
[SPEAKER_04]: on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting into more of a rhythm now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might be able to do this a lot more
frequently than we have, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to get you going on video.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys tweet him, sell him, get that
video going or somebody send him a
[SPEAKER_04]: tapestry.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just needs like a tapestry and a stand
to hold it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think he'll be more comfortable
with the vids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Amazon, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick one out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_04]: smokers and growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, cultivators, consumers,
[SPEAKER_04]: industry workers, bud tenders,
packagers, fucking trim crew and lead
[SPEAKER_04]: growers, and even the folks in the
motherfucking office.
