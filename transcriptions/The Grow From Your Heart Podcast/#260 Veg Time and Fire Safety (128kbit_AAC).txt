[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 260 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cannabis activist or even
someone who's just curious about the
[SPEAKER_00]: current state of cannabis, this,
my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross Dejef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you

[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool is one of the guys that taught me
how to grow, not personally, but through
[SPEAKER_00]: his Weed Nerd videos, through his internet
ramblings, through all his posts,
[SPEAKER_00]: through all his blogs, through all of his
books, through his photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool inspired me heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Subcool to drop into my Instagram

[SPEAKER_00]: What is this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the choco-loaf shatter from our
friends at The Craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really digging the choco-loaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me nice and chattery, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, from The Craft,
I was dabbing the Stardog OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished the last of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super huge shout out to our friends at
The Craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: The panacea line is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta quit telling you guys what I like
because it's harder to find some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go places to get the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go places to get certain batters and
it's all sold out because I told my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends about it on the podcast and they
all go there and they buy it before I can
[SPEAKER_00]: get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gotta find more sources and you
gotta spread the love a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet or a Facebook message or
an email or something to let me know where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're shopping and where you're getting
super terpy hash and what kind of prices
[SPEAKER_00]: you're paying in Colorado, medical or
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, of course, you can find me on
Instagram, Iri underscore genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me personally, send me a
message however you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you dabbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you getting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know what's available that I'm
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got an email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reaching for the iPad here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it up on the iPad screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email takes a little different
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what we always think about and
talk about when it comes to growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's something that should always be
in the back of your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you should always think
about when you're constructing,
[SPEAKER_00]: designing or building a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, what I'm talking about is
fire safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna open and read this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see who's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose name do I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to press pause and see
whose name I'm supposed to use on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have a brief conversation,
but I'm going to read the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Rasta Jeff, how are you doing today,
brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your gardens are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says his full name and he said
I can read it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Alex Robles and I discovered
the podcast about six weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really enjoy listening to you hang
out and talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many episodes have you listened to
in six weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says I'm having a great time
catching up with the past episodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciating the block of older ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help me get through the mind numbing
parts of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people tell me that my long
episodes helped them get through a long
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I'm helping you guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started doing those long episodes,
I wasn't sure how that was gonna land on
[SPEAKER_00]: my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like you guys enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the compliments and I'm glad
I'm helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email continues to say, I do fire
suppression system like fire sprinklers
[SPEAKER_00]: and such in California for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can ever help you in this realm,
please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you talk about fire safety and an
indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to share with you what I
wrote about a product I used in my closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sends me a link and he also
says you can find me on Instagram and he
[SPEAKER_00]: gives his Instagram handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he wants me to give that
out or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me to bro, send me another
message and I'll put it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to flood your stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already said your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said I can read it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I want to thank you
again for all the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he calls himself grow,
learn, teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will probably be able to find him
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search for grow, learn,
teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to click the link and it
takes me to an article that our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to read you this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does talk about a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not paid to pitch a product or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just agree with what's written here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he happens to pitch this product that
is very useful to almost any grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be helpful to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to read this piece that he
wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never good when a fire breaks out in
an indoor grow, but it's even more tragic
[SPEAKER_00]: when that grow room is in our home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take this moment to say
something about fire safety in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all heard the horror stories of bad
wiring, catching fire or the plant canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too close to a hot light and
bursting into flames.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try not to think about it too much
because aside from having a clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: safe grow area and a fire extinguisher
handy, there is very little we can do when
[SPEAKER_00]: we do have a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on fire suppression systems for a
living, which means I spend eight hours a
[SPEAKER_00]: day talking about learning about
installing and maintaining fire systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a commercial grower has
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for our community of home
growers, options are limited because our
[SPEAKER_00]: realities are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need simplicity because by definition,
we're a hands-on group that will do it
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves if we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mobility is a must when some of us grow in
an extra room, closet or cabinet that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone has that sometimes has to be
moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the need for stealth if we're
growing our medicine in a prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: For an indoor home grow, there are
basically two choices from what I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We either have to get an overhead fire
sprinkler system or an automatic fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguisher, also known as an AFE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a picture here of an AFE
and it says an AFE.
[SPEAKER_00]: This AFE has been in service since 1993
and is designated to cover 60 cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little device, it looks basically
like a really small fire extinguisher and
[SPEAKER_00]: they took that fire extinguisher handle
with the sprayer off and it's got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure valve and it looks like a ceiling
sprinkler in an office building,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the fire sprinklers in an office
building, and it looks like you would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably hang this thing horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how it would be mounted,
how it would be used in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it would go up high, I would assume,
and then it would probably rupture when it
[SPEAKER_00]: hit a certain temperature in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever is in here will put out
your fire, is what I'm assuming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: looks of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just looks like a canister,
like a fire extinguisher with a different
[SPEAKER_00]: type of head on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says growing with fire sprinklers in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some homes come with fire sprinkler
systems, which is a great thing if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so good for the grower in us and
here's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros, they do an excellent job at
controlling and knocking down a fire that
[SPEAKER_00]: could burn your house down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons, there's going to be a lot of
water to clean up when the fire sprinkler
[SPEAKER_00]: goes off and unless you're using
waterproof equipment, you may be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at a total loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a fire in your grow room,
and your fire sprinklers go off,
[SPEAKER_00]: your lights, your air conditioning,
your dehumidifier, and your crop will be
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say the water that rains
down will have some form of bacteria in it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's been stagnant for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that water has been sitting in those
pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be nasty ass water that
may get you sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to ruin your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are flowering, all that
stagnant water will cause mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who wants to smoke plants that had
bacteria laden sprinkler water on them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fucking disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say when the system
goes off, bells and alarms will ring and
[SPEAKER_00]: first responders such as the fire
department and police will usually show
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need that shit in your grow,
especially if you're in an illegal state
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't need that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep reading the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll blame it on the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing in this chain of events sounds
like a good time, but it could happen when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing with a fire sprinkler in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, my AFE lets me sleep better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I found that gives me peace of
mind about this is an automatic fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: These beautiful pieces of equipment were
originally designed to put out fires in
[SPEAKER_00]: boat engine rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been repurposed over the years to
be used in everything from flammable
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid cabinets to server rooms and other
enclosed areas where water isn't a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I use are called fire boys and
are designed to go off automatically when
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow space or grow room gets to 165
degrees Fahrenheit or 74 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get the cubic feet, which is the
length times the width times the height of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room or space to make sure I get
the right size unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one will have enough agent in them to
easily put out a fire in the size room
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's designed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have to think about ventilation,
about the ventilation system when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about this type of extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an active or passive air exchange,
a high temp shut off, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: a high temp shut off should be put on the
fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These extinguishers work by flooding the
room with the agent when they go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it stays active in the air for a bit
to keep things from reigniting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intake fan could feed oxygen to the
fire, which could allow the fire to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: lit or reignite easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exhaust fan could suck out the agent
from the room before it's done its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you do install an
automatic fire extinguisher, it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea to put your blowers on a turn
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the heat gets to, now this sounds
weird, but if it gets to 135 degrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a fire in there and you need to
turn off the blower to quit feeding oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, you need to turn off the
extraction fan to quit sucking out the
[SPEAKER_00]: fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have those on a heat shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a good idea to have your lights
on a heat shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the room gets over 99 degrees and it
hits 100 degrees, the light should turn
[SPEAKER_00]: off until it gets back down to 85 degrees
and then come back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have something like that in the
grow just to prevent overheating and to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some things you should think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with one of these automatic fire
extinguishers, you need some heat
[SPEAKER_00]: detection devices that will turn off and
on the proper equipment, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, growers know when you have a fire
system, it doesn't mean you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have damage when you have a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system is only there to mitigate loss
if there is a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have smoke, fire, or water damage
and there is no escaping that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they show a picture of a whole bunch
of these fire suppressors and devices that
[SPEAKER_00]: says current models have a more
environmentally safe suppression agent
[SPEAKER_00]: than what was used in 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they keep going with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, no system is perfect and there's
a good and bad to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire boys are no different, but they are a
lot better than any other AFE on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros, they're rated for class A,
which is trash, wood, and paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and class B, which is liquids,
and class C, which is electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get the one for the electrical
equipment for your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the one you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of electrical shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what's gonna go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next pro is the suppression agent is
life-sustaining, which means if it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: off and you're in your grow room,
you more than likely won't drop dead where
[SPEAKER_00]: you stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air will get a little acidic,
but you'll be alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these agents could probably
make you super sick, probably fuck up your
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs, possibly kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like this one's not gonna be so bad
if you're there and it does go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, the suppressing agent
is considered a clean agent and comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: in a fine mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't leave a residue on any equipment
surfaces, so there's no powdery film that
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be cleaned off, like with other
automatic fire extinguishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like they designed this stuff
mostly for like computer rooms and server
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms and shit like that, to where if you
do have a fire and these things go off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could just go in and basically wipe
down everything instead of having to get
[SPEAKER_00]: water out of a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds way easier to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already sounds like a good idea and
nobody has paid me to read this or say
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found this very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like keeping my friends and my growers
safe and my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you may have overlooked the
importance of fire control, fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna keep on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says they come in different sizes to
cover different size rooms from 25 cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: feet to over a thousand cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says no bells or alarms will sound
when these go off unless you set it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: do so, which is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked about earlier, if you have
a fire and some alarms go off,
[SPEAKER_00]: some bells and whistles start going off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who's coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: The police and the fire department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe if you're in the wrong
place, the DE fucking A.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get yourself in trouble
because you had a fire trying to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, so these may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says they will ship to almost
anywhere in the world, which is always a
[SPEAKER_00]: plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the cons of using this product
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the clean agent has not been
tested on fruits or vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: much less cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes off in a room, with the
flowering plants in it, that bud is a loss
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion because I just don't know if
it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have a fire in there and this
little extinguisher goes off and it
[SPEAKER_00]: releases its agent, which is a secret,
so I want to call it the secret agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't told me what's in there yet,
but when the secret agent pops out and
[SPEAKER_00]: gets all over your buds, you do not want
to smoke that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have smoked the shit, or not smoked,
I've smelled the shit that comes out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire extinguisher before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a fire somewhere, had to spray
the fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells anything like that,
I don't want it near the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does get on the buds, don't make
hash out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispose of them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be glad that you didn't burn to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be glad that you didn't have a big fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live to grow another crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't pull a unit out of one room and
put it in a bigger room and expect it to
[SPEAKER_00]: work the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't have enough agent to put out a
fire in the bigger room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, however, pull one out of a small
room or out of a larger room and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a smaller room.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says you can only get them through
a distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't find them at a hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to Google them,
find them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, I hope this information
encourages everyone, every one of you to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about fire safety differently,
especially if you and your family live in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house in which you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more information about
different fire systems or how to size and
[SPEAKER_00]: order a fire boy, get a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, grow, learn, teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this at inmygrow.com is where
the link took me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has got a lot of stuff up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting started from seed is a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient guide is a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click on this, getting
started from seed link and just see what
[SPEAKER_00]: it says and what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada's plant in the vegetative state
part three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, he's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, go check out this guy's website in my
grow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is put in a lot of articles and it
looks like he's been at it for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause some of these are from 2000 middle,
the middle of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys go check out in my grow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Alex, thank you for for printing such
cool articles and being such a great
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am marking your site in my iPad here so
that I can go back and visit more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently and see what else you've got
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for helping me keep the growers and
listeners safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people may not think about fire
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be cool about fire safety is
what I think the commercial says you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got an
email you'd like to send to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got an article you'd like me to
read, it's got to be your article.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just send me some shit that
somebody else wrote and expect me to read
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy gave me permission to read his
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've written some stuff and you'd
like me to review it and possibly read it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show, send it to me in an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart and a hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously my throat's doing this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to sit here and clear my
throat for 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause real quick,
take a dab, take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging on for a second there
while I fixed my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get back into this, I owe an
apology to some friends of mine up there
[SPEAKER_00]: in the frozen fucking state of Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, Mike and I were
talking about Maine and Mike kind of said
[SPEAKER_00]: some things about Maine and I kind of said
some things about Maine and Maine I owe
[SPEAKER_00]: you an apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got called out on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends Nick,
shout out to Amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine's not that bad you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some cool people up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure of it because when we talk trash
about them, all six of the cool people up
[SPEAKER_00]: there sent me a message on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asked a couple of questions
recently about veg times and what type of
[SPEAKER_00]: veg times I prefer recommend and what type
of veg times I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your plants are in the vegetative
state, you've got a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal is to keep them vegging
until they're big enough, healthy enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: hearty enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape you need them, the size you need
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything's topped and trained
and set up the way you want it before you
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into the flowering state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the way to keep a plant in the
vegetative state is by controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a photo period sensitive
plant, which means if you give it enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light, it will stay in a veg state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the light starts reducing and you
get a certain amount of uninterrupted
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of darkness, that plant will go into
its bloom stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis' whole goal in life, like a lot
of us, is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cannabis wants to do is drop pollen or
get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to reproduce, make seeds,
so that it can grow the next generation
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep it into a vegetative state
by controlling the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant gets enough light,
it will not go into a bloom stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that plant gets a long enough
uninterrupted dark period, it will start
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go into a bloom stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we control the lights, we control the
amount of time that the lights are on and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some plants are very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have what's called a very sensitive
critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get just a few hours of dark ness,
they will start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, you have to go kind of hard,
which is why we do the 12-12, that almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all plants will flip at 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably get them to flip at 14
and 16, but 12-12 seems to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: universal combination to get every plant
to flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11-13 is also common, but 12-12 is your
best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get the best harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the best production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm really going to get off topic here
and get off on a side rant, but you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: notice outside, when you flower your
plants outside, they do start to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: before you have 12 hours of darkness
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because not all of the plants need
12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what we do indoors because the
light isn't as strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's something that I will add.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun sets, the sun puts off a
specific spectrum that tells the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, it's time to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of triggers the plant to go to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why things like sometimes light
streetlights and things don't disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: This depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This always depends on the plant,
but sometimes some small lights outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: will not disrupt your flowering period
because the sun was so intense all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you're awake, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just beaming down on that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it sat, as the sun sat,
I believe in a globe that we got around
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, as the sun sat, the curvature of
the earth creates a certain spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand exactly how this
happens, but the curvature of the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sun setting creates a spectrum of
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that red spectrum, I could go into
that, but I didn't read, so I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I need a little reading to do a
refresher, but the near red and far red
[SPEAKER_00]: and phytochrome red words all come into
play right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun sets, it tells the plant,
hey, it's time to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that plant actually goes to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the sun puts it to sleep like
that, it's way harder to disrupt that
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outdoors, yes, sometimes people say the
moon and the stars won't disrupt my
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor plants, but that's not exactly how
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been out there getting beat up by
the sun all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been indoors under a thousand
watt Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back to what I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to get off on a rant
sometimes on these podcasts, don't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's what I think you're
listening for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when I learn the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, so we've talked about what
makes them flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes them flower is you put them
under 12, 12, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, the sun will tell them it's time
to go to sleep, bitches, it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, you got to put them under the 12,
12, they start going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg times, you've got a couple of options
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The options that you have for veg time is
24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will live if you put them on
with 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your lights are not very strong,
if you're using T5s to keep some big
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants alive, 24 hours may be the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants don't get enough light,
yes, they may have a long light period,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also if the light is weak,
they may decide to flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people have big mother plants
where the insides get real bushy and leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: and the inside will start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in there and cut all that
inside shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more light, that won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough light,
instead of running an 18-hour veg period,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it on 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need to get in there and take
care of the plants, but a 24-hour veg time
[SPEAKER_00]: is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and a lot of other growers believe
that everything wants to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clones are on for 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut my clones and they're fresh,
I keep them on for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones don't get any sleeping period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they go into a veg cup or a veg pot,
those get a sleeping period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where I am and what I'm
doing, the veg period changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a couple of different
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 20 on and 4 off, or 19 on and 5
off, which are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very common in a mother room,
either 19 and 5 or 20 and 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common in a mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's long enough to keep the plants in a
constant veg stage so that anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: gets root-bound or likes to auto-flower if
it doesn't get enough light, those things
[SPEAKER_00]: will not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not giving it the light cycle
from outside, if it's not getting the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell it to sleep, I think when the
lights just go off and they're blank,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes them a few minutes, probably like
a full hour to get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them four hours, they're going
to get three full hours of sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: technically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything that's alive wants some
sleeping time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see them grow a little bit when
they come back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you just give them the four hours
or five hours of darkness, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: growth when they come back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the pros and cons of the
24-hour time.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-hour lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros of that, lots of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will not auto-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something that did flower,
you can bring it back to veg with 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The con of 24-hour time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always running your electricity,
always running your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants don't get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to look a little frazzled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 24 and 19, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 20 on and four off, or the 19 on,
five off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pros and cons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros to this, vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little bit of sleeping time as
a con.
[SPEAKER_00]: You save some electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You save some cooling time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You save time on your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your equipment will last four hours
longer now every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get four more hours out of your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That adds up to a few more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to that, I think a little
more sleep time is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get enough rest time on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not as happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that they're a little bit
stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: From other plants, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a little less light time is
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I do notice, the people
that use longer veg times, when you go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower, your plants do flip a little
more quickly than people that use a
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter veg time because the plants
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, wait, it just went from
summer to fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just jump in more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about changing
flowering from veg to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that dark period or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the 19 and 5 or 20 slash 4
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros and cons of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here are my two favorites,
the 18 on and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 hours on is plenty of time for those
plants to grow and suck up their favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, their favorite feeder,
which is light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want light more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 18 hours to absorb light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets them get a lot of vigorous
growth within six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets all of your equipment cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not running so much equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electricity is not being pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants get to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bulbs get to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also 16 on and eight hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the last one I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go less than 16 because
indoors, you're probably going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering if you go less than 16 hours of
light on, 18 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros and cons of the 18 and six,
you get some off time.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that sleeping time, you can see the
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you are going to produce more
humidity in those night times,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to find a way to get
the humidity out of there that may get
[SPEAKER_00]: really humid in those long night periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are veg times that I would
recommend the pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of up to you how you want to do
it, where you are, how much electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: costs, what your schedule is, what your
rooms are set up like, what your
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle's like, just how your growth
fits into your current scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can recommend, maybe run your
lights at night if that's possible because
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity is cheaper at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to keep them cool at night
because you're not competing with the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the lights go off during the
day and the sun comes up, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to fight with the grow light and
the sun, keeping that grow room cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run the air conditioning anyway
just to keep the room a little bit cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully nobody thinks anything's
going on because it's normal to run an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to grow, you should probably
be using that grow now because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pay for cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps out in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm off topic a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you about a bunch of veg times and
I told you different applications of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the large commercial facility,
I keep the veg room on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on 20 on and four off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we do 20 on and five off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running a lot of lights in a
large facility, every couple of hours
[SPEAKER_00]: helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have to replace as many bulbs as
we do, every couple of hours helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have to keep everything cool with
as much as cooling as we're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: every hour on the bulbs and ballasts helps
is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's four hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just seeing what works best for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grows, I do like to use the
18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: For mother plants, for my personal mother
plants, I do use the 20 hour on and four
[SPEAKER_00]: hour off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all of my clones, the clones go 24
hours on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my personal setup there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I've noticed, and I might have
mentioned this, I teased on this just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a long veg time, the people
that go 24 hours of veg and they never
[SPEAKER_00]: turn the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put the plants into flower,
those plants flower just a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, it'll take 10 to 14 days
to see flowers turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just went from 24 and then you went
to 12, 12, you might see that change
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in seven to 10 days instead of 10
to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do the 24 in veg or the 20 on
and four off in veg unless you were only
[SPEAKER_00]: going to veg little plants for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to get bigger and start
branching out, you want to give them some
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let those hormones move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants get some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your equipment get some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about how long you want to veg
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to be little,
you can do 24 on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you flip them, they will
really blast off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I taught you a little bit about veg
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you choose how long you
want to put your lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to get something to come
out of flower and go back to veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to be on for 24 hours or it's not
going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole episode about revegging
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's what you're trying to do,
go search for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I want to mention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's something I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if you tip your bud
tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you shop at a medical marijuana
dispensary, if you shop at a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis dispensary, I want to know if you
tip your bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about tipping a bud
tender?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email grow from your heart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet at GFY podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, do you tip your bud
tenders?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cooper Watts, if you're listening,
I'd love to get you on a podcast and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can talk about if you should and should
not and how you should and should not tip
[SPEAKER_00]: a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we can also talk about some
dispensary etiquette while you're here.
