[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show was brought to
you by our friends at seeds here now.com
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds here now.com carries seeds from all
of the industry's leading breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Ms. Jill genetics, Duke Diamond,
and of course, I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything at seeds here now.com is backed
by their award winning satisfaction
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my friends on a tight budget,

[SPEAKER_00]: It is
[SPEAKER_00]: become a tradition that we start this
podcast off my tongue and I completely
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back of the package says that it does
contain 76.9% total THC and non detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing the remnants of this package
to the camera here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the terp sauce left in the
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice ratio of terp sauce to crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrate got me nice and buzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the TK 91 full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, I am going to
answer a couple of patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some shout outs to some folks who
support the show on patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend og purple thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
ADHD grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Josiah W.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a big thank you shout out
for Dominic C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to send a big thank you
shout out to dab and Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I got that backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it's dab and Mike and the
dabbing queen but this should be giant
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and the dabbing queen is who I owe
the shout out to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a thank you shout out
to justice smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also send a big thank you shout out
to my friend Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a thank you shout out for
Xavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
let's send a big grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out and a fist bump to our friend
terp burglar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who supports the show on patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to make it nice and easy for all
of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we're gonna fade this music out
and we're gonna get down to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me guys in the
last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make a small mistake that we were
going to edit out right now we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: fix that the corrections department did
chime in rather quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the premiere of the insta of the
YouTube video, I got a bunch of comments
[SPEAKER_00]: that said yo, you said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that the rev wrote some books and
the rev did not write the books I gave him
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for the teaming with series
actually came from Jeff Loewenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave the rev credit for books he
didn't write I did not give Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Loewenfels credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to give Jeff Loewenfels a shout
out for some of his books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with a lot of his
techniques, but he still deserves credit
[SPEAKER_00]: for the damn books he wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want credit for my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jeff Loewenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to disagree with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He disagrees with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could still be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still smoke a joint with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd still have dinner with him if I saw
him broke down the highway, but can pull
[SPEAKER_00]: over and help him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just disagree with some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still the man gets credit for his hard
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I did say I was going to read
some Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quit rambling about silly shit and
get right to the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Patreon message on today's
episode goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from our friend smoke what I know
what you're smoking, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Hey, Jeff, nothing important but a
random thought I want to see if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about these are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These turn out to be some of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said with such limited plant counts,
is it possible to graft these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: together to make a super mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've joked about grafting before,
but if you could have a plant with five
[SPEAKER_00]: strains grafted together, you could turn
into five different strains with one
[SPEAKER_00]: mother and stay legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says hope you have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a high thought for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have read seen heard a lot of grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a breeder who breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my seeds to be very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my strains to be very distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow strawberry starburst,
I expect strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow Sunkiss, I want Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the biology behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the science behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I took so the idea behind
grafting would be to find a plant with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very quality root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants don't root well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants don't veg well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants make shitty weak stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could take one stock that grows well
and we could put a little slit in the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could take a cutting off of
another plant, put it in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: tape it toward it, stay safe, maybe apply
some gel in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you'd put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not my gig, my bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that branch from the other plant,
let's just say the Sunkiss branch is now
[SPEAKER_00]: on a strawberry starburst mother plant
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now essentially in that plant,
theoretically, I can cut clones up here of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst and off this branch,
I can cut clones of Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like this listener is saying that we
could have multiple mother plants on one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because here in Colorado,
we are limited to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only have 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've only got enough mother plants to
where I can breed and still have room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got mother plant stock and those are
my mom's and then I've got a few more that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can breed to so that I've got six more
to work with or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to have six in veg and six
in flour if you've got a med card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the med card, you only get six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I've got my six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state offers me and the six through my
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am limited by numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to graft four or five different
strains to one plant, that would
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically increase my catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like that for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having a pot right there that I
know is a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pot right there is strawberry
starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks and feels like it takes way too
much time to be effective for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a very different path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it done very well, but I feel
like, so I'm doing a lot of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom plants are kept for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kept for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the time that it would take somebody
to graft a plant, I've probably already
[SPEAKER_00]: grown out that mother plant, cut a bunch
of clones off of it and then flowered the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant and started with the fresh
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I feel like eventually those,
I don't know that this is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those genetics will move
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my strawberry will start being orange
and whatever plant I grafted up here will
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like genetically somehow that's
not going to do what I need done for
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation of unique genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my hunch, my feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never read about that, but I don't
like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather have my own individual
mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great useful tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do this in apples is quite a common
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some apples grow very weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are really bad.
They're not as strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as strong as the trunks and
stalks of apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking out of my ass from things
I've heard on probably on public radios,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I think I heard this honestly NPR is
really where I think I heard this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main stock is good on some apple
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shitty on some, so they take a
fucking graft of one and they stick it
[SPEAKER_00]: right into that good root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've got a good trunk with 20
different kinds of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they'll plan it out to where this
branch is one kind that finishes early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This branch finishes a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one finishes later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one finishes at the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one tree is dropping fruit in a
spiral for the whole apple season,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really cool, really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run a big ass apple orchard,
that is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apples, they don't, I don't know if that
mixes in the apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple, are they as critical with their
apple varietals as they are cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you get a fucking granny Smith and
it tastes a little bit like a pink lady,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you fucking furious as a breeder who's
breeding with these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't run that sort of a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it as a personal project,
if it's your hobby, your medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't rely on that as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are buying the seeds that I make
from these grafted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't rely on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I've rambled on enough
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you some sort of a decent
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you come here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Smoke What, thank you for the Patreon
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Smoke What's message got rushed
up to the top of the email list because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those do help you out, patreon.com forward
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see you on here a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I see your name, I go Smoke
What.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I say it like that,
but I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in my head, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're renting space in my head for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behave in there, be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you again for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wraps it up with have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a high thought for the day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep having high thoughts and don't be shy
to send them my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of high thoughts too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them end up here on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says my friend Rasta Jeff with a
lot of A's and Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, first, let me tell you
that the grow from your heart podcast is
[SPEAKER_00]: the most positive vibes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most pleasant one to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be a positive upbeat dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sense in being negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough problems and bullshit going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put out some positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing weed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking dabs and growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to be mad about in this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that's why I finally got my wife
to help me becoming a Patreon member.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we finish the process,
I am really happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, some of this message is hard to
read and you'll understand here in just
[SPEAKER_00]: another paragraph, you'll get why some of
the words are broken up, but they finally
[SPEAKER_00]: got their wife to allow them to become a
patron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you to your wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a good wife behind every good
grower, we may just lose our fucking minds
[SPEAKER_00]: without somebody on our team keeping an
eye on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may just lose your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your whole house will be filled with
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd never take a shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things may go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am the Brazilian grower who
also happens to be blind who contacted you
[SPEAKER_00]: several weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so impressed with you being blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I acknowledged that you were
Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your English comes out pretty damn well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the language barrier to being blind,
but now also you're blind and Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a language barrier there and
you're doing amazingly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a blind friend who is
growing, who is also Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my name is they leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip their real name,
but it says, you can call me Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to read this on the podcast,
what up Brazil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, reading my email on the podcast
is not important for me, but if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: try to help me answering my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my friend, I liked your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing different strains from
different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They list the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to include that just to
keep, uh, protect the innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm growing them in a light depth
setup in which I have a veg and flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow with a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping, I'm growing them in a light
depth setup in which I have a veg and a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be doing this indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they mean a light depth
outdoors or a light depth indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make it work for them with
four plants in total and eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are around two and a half gallon
pots in feeding and soil feeding a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent homemade organic farts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the morning, I take my plants out of
the grows and I put them in the direct sun
[SPEAKER_00]: for a whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the end of the day, before the
sunset, I put back in the grow where they
[SPEAKER_00]: finish 17 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are in veg or 12, if they are in
flowering, the results have been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plants finish healthily with
the normal yellowing of the fan leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: between 10 to 30% brown trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like this person knows what
they're doing so far and they are blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you've ever thought I can't
do it, I'm not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not strong enough, smart enough,
fast enough, able enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think again, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is blind and they're fucking
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a blind grower can get up and run a
light depth, you can do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all do more than we think we're
capable of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this person as inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this person as a reason to wipe away
your fucking excuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash the sand out of your vag and let's
get moving and do some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blind guy is doing better than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do let that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blind guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, but I'm fucking, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no fucking excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's blind and he's killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be proud of you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it says the thing I don't understand,
and this is where it gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys so far, let's recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a great grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the plants are going outdoors during
the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get 17 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're in veg and 12 hours of light,
if they're in flower, uh, then they move,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get moved back indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers happy with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing normal, uh, yellowing of
fan leaves, which is normal fading and 10
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30% brown, which is probably amber
trichomes, which has gone the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to jump into the part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had nothing I found online about it is
why all my plants finish around 30% sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: than the breeders estimated flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the breeder says it finishes around 70
days of flowering, my plan will finish 21
[SPEAKER_00]: days sooner at about 49 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's amazing because usually a
breeder will lessen the time on the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, yeah, this takes eight weeks
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the breeder says eight, expect nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for you to get stuff that is quicker,
more quickly than finishing more quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: than the breeder says, Oh, that's really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's happening,
but we're going to keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says right now I'm flowering a Northern
lights from sensei seeds that the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time is supposed to be around 48
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the 28th day with all white
trichomes and the first one changing to
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm expecting to harvest in five days
time again, 30% ahead from indication of
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is leading to me, leading me to
believe that you may be harvesting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying you're satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's leave some of these plants to go
65.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try it 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cutting down way early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what happens if you let a plant
go at 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what happens if you go 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to know what happens if you
go 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what is causing your plants
to be finished 20 to 30 days earlier than
[SPEAKER_00]: they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have no problem with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my plants finished in 40 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 days, I would be ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the yields have been great and the
plants have, there's sticky pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants show no sign of stress,
but I want to understand what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they offer a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory is that it happens because I
give my plants about 10 hours of direct
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight and compliment that with extra
hours under the LED lamps of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants have lots of energy,
plenty of organic food, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerates their metabolism, making them
flower faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flowering quite quickly,
but it still takes time for trichomes to
[SPEAKER_00]: mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes have to amber out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to do, I don't know the proper
term for what happens inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to fucking happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that usually takes quite a bit of a
bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know about your theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't agree or disagree with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no way to disprove or prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think that the trichomes are
not as ready as you're thinking they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to let them go longer and
scope them and then compare your 30 day
[SPEAKER_00]: that you thought was ready to a 60 day or
a 50 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see if you're actually ready or
maybe even better send us some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send some photos of the trichomes,
if you can get them on your camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you yourself are blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking for photos from a blind guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, but you're awesome already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can get me on this email is this
email for a blind person from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email is better written.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better grammar, better English than a lot
of the people who are Americans who are
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to speak English who can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude is a bad motherfucker for
being blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a photo of some trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a photo of some plants that you
think are done at this early phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will give my honest opinion and we
will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are finishing this early,
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach us all how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud and excited for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think if we go a little bit
further, your plants will be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think that you're blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not to be disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you're misjudging the color
or if someone that's helping you is
[SPEAKER_00]: misjudging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you some guidance,
some friendly advice, help you out,
[SPEAKER_00]: use my gift of sight and see if we can
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me some pictures if you're able
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a scope that hooks up to my
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a Dino light scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about, it was a hundred bucks back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like 40 bucks now on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can order from Amazon, get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hooks up to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: B in my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold the buds in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the camera right against it and
focus it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will put the trichomes up on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the image up on my computer
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichome heads are this big around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps me out to see colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to identify pests and
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different things with that scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just fun to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be looking at your fingerprints and
how much shit's on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look and see how dirty the computer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll gross you out for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get a scope that you can hook up to
the computer, take a couple of shots,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot me the photos, and then we will be
the judge of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if your trichomes are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your permission, I will put those
trichomes up here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can screen share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get a survey going and see if we
think that your plants are as done as we
[SPEAKER_00]: believe they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, what we can do, we can correct
your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just going to say, ha ha,
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say what we need to do is
make adjustments and we'll make
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to see photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another paragraph I've got to
skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, finally, I just wanted to
send my positive vibrations to all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other blind growers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all the other blind
growers out there from our blind grower
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good hearing from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really curious about these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of input right now,
a lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough information and I hate
to assume that you're cutting too early,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is my first assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some feedback and maybe I can
give you more input.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got plenty of time for another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is great because it says,
what's good, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that starts a message with what's
good, baby, has got some funny,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking in from Oklahoma, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fixing to start up this commercial
facility in a small town after the first
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently running your blueberry
cookies S1 shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also known as Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm running it in my personal
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering where the podcast about
Leonardo is hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is even one out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to give you a holla and say,
I appreciate everything you have done and
[SPEAKER_00]: will do for this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot more tricks up my sleeve
for this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just fucking wait, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID's got us kind of slowed down,
but you know, can't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say it's people like you
that really have advanced the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community during its dark days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of people that came
before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am standing by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm standing on the shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a good foundation that I learned
from, so I've got to give them a shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for noticing that I'm trying
to carry this cannabis torch as hard as I
[SPEAKER_00]: can, as strongly as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I've been growing now
for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted my first seed at the age of 16
and I've said fuck it ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice rebellious attitude in this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I also wanted to show you love for
making true S1 form or S1s to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most breeders don't mess with S1s and it's
nice to have a grower of your
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put out quality genetics in true S1 form.
[SPEAKER_00]: S1 form, we've gone over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that I find a quality plant and
I simply reverse it and I take pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant, put that pollen on a clone of
the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we make seeds that are self.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will represent that plant very
strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put those out for people to
grow so they have very quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says don't stop bringing that fire,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says from Brody G and you can use
my name if this gets that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Brody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sending me the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: My feedback for Brody goes a lot like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, where am I with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down the word strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a podcast for the blueberry
cookies S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is under a episode called six strain
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's episode number 431 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, there is a playlist called Strain
[SPEAKER_00]: Descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that list of Strain Descriptions,
there is an episode called Strain Reviews
[SPEAKER_00]: aka TMNT.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you will find the blueberry
cookies also known as Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you will find that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 431 is where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did not talk real in depth about
that strain here on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will wrap up this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say the blueberry cookies
S1 is blueberry Tahoe cross to the thin
[SPEAKER_00]: mint cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that funky Girl Scout cookies
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say what I assume the cross is
on there, but it's got a real minty note
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, a pungent note to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to the blueberry Tahoe,
which obviously has blueberry notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry in there, kind of corrected
the funky growth of the Tahoe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it also gave more vigor to that
thin mint cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets kind of tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets kind of branchy, but for as tall
and branchy as it is, it really puts out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of harvest and it just fills up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant fills up with colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The S1s have a very common and uniform
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like a mean aggressive
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it would kick your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves have a nice shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're neither indica nor sativa looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of wider, sort of maple
leafy, but then they point in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell that the plant's going to
have some potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also change shape based on the VPD a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants will do that, but they're kind of
longer, more aggressive looking than a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal indica plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tall, but they're real sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need a lot of supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will hold themselves up most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make nice colas and giant tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lollipop them and bottom them up a
little bit, don't leave a lot of larv.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that goes right up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll fill in just giant, nice colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants can take abuse and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite part of the blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are like raspberry skittles or
blueberry nerds ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about those blue lollipops I used
to eat when I was a kid that would stain
[SPEAKER_00]: my mouth blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got gum in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue raspberry suckers makes your face
all blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it got called blue raspberry
truffle when I crossed it with other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that blue raspberry kind of a
face puckery sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always real sticky, super photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also take anything you throw at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can abuse this shit out of the
blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it too cold, too dry,
too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes, now we're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really get mad at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't interrupt the light cycle too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kind of, it'll slow down for you,
but it won't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just freak out, slow down,
but I could take feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overfeed it, underfeed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can abuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can knock it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bend it, twist it, crack it,
pop it, flip it up, rub it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, it'll take all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It loves abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about nine to 10 weeks to flower,
depending on, you know, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypically dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get the S ones, there is a little
variation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's going to depend on your room,
your lighting, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got about a nine to 10 week plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part is that no matter how good
of a grower, you can expect a pretty nice
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest out of it in nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't give you too much of a rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend doing some defoliation and
popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get kind of tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got short rooms, flower
early, if you want to spread it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: top it one time, it'll make one nice
apical dominant top, and then it'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where that one top,
if you cut that one, these other branches
[SPEAKER_00]: will compete and become the main,
the secondary main tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secondaries will become the main tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top it that one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make a gorgeous plant with a big
fat yield for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do them small,
do them in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go bigger, do them in a
seven, do top them, have some supports
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they'll get kind of top heavy toward
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top them out, but a pretty easy
plant to grow, takes a lot of feedings,
[SPEAKER_00]: takes abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take anything you throw at it and
it will be a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a more in-depth review on
those strains, again, check out episode
[SPEAKER_00]: number 431.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that covers up my,
I call it the blueberry cookies quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I covered the blueberry cookies
quickie real quick.
