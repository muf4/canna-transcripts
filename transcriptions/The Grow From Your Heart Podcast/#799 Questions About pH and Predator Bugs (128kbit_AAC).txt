[SPEAKER_01]: calm for all of that information Alright,
I feel like we've covered all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: business part here at the start of the
podcast I do have something I kind of want
[SPEAKER_01]: to segue into I'm not sure if you pay
attention to the news, but recently A man
[SPEAKER_01]: was executed in Singapore for possession
of 2.2 pounds of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A man was Executed for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that that is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that that is fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that is wrong I think that's
terrible being somebody who promotes
[SPEAKER_01]: advocates supports and thoroughly enjoys
cannabis This is fucking heartbreaking to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear that somebody was put to death for
possession of an herb That causes no harm
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion or experience and makes
people feel better in a recreational And a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical way this person is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had children They had a family and
this person is gone the government in
[SPEAKER_01]: their country decided that they needed to
kill this person for cannabis That is
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking crazy to me now another thing I
want to add to this and you'll see how
[SPEAKER_01]: they connect in just a moment is I was
talking to a friend who was recently
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling around the world and they went
to Australia and they found themselves in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia smoking a little bit of pot in
front of a bar Somebody walked up to them
[SPEAKER_01]: and said hey mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure they said hey mate,
but they're Australian So they probably
[SPEAKER_01]: did they said hey mate You can't smoke
that the cops are already on the way
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for you They smelled it down the
street and my friend said what that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't just smoke a joint in front of a bar
here And they said no you will go straight
[SPEAKER_01]: to jail for having cannabis with you here
So you've got to get rid of that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got to hide you've got to get rid of the
smell So my friend had to get rid of his
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to get rid of the cannabis He was
smoking he had to get rid of his stash and
[SPEAKER_01]: his accessories He had to go somewhere
make sure he didn't smell like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were looking for this person
where I am headed with this you guys I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend was from Colorado Don't forget
sometimes that it is not all Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not safe to travel everywhere with
cannabis It is not safe to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis openly everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to keep your heads up You've
got to learn about the rules the laws the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations before you go somewhere and
find out what type of risk you're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself in if you do travel with cannabis
or consume or acquire cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_01]: foreign or strange land it could be a
different state if I'm going to a
[SPEAKER_01]: different state I do research before I go
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I take cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if I do take cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if I take concentrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of trouble am I going to get
into if I get caught with a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: joints?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of trouble do I get into if I
get caught with a couple grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of trouble do I get into for
traveling with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all of that research if I'm going to
a state next to me a few states over if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm flying somewhere I think about all of
that stuff before I travel do extra
[SPEAKER_01]: research on that if you are traveling
abroad going to another country with
[SPEAKER_01]: different laws rules and regulations
whatever you think works here may not work
[SPEAKER_01]: there things are different in other
countries and once you're in their country
[SPEAKER_01]: you are under their laws you've got to
follow their laws you may be a privileged
[SPEAKER_01]: person here you may not fit a certain
criteria here where you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: searched and hassled in another country
you're probably exactly who they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to search and hassle so my point of this
is somebody has been executed for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in another country a person I know was
almost arrested and given a really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: time for consuming cannabis just a little
tiny bit of cannabis outside of a bar in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia my point here is be very careful
you guys I don't want you to get put in a
[SPEAKER_01]: foreign jail where we'll never hear from
you again dude they're gonna feed you
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible food and treat you like shit
forever because you're an American in a
[SPEAKER_01]: foreign prison in a foreign jail good luck
with that and I definitely don't want you
[SPEAKER_01]: executed for enjoying our favorite plant
don't be a statistic in another country I
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's fun to smoke it's fun to get
high and enter at your own risk but I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: saying understand the risk and be as
careful as possible all right that's
[SPEAKER_01]: enough of the news talk I wanted to cover
today let's segue into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and cannabis questions portion
of this podcast I do have a lot of great
[SPEAKER_01]: questions that I do want to answer this
question that I'm about to read did come
[SPEAKER_01]: from did come from the grow help tab on I
read genetics calm that was harder to say
[SPEAKER_01]: than it looked if you go to I read
genetics calm there's a row of tabs on the
[SPEAKER_01]: top one of them says questions or grow
help if you click on that tab you will be
[SPEAKER_01]: given the opportunity to fill out to fill
out a questionnaire asking about your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden then at the end you are given the
opportunity to ask a grow question this
[SPEAKER_01]: grow question came from our friend Polly
two fingers said what kind of question do
[SPEAKER_01]: you have it is a general grow question the
question from Polly two fingers goes a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: like this it says what's up Rasta Jeff
what's up Polly good to meet you bro it
[SPEAKER_01]: says I love your podcast thank you bro cuz
I love you too it says seriously it is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the best for real knowledge I
appreciate that thank you says not just
[SPEAKER_01]: bro science some of it is bro science but
it's also I've got a lot of experience so
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I can talk from experience I
read a lot and then there are is some bro
[SPEAKER_01]: science mixed in it says it's actually
quite quality info thank you brother I do
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate that I try hard to give you
real reliable accurate info I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are gonna use the advice that I
give you in your garden and I would feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like a real a terrible person if you
messed up your garden based on the advice
[SPEAKER_01]: that I give you I'm I try to be better
than that so it goes on it says my
[SPEAKER_01]: question is this this is a really good
question here also why why oh why does my
[SPEAKER_01]: pH drift in my reservoir that's a really
good very common question I've got a good
[SPEAKER_01]: logical explanation but let's go a little
final product it will it goes on it says
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at getting a blue lab pH
controller with the pump to keep it dialed
[SPEAKER_01]: in any help is greatly appreciated from
your friend Polly two fingers Polly I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a really great really logical really
rational explanation for what I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening here in your grow why your pH is
rising this could be a reservoir for
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics this could be a reservoir for
an auto watering system it could be an ebb
[SPEAKER_01]: and flow table it could be a drain to
waste table I don't know exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got set up but I imagine a large
reservoir and from that reservoir water
[SPEAKER_01]: will be pumped out of that into your
plants over time there will be evaporation
[SPEAKER_01]: right though you want the water is going
to evaporate from that vessel from your
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir so the water level is going to
go down but as that water evaporates guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens the salts from your bottled
nutrients do not evaporate so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more concentrated you'll also
notice if you measure the pH of the EC it
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably slightly rising as well
because water has evaporated and none of
[SPEAKER_01]: the salts that you have added to that
water are leaving they're solids they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not leaving so the water is up in the air
now it's up in there is vapor it's
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming clouds it's becoming rain it's
becoming humidity it's a problem in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow maybe it's sucked right back up into
the dehumidifier but those nutrients are
[SPEAKER_01]: still right there in your reservoir so
you've got less water they might be very
[SPEAKER_01]: minute difference amount of water but it
can make a big difference in the pH in the
[SPEAKER_01]: EC so you got a little bit less water and
you haven't reduced the amount of salts so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna make the EC go up and the pH
are going up because it doesn't seem like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're losing a lot of water but over a
couple of days you're probably evaporating
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of water especially if you've
got bubbles in there because the bubbles
[SPEAKER_01]: are adding a lot of oxygen to that and
putting the the water into the air and
[SPEAKER_01]: giving it more opportunity to become a
vapor and humidity into the room so what I
[SPEAKER_01]: really think is happening here is just the
water is evaporating it's making your pH
[SPEAKER_01]: rise because there's still salts remaining
there's less water the ratio has changed
[SPEAKER_01]: that's throwing off your pH the way to fix
that is just keep monitoring that pH and
[SPEAKER_01]: if it gets lower out of your range add a
little bit of water and that water should
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the pH down right where you wanted
it you may need to add a little bit of pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down that may also be the solution maybe
consider checking the EC or the PPMs while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing this they may need to be
adjusted as well all right my friend Polly
[SPEAKER_01]: two fingers I feel like I've answered your
question thank you for the great question
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the best part my dude since I read

[SPEAKER_01]: give them a proofread and say this show
next show this show next show that's as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as I go let's stay focused because
I've got another one for this show the
[SPEAKER_01]: next message on this episode came from our
friend Dave skylark big shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy Dave skylark thank you for the great
message this one did come from the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: help tab so my buddy Dave you do win a
free pack of iri genetic seeds sponsored
[SPEAKER_01]: by our friends at seeds here now calm
please do send me your mailing address I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be happy to send you out a package of
seeds this question goes a lot like this
[SPEAKER_01]: it says yo rasta Jeff I hope you are doing
amazing I feel like I'm doing quite well
[SPEAKER_01]: bro thank you for asking says I definitely
look forward to testing out the many
[SPEAKER_01]: strains you offer I am a huge sativa fan
oh you're definitely going to enjoy my
[SPEAKER_01]: products if you like sativa's I like that
head wrecking head trip and buzz if I if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can walk into target and not have a panic
attack I did not get high enough before we
[SPEAKER_01]: went into target I need to go take a
couple of more dabs but let's stay focused
[SPEAKER_01]: which is hard for me today it says I'm
just curious what are your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: predator bugs versus chemical or organic
sprays for when pests show up possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors I haven't ran into pests yet but
it's best to be prepared yes because now
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've said you have not ran into
pests guess what they're coming you've
[SPEAKER_01]: invited them by saying that it goes on it
says I would love to hear this on an
[SPEAKER_01]: episode of the podcast well here you go
bro it is on the podcast it is happening
[SPEAKER_01]: bro it wraps it up with thank you so much
my buddy Dave skylark thank you so much
[SPEAKER_01]: for the great question this is a very good
question how do I feel about predator bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: versus chemical or organic sprays indoors
I actually use a combination of sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide applications and predator
insects in a commercial grow environment I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do it as much in a personal grow
because there's not as much as much at
[SPEAKER_01]: stake in a personal grow in a commercial
grow there are millions of dollars at risk
[SPEAKER_01]: at stake per harvest and a personal grow
it's not as much and the the predator bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: get a little bit expensive the budget is
better for the commercial grow it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it more worthwhile let's me delve
into what I'm talking about here in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial grow I like to start with spray
applications just basic sprays evergreen
[SPEAKER_01]: or what's the other one that I like to use
in the commercial grow evergreens my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite go-to most of the time for a
preventative I probably talk about that
[SPEAKER_01]: one a lot as a trawl I think is still
allowed in the commercial grow environment
[SPEAKER_01]: venerate is still allowed I like to use
products like that it's just a basic inner
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation for my basic integrated pest
management system and we're gonna talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot about pest management in another
future episode I'm gonna do a full episode
[SPEAKER_01]: about it but I like to spray those
products through veg I like to spray those
[SPEAKER_01]: products right at the beginning of flower
but as soon as I have flower formations I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to apply any more sprayed
pesticides I don't want to mess up the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers in any way I don't want to slow
down their growth I don't want to mess up
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor I don't want to do any damage
to those flowers once they start
[SPEAKER_01]: developing I just want big fat healthy
flower clusters so I need some way to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs from attacking that grow once I stop
using those spray applications because
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the grows that I work with in the
Colorado area they're in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: basically the middle of the desert and
there are bugs out there and there are
[SPEAKER_01]: bushes out there and we can't we can only
do so much of the outside environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: the building is only so sealed so bugs are
able to get in so I've got to do things to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure they cannot get to my plants so
once I have hit the threshold that I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like my plants are too beefy and too
chunky to apply a spray pesticide that is
[SPEAKER_01]: when I begin to release large batches of
predator insects there's a very large
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of predator insects you can
release in a cultivation facility to
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate bugs eradicate bugs keep bugs at
bay you can get rid of almost any insect
[SPEAKER_01]: with other insects you just may have to be
aggressive about it it's all about a
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers game also just like pesticides
it's just as important when I use a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide my first question is what bugs
are we trying to attack what pest is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming what am I spraying for because if
you're fighting guys with ak-47s you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to send in karate guys that's not
going to work you got to send in guys with
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking missile launchers to take them out
you've got to know what you're battling so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can win the same thing applies
for attacking a pest problem with another
[SPEAKER_01]: pest you need the appropriate pest so you
have to do your research on that part also
[SPEAKER_01]: it is very environmental and regionally
dependent some pests some of your predator
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs will not stick around if your
humidity is too high or too low some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the predators will not stick around if the
temperature is too high or too low so
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to find the bugs that work for
your environment and attack the pest you
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to eradicate now to some people
it may sound crazy that I'm going to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays and then release bugs but I'm going
to time it properly I'm going to spray all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way up to about day 10 of flower and
then I'm going to stop spraying then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do a heavy defoliation one last
time and we're going to order the insects
[SPEAKER_01]: the bugs will show up about day 14 or 15
then we'll release all of those bugs by
[SPEAKER_01]: this time all of the sprayed pesticide
applications have broken down they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: broken down by the light by the wind and
they are no longer going to be a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: for the incoming predator bugs so I will
spray all through veg once or twice a week
[SPEAKER_01]: if I see I spray once a week no matter
what and then if I see a problem we step
[SPEAKER_01]: it up we spray twice a week if I still see
problems then I really need to step my
[SPEAKER_01]: shit up because I am failing twice a week
should get the job done no matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs I'm facing then I will taper off the
sprays if I don't see any problems as we
[SPEAKER_01]: go into flower taper off the sprays do
another defoliation and release the
[SPEAKER_01]: predator bugs those bugs are going to work
like an army like security guards they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get in there hungry when they
come in the mail they are hungry bro when
[SPEAKER_01]: those bugs show up they are ready to
fucking go so release those strategically
[SPEAKER_01]: spread them out through the canopy if
you've got a hot spot of bugs you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get rid of focus some of your
bugs on that hot spot and get rid of those
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs they will come in they will start
eating the shit out of the bad guys they
[SPEAKER_01]: will take over they will colonize and then
once all of your pests are gone basically
[SPEAKER_01]: all of your good bugs will die too if they
don't have a food source you can feed them
[SPEAKER_01]: if you like or you can let them dwindle
off and die a lot of times if we have
[SPEAKER_01]: extra bugs from the flower rooms I will go
put some of those in the mom room because
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that the mother room is where
it all starts if you don't have healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: moms you can't have healthy clones then
you can't have healthy veg you'll never
[SPEAKER_01]: have healthy flowers so I'll go spread
some of those in the mom room just to give
[SPEAKER_01]: that mom room a little bonus get some
predator bugs in there and that way
[SPEAKER_01]: they're already started they're colonizing
in there and we can move them around yes
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps a lot of them are going to get
destroyed by pesticide applications in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future but they're like little backup
guardians for the time that they do
[SPEAKER_01]: survive all right my friend Dave skylark
thank you for the great question I do
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it my method use those sprayed
applications right up till the last minute
[SPEAKER_01]: then switch to those bugs if you do want
to use bugs the whole way let me talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about that you definitely can use predator
bugs the entire time through the growth
[SPEAKER_01]: site through the growth cycle if you don't
want to add spray applications and there
[SPEAKER_01]: are some spray applications that will not
harm beneficial insects they'll keep some
[SPEAKER_01]: of your your beneficial predator bugs
around you do need to do the research on
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you're going to spray something
read will it kill hypoaspis miles will it
[SPEAKER_01]: kill green lace wings see because some of
your applications are only going to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: the insects that bite into the leaf and
some of these guys don't bite into the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf they just crawl around on it so you
may be able to spray some applications
[SPEAKER_01]: even after you do release the predators
once again you'll have to do your research
[SPEAKER_01]: for specific predators and specific sprays
but you definitely can use the predator
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs through the entire duration of the
grow once again I will list
[SPEAKER_01]: off some more because I think I went
through them quite quickly a moment
[SPEAKER_01]: away the ladybugs are really cool for
about 30 minutes you get them in there
[SPEAKER_01]: take a bunch of photos our ladybugs cool
they're everywhere and then the next day
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells like shit because they stink so
bad you walk into the grow and it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're walking on crunchy popcorn
because there's dead ladybugs on the floor
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're just you're just busting them
I don't like the ladybugs I think I made
[SPEAKER_01]: my point on that I'm Rasta Jeff and I vote
no on ladybugs and the grow use a more
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive predator that's my stance on
shit all right where are we on time I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we've got time for one more question
here also did I say this already my dude
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave skylark yes I said this please do
reach out because I owe you a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: iry genetics seeds all right this next
message once again came from the contact
[SPEAKER_01]: form submission on iry direct this one
came from our friend Greg big shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: my buddy Greg I don't know if you want
your full name set here buddy you wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: your full name I'm just gonna call you
Greg today big shout out to my buddy Greg
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg says I want to know what strains you
have that are powdery mildew resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a really good question a lot of
people are going to be growing outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: this year a lot of people on the coastal
areas are always looking for that mold and
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew resistant strain a lot of people
have been asking me this lately because
[SPEAKER_01]: they are going outdoors I have got some
recommendations for you have no fear Rasta
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff has got answers one of the strains I
can recommend to you that has been proven
[SPEAKER_01]: to be very resistant to powdery mildew in
indoor and outdoor environments is morning
[SPEAKER_01]: dew morning dew is one of my favorite
strains that is a grateful dog pollinated
[SPEAKER_01]: by an arise plant I made both of those
plants and then I bred them together so
[SPEAKER_01]: that is one of my favorite creations the
morning dew makes a kind of a skunky
[SPEAKER_01]: chemically cushy sort of aromas and
flavors with a really nice buzz so that
[SPEAKER_01]: one is morning dew that one is going to be
very powdery mildew resistant the next one
[SPEAKER_01]: is character zero character zero is an
afterglow cross a lot of the afterglow
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses that I made about a year ago those
crosses are all very powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant but some of the standout crosses
in that lineup where the character zero
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Sunday show those are both very
powdery mildew resistant those both have a
[SPEAKER_01]: very specific very special plant in there
which is a Nigerian cross to an Afghani
[SPEAKER_01]: cross to a Nepali why I'm surprised and
glad that I remembered all of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that comes from that plant that
is crossed to that plant does make very
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew resistant plants so that
plant was crossed to the afterglow that
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant was also crossed to the fire OG
and then crossed to the afterglow both of
[SPEAKER_01]: those offspring create very powdery mildew
resistant plants and once again those are
[SPEAKER_01]: the zero character zero and Sunday show
I've got one more for you that we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk about here that is very powdery
mildew resistant and that one is called
[SPEAKER_01]: fist bump fist bump is sour diesel to
arise that one is super stinky that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: a super sour diesel chemical dirty feet
sort of a funky thing to it and the buzz
[SPEAKER_01]: on it is amazing it'll make your eyes nice
and heavy make you nice and red-eyed give
[SPEAKER_01]: you that old-school cotton mouth and the
flavor is just right so some options for
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew resistant strains from my
lineup I would say morning dew morning dew
[SPEAKER_01]: is regular seeds by the way male female
seeds the character zero and Sunday show
[SPEAKER_01]: are two more recommendations those are
feminized seeds and my final
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation for you was fist bump and
