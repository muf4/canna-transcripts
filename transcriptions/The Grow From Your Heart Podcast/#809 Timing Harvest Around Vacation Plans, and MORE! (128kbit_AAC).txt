[SPEAKER_00]: I do know I owe a couple of people some
free seeds still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all the love and
support and great feedback and comments
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been leaving on the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many great comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every comment has been positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys keep the conversation going down
there in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so positive to see good
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great messages here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this message came from the Grow
Help tab on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a new friend that I
recently met in the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not put a name which you want said
on here, so I will not say a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know who you are when you hear
the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from the Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to iregenetics.com, there will
be a tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Grow Help or Grow Questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in your Grow Question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, that means that you win a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question came from my new friend
who I also met on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey my new friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure and an honor to meet
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your vacation goes well,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope this email finds you ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a beautiful day, a beautiful
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been an avid listener for
about a year now, and I finally have a
[SPEAKER_00]: question I feel would be worth an email
and maybe even to read on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was a great question and a
timely question as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I should mention that part of the
font got cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the words here at the end of
the sentences are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why my printer made new
margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology got me this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to blame it on the printer,
but I'm going to do my best to read the
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Shout out to you and the
iREDirect Discord Grommies for always
[SPEAKER_00]: being so generous with your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we are there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make everybody the best
grower that we can all be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great time to have you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else, if you're not on the
Discord server, come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link in the show notes and
in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good time over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're testing my seeds,
please do post those on the Discord
[SPEAKER_00]: server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting myself way lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I credit you all for so much of
my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention answering a bunch of
questions that have helped me out through
[SPEAKER_00]: this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that we were able to help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we found you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says, for my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm glad somebody brought this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, This is my first iRerun ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for growing my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, You've got quite a beautiful
variety there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm currently 41 days into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was received quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are probably, by the time I'm reading
this, by the time this comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be about 55 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I estimate by the time this comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little behind on the recording
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already had shows planned and scheduled
and recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if I haven't read your message,
have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do as many as I can in a show and
I'm recording ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your message may have already been
read, just not put on the podcast yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not have put it up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back into this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a long question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't get focused here, it says,
um, so they're about day.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's about day 55 ish into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I tend to the garden while I'm
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leaves me with limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there is part of this cutoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some part of the sentence is cut off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I said, my printer went wonky on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know the situation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it says, I plan to go on
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I have no one to tend the garden
while I am away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leaves me with limited options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that's what it's meant to say,
just based on a conversation we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I would hate to cut the girls
down early, but I would also hate to have
[SPEAKER_00]: issues while I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then it's cut off, but then it goes on
with should I, and this is where they
[SPEAKER_00]: present a few options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this when somebody has already done
some thinking, put some thought into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want a little bit of
reaffirmation, encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinforcement on what they're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so the options that our friend has
come up with on their own says,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, should I harvest early and turn my
bedroom into a moist fridge for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're going on vacation very
soon, I don't know exactly when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving, but I remember based on our,
our, uh, conversation on discord that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was thinking this was not the option
you're going to leave way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you chop them down before you leave,
uh, you're just cutting down plants way
[SPEAKER_00]: too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather do one of the options I see
later on the list because that way we do
[SPEAKER_00]: at least get an option for success at this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we cut them down this early,
uh, you've still got somewhere between 12
[SPEAKER_00]: and 20 days to go by the time this episode
comes out and you're going to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, uh, these plants will
not, if you cut them down early,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will not be worth a shit in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would rather, uh, you've already
wasted veg time and you've wasted 55 days
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means, uh, electricity, nutrients,
also possibly felonies based on your
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly where you are in the
rules there, but um, you've already gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not cut it down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is our option, it says I can also
even harvest earlier and try to dry it
[SPEAKER_00]: before I leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's cutting you down like another
10 to 14 days even earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I still don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this option that you came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one says, should I water the day
before I leave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I read this, I got excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, water the day before I leave,
let the 12, 12 light schedule continue for
[SPEAKER_00]: a week, then have them scheduled to turn
off and start the plants drying in
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then of course it does cut off
part of the damn sentence here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I understand what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let the plants dry whole darkness for
two weeks while I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 60, uh, 60% relative humidity and 60
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is, that is probably what I would
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would even, this may sound weird because
I preach a lot of opposite stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to make this crop even more
successful, to stretch out your watering
[SPEAKER_00]: time and prolong the life of these plants
while you're gone and make this plan work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water them the day before you're
like right as late as possible before you
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the very last option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like to put larger saucers under my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing in a three gallon pot,
I'll put a five gallon, like a saucer that
[SPEAKER_00]: would normally go under a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll water the plant heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will overwater it until that saucer
is completely full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the, uh, the soil or medium is
completely saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got that tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath it, which is also saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll just keep waking up into that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a couple of days out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, depending on the size of the
original pot and the size of the backup
[SPEAKER_00]: water, people are going to say,
you're going to overwater and drown the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if they're big established plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're big enough, this won't be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of them is down in the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top part will dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get plenty of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would water them right before you
leave, overwater them a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: put those big saucers under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip the lights to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would put them on 11 hours on and 13
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I preach a lot of different things,
but in this situation, this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this will do is this will extend your
water that is in those pots by just maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even a day, maybe two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that water there as long as you
can get it at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to buy you over six days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's six days less light that you're
getting to these plants that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: create humidity and heat in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make the plants drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is going to go away,
is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe consider going to 11 hours on and
13 hours off to extend that water in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short has taught us to turn the lights
to 1113 a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work for a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do preach an opposite technique,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both do have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time it is a pro for the 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says water them the day before I leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip the light schedule to 1113 is what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then yeah, then you're going to have a lot
of at least a week of them getting watered
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five, maybe six or seven days,
depending on, again, I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions in the room, the amount of
soil, the size of pots, but you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get four, maybe five, maybe seven,
maybe 10 days worth of water out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while you're gone, the plants will
run out of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to slowly die on the
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that could be probably your best
option, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're not going to cut them down
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does sound sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are going to look like shit
when you come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to look a little bit
funky, but you're not growing for leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing for harvestable,
smokable buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're going to do anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to let the plant grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to cut it down and hang it
upside down until it died.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to let it do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it stick curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I may have invented something
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I just I had I poorly timed some
shit and I didn't have a dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let this room flower and then there's
other shit in my dry and cure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I'll just let that
plant fucking stay in there and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, and it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant definitely did die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just went and cut the leaves
off of it and we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dried it, cured it and smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it stick curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already started drying on the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weed got us really, really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quality weed for what it had to go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather you have this weed that
goes a little bit long and gets dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of falls apart and the leaves already
fall off of it by the time you get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then cut down something that's just fluffy
dandelions, not even fully formed buds
[SPEAKER_00]: worth looking at, worth smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I think this would be a better
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, stick cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water that shit right before you leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll die while you're gone, depending on
how long you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't imagine you're gone for more
than two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 17 days is what most people go out
of town for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think it'll dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start to get a little bit crispy by
the time you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come home, leave it standing and
pull off all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf that is still on there,
just take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to put some supports in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get some stakes, some sticks,
because as they die, they may start
[SPEAKER_00]: tipping over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stake them up if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your best bet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some support, but water the shit
out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out of town, set your conditions to go
off in about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that light go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it cook for a week with no lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put a camera in there and watch
it, that wouldn't be a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a cheap camera on Amazon that
you can open up on your phone while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in Italy and you can look and see like,
are the plants, are the leaves up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they all the way down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they yellow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they brown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they falling off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can decide how to adjust that
timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your timer is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got timers that attach to my phone
and all kinds of other shit, so maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: can adjust to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can go home when you get back,
pull off all those leaves, then chop them,
[SPEAKER_00]: then dry and cure and harvest as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be a little bit dry already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a little bit ahead of
yourself, especially in that 60-60 room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are questions with the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is it possible to trigger
self-seeding if the whole plant is left in
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness for too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything is possible, but I don't think
it's going to happen within that week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does happen, the seed won't have any
time to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to cut it down before that
seed even does anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes six to eight weeks to make a seed
fully form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with just a few days, you're not going
to have much there to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt that it will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is more likely, more common if you
were to leave the light on too long and
[SPEAKER_00]: let it flower too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the dark will kind of actually may
help you prevent that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, anything is fucking
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cannabis plants and nature does
find a way is another thing I always say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I think you'll be just fine
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I haven't thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I think you've got the right
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a very intelligent person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem to think things through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The team gave you a lot of feedback and
input the day that we were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to make it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you just go have fun on your
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have accidentally said where you're
going here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did, I'll try to bleep it,
but go have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your self.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the sights, eat the food, meet the
people, see the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, let me know how my girls look
when you feel I looked at the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have a little ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are all longer finishers than
a lot of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it said, we'd love to know your
thoughts yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your house is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw your video on the discord there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of grow details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the grow details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a strategy is what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed if you had some way to auto
water these plants, that would be all the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow details I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like we answered the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a beautiful time on your
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see this episode before you go,
join us on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I hope to see some pictures and
details of the trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get back, jump in the discord and
let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also let me know how the plants look when
you came back and also let me know what
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy you chose to go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll hear this podcast while
you're on the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be really awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've already left, I try to time it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I will send you a free pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can wait until you get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me your address when you do return
from your vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get you a free pack of iry genetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're running some iry now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be an honor to get you some more iry
gear that you could run without an
[SPEAKER_00]: interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't get my shit focused up,
I've got another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also did come from the grow help
tab on the iry genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if I read your message on the
show, you will get a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow question,
please go to irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that grow help tab, type in your
question, hit send.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I read it on the show, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, you will get some
[SPEAKER_00]: free iry genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend Billy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy, you win seeds, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me your shipping address
because I want to send you a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says I just finished a small
breeding project with your gear and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I hit a golden goat leaning pheno
of shredder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's fucking awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shredder is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's goat leaning with orange,
gazum, pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got you've got blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got golden goat times two in there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a vigorous,
potent and terpy freaking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good mix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says I only got five seeds,
but they are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sent me a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds look like small marbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are gigantic ganja seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, have you ever seen seeds this big
from either parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: The true answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the golden goat back cross seeds
come out very huge and you've got golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat in here twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're putting a lot of that golden goat
vigor in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that probably is a golden goat trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the blueberry cookies makes giant
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the blueberry butcher and
blue raspberry truffle seeds are all huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, yeah, those seeds are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the where's the blueberry via the
golden goat shredder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, just making sure over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make so many things you guys I get
confused with the blueberry cookies does
[SPEAKER_00]: make giant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there was a lot of potential for
gigantic seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the opposite, anything I cross with the
Durban poison makes little tiny seeds most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a variation that's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes when I do the Durban poison
outside, I get bigger seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way that science and nature
want to play together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I can't freaking wait to pop these
for the next grow, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a winner, maybe name it
something cool and send me a fucking cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the bad Ninja Turtle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember there was a Ninja Turtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made one that was like their cousin
and he came out with fangs and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was still a turtle, but he was kind of
wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a snapping turtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name it that, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says for size comparison, that is a
shredder seed next to one of the dinosaur
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were giant, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were big seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said I can't wait to see what sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also be running some table seeds as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you had a great fourth, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fourth was excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see pictures of the table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going, what are table seeds,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not been following along for a
long time, I do put out a product I call
[SPEAKER_00]: table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I sit at my desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I sit right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I got another cozy location with
a chair where I will package up seeds all
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll spend all day just getting a jar of
seeds or a bag of seeds or a bin of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and putting those into packs of either
five, six, 12, 50, depends on what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just package up seeds all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I'm done, I will discover
that maybe like right along here along the
[SPEAKER_00]: iPad stand or maybe along here by the
microphone stand, I dropped a few seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they are because I may
have worked with multiple batches of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day and I do not have
confidence to say that these seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever seeds they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mislabel them,
sell them to you and you get something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not what you purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in a bin and I call them table
seeds, just seeds that I picked up off the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm not sure what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I package them up in just different
batches depending on what I'm in the mood
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's 10 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's 15 or 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw a few in a bag and then we sell them
on the website for a very low price so
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody can get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what they are but it could
be anything from the iRegenetics lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be it could be orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be mac one to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be jack the ripper to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a rise f2 news.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything that I've had on the
table within the past amount of time which
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be unreleased shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be pre-release of things that
will come out in the future but you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's in that bag because it's just
shit that I scooped up off the table and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't I don't scoop them up like these
from today's batch go into a pack of table
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go all into one jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one little section of table
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shake it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a big bag of it's like a jelly
bean bag there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what flavor you're going to
pull out when you grow those bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure that I've recovered all
read all of this that I've covered all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I feel like they are so big is
what we're going to call hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet those seeds are going to be
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to make giant plants that
grow super fast and I'm sure you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have some crazy amazing turps come out
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry cookies makes this like
tangy fruity sour funky turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy of course is oranges
and funk and then you got that golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: in there to give you that tropical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those plants are vigorous and super
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is going to be a winner bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea to cross that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it goes super well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see how it goes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also my dude please send me your address
because I do owe you that free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let's keep this party moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more question here right in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who wants to
be called Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do owe you a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again please send me your shipping
address.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys when you send me your address
please do put a real name on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to send to like Bill's ganja
farm or fucking weed smoker 5000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a real name on there please.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes me feel more comfortable
packaging up your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says in regards to cocoa and perlite
mix versus a peat and perlite mix what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the main difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a major difference there that I
can notice right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to grab a scoop of let's start
with the peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just reach into a bag and grab a
scoop of peat that is going to be a spongy
[SPEAKER_00]: gooey moist organic feeling substance in
there kind of like you got some some earth
[SPEAKER_00]: some foliage some it's kind of like
grabbing a sponge it's got that spongy
[SPEAKER_00]: texture to it when you squeeze it it'll
fluff back up it'll squeeze it's soft it's
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy it's got that organic feel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite on the other hand is like grabbing
a glass grabbing a handful of small glass
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really light for its volume so it
takes up a lot of space and provides air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peat will suck up water and hold in
water and not provide any air space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I use the perlite and a cocoa
mix is to put some separation in the cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough oxygen in there so I'll
put at least 30 perlite in a mix of cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it fluffier make it a little bit
more oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I feel like when I water all that
cocoa it's going to compress it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: compact all of the oxygen gets pushed out
of the top the roots get squished in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those roots strive more
strongly if I put some perlite in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow just less crushing space and put
some air in there I think that that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: works best for me so that's what I do
that's the main difference in a perlite
[SPEAKER_00]: and peat mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on it says can you use microbes in
both yes absolutely you definitely can and
[SPEAKER_00]: should use microbes in both of those
mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right the last part of this question
does say are there any pros and cons
[SPEAKER_00]: versus cocoa versus peat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I think if you do the peat in there
it's a different texture different
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency than the cocoa it holds water
differently it's got a different porosity
[SPEAKER_00]: is that even a word we're gonna make that
a word now ding that's the word of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: but it holds water so you're going to have
inconsistent water spots you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: some spots that are more dry some that are
more wet in your container and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like that I'd rather have smooth even
consistency wet all the way down this way
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer up toward the top that's just how it
works that's what I'd rather have other
[SPEAKER_00]: than pockets of peat over here that are
more wet than the cocoa that's over here I
[SPEAKER_00]: just that's not what I would prefer so the
pros and cons are just more consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: watering more consistent watering inside
the rhizosphere and more consistent wet
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry times you're gonna get more dry
back time with the cocoa also I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: you get better airflow and better root
development if you put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite in there a minute ago I did say
that I like to do approximately 30 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite if I had my way I would do
probably somewhere between 20 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite and 10 to 15 percent persilite the
bigger one the chunkier one just to put
[SPEAKER_00]: some chunks in there then we would do a
whole bunch of the cocoa I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me about 70 to 65 percent cocoa left
then while I'm making that mix I would put
[SPEAKER_00]: a big scoop of Azos in there give myself
some microbes to get started then we would
[SPEAKER_00]: plant into that my dude Owen thank you for
the great question please once again do
[SPEAKER_00]: send me your shipping address because I
owe you a free pack of iri genetics seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies and gentlemen if you have sent me a
question please do not feel discouraged if
