professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's

[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to cat coot and the entire
mystic roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody had a safe four 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody got super red eyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was checking out my stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I smoked about 14 grams of hash
and ate about 2,500 milligrams of edibles
[SPEAKER_02]: over the four 20 celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my eyes were a little bit red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a thousand milligrams on four 20 and
I woke up on four 21 having to peel my
[SPEAKER_02]: eyes open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys got super high because
this is a great episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am joined by my good buddy Kabuki J Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk a little bit about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also white Mike was on the show,
but he had to run halfway through the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is a really long podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to ramble on too long,
so I'm going to let the music play for a
[SPEAKER_02]: second and we get back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be joined by white Mike and Kabuki
J Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take a fat dab, sit tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking terrible at rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting at the table with our good
buddy white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also sitting across from me, welcome to my
house, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting across from me at the table is
Kabuki J Fox from run CBD slash Fox
[SPEAKER_02]: tracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the humble abode, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to finally be here neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's great to have you here,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in Pueblo now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's good to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to have both of you guys here
on the podcast at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called you white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never going to be white Mike forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell like who listens,
who knows me strictly from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's like, that's where that name
exists for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just came out as white Mike on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mike for life for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag white Mike for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting some echo.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that echo from?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are not sound guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I asked anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cause we turned up the bass on Mike
cause Mike's got a head cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you get well bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kabuki's over here rolling a blunt and
Mike was quite impressed by your rolling
[SPEAKER_02]: skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a bunch of dry sift frozen on my
fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like tearing the leaves apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I'll do a better job.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome to the show you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the episode after 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a little bit of a 420
recap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about where everybody was,
what they all did on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about some
bullshit that happened on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, what'd you do on 420, my friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really low key 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the day off, but I also don't have
childcare that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hung out with the kid until about
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran around town and picked up a whole
bunch of marijuana products that don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: you high and ran those up to a friend in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to your friend in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we are able to take good care of
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag fuck cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your CBD, your 420 was spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you may have to excuse us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be some stutters and some
stumbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some randomness in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many giant dabs have been taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many giant dabs have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: A relatively small amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short amount of time, lots of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two emails on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a beautiful rig from our friends
at Bear Mountain Studios.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Evan and Cass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to those kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met them at the cannabis cup a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike hung out with the kid on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask Kabuki what he did,
but he's taken a glob over here of some
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have to give him a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a week's worth of Mike dabs
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to clear this head hold up and
give him a variety of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen what happens when we give Mike
too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He turns different colors, has to run to
the bathroom and hide for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's nice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will grab one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend Kabuki, what did you do on
420, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: My 420 was pretty low key-ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my girl's mom was in town,
so we just kind of kicked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was your girl's mom a smoker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she's totally pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to moms that smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to moms that support cannabis,
even if they don't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then I sponsored the 5280 glass
showcase, which was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I heard, it went on pretty long,
from like four to midnight, and I caught
[SPEAKER_03]: it towards the end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed up at eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was that happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: At Native Hotel in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: N-A-T-I-V.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and it was cool how they handled that
because they had two buses outside where
[SPEAKER_03]: any dabbing or smoking or any consumption
was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, though obviously we couldn't do
anything in the hotel, they had made space
[SPEAKER_03]: and a counter for people that were getting
medicated, and they weren't fucked with it
[SPEAKER_03]: all night, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to Adam Dunn
and his crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the first people I ever saw use
rented buses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had tour buses for bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we parked them outside of the Fox or
the Oriental Theater one night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, you can't medicate in
here, but this is a VIP bus, wink,
[SPEAKER_02]: wink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to dab in there because
it's private property.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how that worked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was a cool event,
supporting a local glass artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people showed up, a lot of
friendly faces.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was super fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, I went to see some good
friends of mine downtown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went and ate some pizza, some mac and
cheese pizza from ... Fuck, I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: remember the name of this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, mac and cheese pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the white cheese sauce from the
mac and New York style bread on the ... It
[SPEAKER_03]: was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you do that at the start of the
show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I wonder how much pizza was sold on
420.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that so bad right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say a million dollars worth of
pizza, at least, easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much pizza is sold in
Denver on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually know a guy that works at a
pizza place who said that the owner of his
[SPEAKER_02]: pizza place almost had to close the
business because they weren't surviving
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cannabis was legalized and now
their business is thriving and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: opening more locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to cannabis and pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Pueblo for smoking more weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, more weed than ... So you've been
all over the place, Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have stuff to talk about on this
podcast, but we're going to get ADD today
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of good shit comes out in
these random conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, always.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you find smokes the most herb?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking Colorado only or are we
talking in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywhere you've been, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: California is interesting because I was in
the Bay and Northern Cali and it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis friendly up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the cities go, lifestyle culture
is very cannabis integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as of lately, Colorado, within the
last year, I feel has really stepped their
[SPEAKER_03]: shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many fucking people that blow
it down heavy down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between Denver and Pueblo, there's a lot
of heavy heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me reiterate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the mountains up North to Pueblo,
there's a lot of really heavy heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I still think that people in Colorado
really throw it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the city and our culture to
catch up with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently we smoke a lot of herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys do.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Miami to California to New York to
Oregon to Washington, all these places are
[SPEAKER_03]: different and stuff, but Colorado is still
the bedrock.
[SPEAKER_03]: People always look to us regardless of
whether we want to admit it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can accept that it's not about wearing
a badge or anything, but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Embrace it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so did you have a good 420,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was super nice minus the drive
from Pueblo to Denver to Pueblo on the
[SPEAKER_03]: same night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the same thing on 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a bad drive that night,
but there was a lot of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, which luckily I didn't hear
about any of our friends or anyone in
[SPEAKER_03]: close relation of our circles being fucked
with in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple of folks that got pulled
over, but they didn't get cited for
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least no one got fucked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was taking a hit off this blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks delicious and I'd love to hit it,
but not with the cold, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your favorite piece of glass you
saw at this glass showcase, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, calm at combo on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Calvin does the birds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of Weezy's favorite glass
artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's my favorite sculpture artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, his husband.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love his birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But him and Alex Tuba, who does those
Warlock pendies, they just went to Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fucking collabs that they did with
Team Japan, the Aquarius, the dudes that
[SPEAKER_03]: do all the dot work and all that,
just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one bird with a Mandela dot work
on the stomach and it was just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: the detail is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have gotten lost in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those pieces that I probably
wouldn't even use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would, but you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what the price tag was on that
piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: 15K on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you talk Team Japan and anything
calm, it's gonna be pricey, but holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful artwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of other great artists
there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Taylor made like this with,
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy's coming up quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he made the AK replica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's very adamant about gun stuff
and stuff, and you can see it in his glass
[SPEAKER_03]: work because the detail to the piece is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it with Pogo Glass, who he's a
great friend too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that guy kills it in his own regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lunchbox Mechanic, Matt Pinner,
he was there doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a lot of shit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got there pretty late and it was mostly
about just seeing people, because I hadn't
[SPEAKER_03]: gone into Denver almost two, three months
on any event like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was nice just catching up with all
friendly faces from up north that came
[SPEAKER_03]: into Denver from the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the fun part of these events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the art was just a bonus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird not having a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually the cup is where I see everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say as much shit as people talk
about the cup or whatever gripes they have
[SPEAKER_03]: against the competition side of it or
whatever it is, you can definitely feel
[SPEAKER_03]: the missed presence of that event.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: People had their opinions about it and
whatever you thought of it, it was just a
[SPEAKER_02]: great place to meet up with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would see everybody from Addison DeMora
to Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fox to just my random local friends there,
and we would all get along and hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would dab with Danny Danko, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd just hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be such a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nowhere else you can go and
see that many people.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at the same place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And though it's cool, because now I
unfortunately missed Secret Sessions this
[SPEAKER_03]: year, so I'm glad that I've been told that
they're going to be planning it for the
[SPEAKER_03]: next one because we'll be out there hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of events were planned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like of the fucking of the
seven, the five to seven events that I
[SPEAKER_03]: heard of, three to four of them,
all but two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the showcase got raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the cops did shut down almost all
consumption events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I was just laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not amused.
[SPEAKER_02]: My laughter was because I tried to pick up
a water bottle off of an oil slick pad,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was so much oil on the oil slick
pad that the water bottle just stuck to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty damn funny if you heard
my goofy laughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's what that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what that was all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were doing a magic trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I accidentally am a magician now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned Secret Sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's obviously where I was for 421.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm laughing at you guys complaining about
your driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in Colorado Springs for 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: I woke up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I woke up, got stoned as shit,
drove up to Colorado Springs to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The boss called me at two twenty or called
me at two o'clock and he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: be ready for two twenty dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pick you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to work for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My alarm went off and hits four o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and took another break,
celebrated four twenty, took about a half
[SPEAKER_02]: gram dab, went back to work, came home.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day I went to Secret Session.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went Pueblo Springs, Pueblo,
woke up, drove to Pueblo and drove to
[SPEAKER_02]: Springs on 421, handled the garden,
the stuff that needed to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drove to Secret Session, Denver,
raged Secret Session from about four in
[SPEAKER_02]: the afternoon until about one in the
morning, dabbing with all kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took 11 grams with me and I think I
smoked seven of them at the Secret
[SPEAKER_02]: Session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus whatever other people were dabbing me
out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you gave me a dab at Secret Session,
shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a huge good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a huge list of people I want to
give shout outs to from that, but I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about a couple of the things
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what I was saying,
but I drove back from the Secret Session
[SPEAKER_02]: to work to check on the plants again
because I didn't get everything done in
[SPEAKER_02]: the first half of the day and I knew the
plants weren't ready for more water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave them some time to chill and went
back and took care of them again later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I showed up to the garden at like three
in the morning, took care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shout out to you getting your shit
done, regardless of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: our holiday, which, you know, regardless
of, you know, it's great for the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're in the industry or you
have, you know, work to tend to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to balance the both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to extend that shout out
beyond myself to everybody, all the kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of soldiers that have a garden that when
you can see who it is, we'll be having a
[SPEAKER_02]: good ass time and six or eight people will
look at their watches and you see them go,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to go do something at the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all just take off, go to our separate
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That blunt is sticky, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of bras in inside too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the whole reason for the sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will, of course went to the Secret
Session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to everybody at the Secret
Session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a long list of people here that I
want to give shout outs to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I want to give a huge shout out
to my boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Hunt, the grimy motherfucking Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag I know Hunt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was trying to hit me up,
hit up Hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was hitting up Adam Mill,
trying to get into the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, there's one way to get into the
Secret Session.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go to the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to follow the rules and either
you get in or you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are very apparent about the
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, I can't help it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were quick to respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Adam Mill can't help you unless
you're already in our crew and on the list
[SPEAKER_02]: of promoters or vendors or sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to try to get in like
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: No fancy treatment here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't even there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Adam Mill, of course,
for hosting the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
What?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad that I missed him, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you're stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam McAdoshus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys follow Adam Blunt on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabber, Dabba Fishinato, Wook Chic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a huge shout out to my buddy DJ
Juggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Juggie is the DJ that's on some of Task
Rock's material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've met Juggie one other
time, but it was more crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was actually was blessed enough to
be hanging out in the green room.

people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if I didn't give you a shout out
because like I said, we, we got dad the
fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to run to the green room and get
snacks one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I am so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go to the green room and get
snacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I abused the shit out of that green room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever, you're, you have a booth and
stuff at the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever get to where you just need a
fucking break?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I love everybody and this is
fun, but I just want to go not talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: people and just not, not be here for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get that on a year that you want
a cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the green room was an amazing place to
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like snacks and a chill place.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but you're totally, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couches and shit in a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to sit down for like 20 minutes and
not like do anything while I take tabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had my girlfriend at the time
helping and a friend from Miami and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so tired after day three.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cannabis cup was the first time you
and I ever shook hands and met face to
[SPEAKER_02]: face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you gave me one of those banana bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I ended up getting some arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some arise seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the black cherry cams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what you asked for specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yes, your black cherry cam was
the whole reason I've been following you
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to mention this while we're on this
topic, you guys, I love the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the cravings for my seeds,
but I cannot ship you seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you guys are emailing me,
they're hitting me up through the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to get you some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the way that you might be able to get
seeds is to go to the dank team.com and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may have, I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I can recommend to you mile high La
Plata since city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can highly recommend rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Cali connection has a lot of cool
shit, but I can, I cannot send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's just how it is in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ditto.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come here and I can give you some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I sent out a bunch of free CBD
seeds, but you know, um, they're all like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was all pretty much verified hemp and I
did it for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a very short amount of time where I
was like, yeah, I'm sending out 32 to
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then I had to do it again
for that same reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need CBD seeds, come to Colorado
and Fox and I will hook you up with
[SPEAKER_02]: handfuls of free CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, but there's, you know,

[SPEAKER_02]: labs, um, mile high, can of venture,
sour seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Nice, Mr. Nice from old school back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm actually grabbing a big chunk of,
uh, mango hay seeds because I just came
[SPEAKER_03]: known to me that that was the strain that
I grew up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a similar friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was just trying to give me mango
hay seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to be public.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to get my hands on these and
you know, get back to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find that what I grew up on, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about the events that we did
attend and then you kind of hinted at
[SPEAKER_02]: events getting busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, quite a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colorado cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Steve DeFino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into that too, cause he's a good
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should get him on here to talk about
this, but the Colorado cup was rated and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually got a copy of the search
warrant on my phone if we wanted to read
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we should delve into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that might be interesting actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they claim to have found some drugs
actually in the DJ booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim there was some drugs in the DJ
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also the DJ booth was the only room
without a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard to, it's hard to say
what happened there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so there was an event at a place
called Riggs R us and it was the Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: cup and it was an event similar to a
cannabis cup where people enter their
[SPEAKER_02]: strains of cannabis extracts, edibles and
cannabis wares and whatnots and people
[SPEAKER_02]: judge them and they decided to winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, on 4 20 at 3 PM, the Denver city
police came in with bandanas on their
[SPEAKER_02]: faces and the shotguns in their hands
kicked in the front doors and started
[SPEAKER_02]: yelling, get out, get out, get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of the people that were in there
thought the place was getting robbed
[SPEAKER_02]: because they did not announce that they
were police until everybody left and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody was on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a uniformed officer walked in and
delivered a search warrant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: After everything was all, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody thought the place was getting
fucking robbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend who was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sent me a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sent me a video from the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the cops that first went in just
looked like thugs in Dickies and combat
[SPEAKER_02]: boots and bandanas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were followed by armed cops who
were then followed by like riot cops,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, just to come shut down any illegal
smoke, a bunch of peaceful fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They needed riot gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of our tax money was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually sounds like 60 grand from
what you just said, there were several Mac
[SPEAKER_02]: books being used for data entry for the
cup that was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these cops poured bottled water all
over the Mac books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you fucking serious?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottles of water over the Mac books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For no reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly I was not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you know, serious claims,
you know, shout out to my source on the
[SPEAKER_02]: street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, the Denver PD, it doesn't have
the cleanest record for how they deal
[SPEAKER_03]: with, um, public affairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to read any of the,
I could read you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was 38 charges filed against these
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go find the message.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while you find the message,
I'll delve into AJ Hashman a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up AJ?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the thing with AJ and I'm not
one to talk shit or say anything of
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone, but I'll tell you my first
experience with him back last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember the gypsy Jane fest?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, but I remember seeing the posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a huge joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they got stooped to come in to do
whatever he did for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half the artists didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the company running it lied about
ticket sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of vendors got fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people bought $40,000 booths and
recoup nothing on top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was like a three day event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the second day, a lot of these
people's stuff got broken into and the
[SPEAKER_03]: guys that came in to promote the event and
help build it, it all left and left
[SPEAKER_03]: everything high and dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so AJ's role in this was they,
they had seeked him out to do the,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, judging portion of the edible
competition and concentrate competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what ended up happening was he took
like 17 grams or 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was over half an ounce of concentrate
from us and told us that no dispensaries
[SPEAKER_03]: would be entering and that it would just
be an independent thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we made the time, got some flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the case was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it was okay, but,
uh, fuck, I can't remember the name of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the clinic or someone who had just
gone wreck came in and bought fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: ounces of this shit and turned in a
category, uh, entry for every category and
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of voided everything he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, on top of that, we found out that
my entry was never judged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a year ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's flash forward to Colorado cup,
Steve Dufino and his flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our entry, he had two entries,
his cheesequake, which I can personally
[SPEAKER_03]: say as an extractor, as a girl,
as a breeder, you know, he does great
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to extract it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to squish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super terpy material.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he also entered your heart of gold,
heart of gold, which is a golden goat
[SPEAKER_03]: cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very sativa dominant cross you would
say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the whole scheme of things,
you know, what, like you just said,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got rated, um, Steve almost lost his,
you know, possessions or whatever the case
[SPEAKER_03]: was because of that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He ended up getting it and they're giving
him shit or whatever the case was,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he didn't find out till a few days
later after they announced the,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the winnings that his entries weren't
even judged, which, you know, is typical
[SPEAKER_03]: of something that AJ would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's rewind a little bit again.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would do these things and promote these
events called canter raves and whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: the case was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't really around for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just only heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same similar thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't get permits for anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops would constantly come to the
events.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vendors would get fucked because he
would collect money.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was charging more money for what he was
like, Oh, um, if you want your entry
[SPEAKER_03]: tested $40, uh, what that actually costs
is 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was actually skimming off the top of
every entry that, you know, that was made
[SPEAKER_03]: on top of what he was getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like, you know,
I can understand why someone would be
[SPEAKER_03]: upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve, our good friend, Steve was not too
happy when he heard that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was verified.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just feel like one people with that
kind of track record, you should just not
[SPEAKER_03]: do events.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have nothing ill to say about AJ,
dude, fucking I'll smoke with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, but I can't say the same for
Steve or some of the other competitors as
[SPEAKER_03]: you kind of fucked over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that being said, um, me and Steve have
been talking about authenticity and
[SPEAKER_03]: competition and trying to do something
more towards that, but that was a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: bust on their part of the competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, um, yeah, I wish it hadn't
gone that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people told me about the Colorado
cup, I asked who was throwing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I heard who it was, I kind of had
to pull from it, knowing that one,
[SPEAKER_03]: the cops are either going to get involved
or two, my entry is going to be taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it could just go to
patients if that's the case, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like why bother?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that reminds me that I did not do a
shout out to the venue where we held the
[SPEAKER_03]: secret session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I want to say the name
of the venue because we're going to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: again and it's a secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to the venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place is rad, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Word on the street is we're doing secret
session again in May and there is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: chance that Rasta Jeff will be the co-host
because in June and July I will be the
[SPEAKER_02]: host of the secret session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things go our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might not be supposed to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only listeners can know that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anybody you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all a secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam and I are going to get together and
talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably be hosting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get ridiculous up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found a list of, this is the
inventory that was confiscated by the
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'm, there are 20 articles,
20 items listed on the front page and it
[SPEAKER_02]: says number one marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the basement storage area.

reclaiming.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like we're gonna Charge them for
this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh suspected ecstasy in the dj room

[SPEAKER_02]: session here That was good i'm gonna
fucking use that as a hashtag bashman
[SPEAKER_02]: bashman, um Let's actually we're 30
minutes into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some cbd stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, i've got a thing on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me find I just took a Screenshot of a
message somebody sent me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everything is in our damn phones
these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know it's Crazy stupid how much
these things are like lifelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy says um, i'm gonna summarize a
little bit He says his mother-in-law has
[SPEAKER_02]: parkinson's and is really against
pharmaceuticals Is to the point where
[SPEAKER_02]: she's really getting bad after listening
to countless hours of my show This
[SPEAKER_02]: listener figured that I may have an idea
as far as strains and whatnot Uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: she is onto the idea of medical marijuana
But has it in her mind that the cbd
[SPEAKER_02]: Available in texas will not help and this
person is sure that they won't If we could
[SPEAKER_02]: please lay some knowledge on this listener
about this, uh, there's a whole family
[SPEAKER_02]: that would appreciate it Uh, first of all,
i'm gonna be a grammar nazi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's let's correct the world here
with cbd's Uh, let's just start saying cbd
[SPEAKER_03]: cbd's is not pluralized the same way that
we don't pluralize thc's Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's just we don't do it and we
or water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah water is Yeah, you don't say I want
to get some waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get all the waters out of this
glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah, it's cbd There's and yeah,
that's this is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and also since i'm on this it's not
strands It is strains strands or hair
[SPEAKER_02]: strains or cannabis if you want to get
specific you could say cultivar or
[SPEAKER_02]: varietal But let's just not say fucking
strands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard the strands in a while
Yeah, I heard it the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it the other day It made it made
the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like you're so pretty and you just
said strands i'm leaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, so this guy and also since we
are we're making jokes about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh, I i'm sorry your mother in law has
parkinson's that is terrible to hear about
[SPEAKER_02]: And fox is the guy here that is great at
helping with this type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So First he wants to know if we can
recommend a strain that would help with
[SPEAKER_02]: parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there's a few options.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um If she's okay with the cannabis and
there's a few one-to-one options that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can go with that would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um You know torah borah being one of them
um torah sue Harlequin which I think comes
[SPEAKER_03]: in at a three to one or two to one and
certain certain cases seven to one another
[SPEAKER_03]: great strain um If she's coming around or
slowly coming around to the idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis Um, I would say start her
off with the higher cbd strains to you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, higher ratio of a cbd to thc auto
from centennial seeds Oh that that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: great example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously the you're in texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your options Are very limited and
unless you can get a specific cut of this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know of what i'm talking about On the
acdc side at least you're gonna have to go
[SPEAKER_03]: with something like the auto but from what
I understand it's like 120 to one So and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's you know, when he keeps saying i'm
gonna interrupt you i'm sorry He keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: saying 120 to one or two to one we're
talking about thc to cbd ratios And we're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to find the higher cbd ratio for
you is what we need Yes, so that she's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get the killer headbush.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not going to be high and giggly
She's actually going to get the medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits from the cannabis because it's
higher in cbd than thc I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: clear that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep I don't know how many people
understand the ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, absolutely No, thank you for for for I
try not to go past people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're fine That's great because I
forget to elaborate on that sometimes i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not the best at that So, um, yeah that
being said and like you said centennial
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds auto would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think uh cbd crew is another uh,
you know seed company that would be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to help um booms farm also has some
strains that are you know, like I said you
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can tell them what your
situation is where you are and they'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to Help you with their strain list
and give you something that you know Will
[SPEAKER_03]: keep you you know in the legal boundaries
of what you need But to just let's say
[SPEAKER_03]: with the auto the autos are great to start
off with and let's just say why So cbd is
[SPEAKER_03]: a neuroprotractant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's been a few cases done on the
effects of cbd on parkinsons and It
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely helps with the confusion It
helps with the tremors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps with a lot of The symptoms that
you see Usually with that disease or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything, you know and related to that
condition So yes, obviously it's a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: help uh tinctures, you know, uh sublingual
dosing depending on what The case is is
[SPEAKER_03]: usually you know, would be the quickest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um There are cbd ready products that can
also you know that you can get um I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry that the company's eluding me at
this point, you know, because I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just can't think of it to mind But
there are those products available if you
[SPEAKER_03]: you know If you need something quicker
than just growing what will help her part
[SPEAKER_02]: of his question was that he does not
believe that the cbd products available in
[SPEAKER_02]: texas will be Of much use and I asked him
more questions about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little short conversation On
messenger on the instagram messenger here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I asked him he said he doesn't feel
like the cbd available there in texas will
[SPEAKER_02]: help Um, and he's sure that they won't and
then he asked me how I felt about that And
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked why he doesn't feel like the cbd
there will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the same question He said that uh,
he doesn't believe it's going to be cbd
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, which we've seen a lot People sell
cbd oil and it ends up just being a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred percent cod oil and they're just
Okay, so so then i'm gonna be more
[SPEAKER_03]: specific than um I'll start off by giving
out my email, you know, and this can go
[SPEAKER_03]: out and I don't mind uh foxtrack cbd at
gmail.com um, even if it's not directly
[SPEAKER_03]: through me, I will happily direct you
through a verified hemp oil sale,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know growers farmers extractors I
also know a few slew of companies that
[SPEAKER_03]: already make 50 state-ready cbd products
that are legitimate They're backed up by
[SPEAKER_03]: testing they you know will have testing
From everything from potency Pesticides to
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew and have heavy metals and you know
an infused product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um Yeah, uh shit i'm so sorry that
it's living on on the products But you can
[SPEAKER_03]: always get at me and I will happily you
know, i've got them all on my phone Which
[SPEAKER_03]: is right next to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go ahead and take a look in your
phone Yeah, let me see i'll do my best to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the links also i'll get fox's email
address again So that you guys don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to rewind the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put all this stuff in the show notes
Uh so that you guys can easily go and find
[SPEAKER_02]: that i'll leave some links there in the
show notes for you Uh, that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the most helpful thing that I can
do is this cbd legal in texas the cbd
[SPEAKER_02]: product you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, absolutely Okay, um,
you know, I was working with uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: halo labs for a while which and they were
doing an isolate that was we were getting
[SPEAKER_03]: back out at 99.5 or five seven percent and
uh, I infused a lot of uh 50 state legal
[SPEAKER_03]: products with a lot of those hard candies
and lollipops that I made were 50 state
[SPEAKER_03]: legal and you know, I I sent those out for
free to a lot of people because they were
[SPEAKER_03]: skeptical about that and You know just to
get an idea some people obviously we
[SPEAKER_03]: support whole plant cannabis I mean,
you know both is best the whole plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: best but if you're in a situation or have
a condition where it's more neurologically
[SPEAKER_03]: tied then higher concentrations of cbd is
where you want to be and so, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything has its place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't knock one thing or another when it
comes to you know anything cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: related so There is a company called cbd
underscore pure meds lab and They are some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the biggest wholesalers out here and
that's that's on instagram and i'll repeat
[SPEAKER_03]: that at cbd underscore Pure meds lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it wrong the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did it right because I wrote
it down properly Okay, cool pure med slab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna be pure meds lab whichever
either way I interpreted slabs,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, hey slabs either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, they have everything They're
coming out with uh, you know everything
[SPEAKER_03]: from cbd coffee to thousand milligram
tinctures So, you know, you can get a wide
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of what you might need and you
know, like I said, dude I'm not in it to
[SPEAKER_03]: just sit there and tell you that my
product's gonna be the best or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't Actively put out products like
that, but I can tell you There are slew of
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that are legitimate,
you know that that do cbd international is
[SPEAKER_03]: another one I personally do not you know I
have nothing against them or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just you know, uh, I know they're
legitimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're out of california as well
Cannabinoids heal is their instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: handle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um cbd health solutions is another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are a wholesaler which also deal in
uh can of drop tinctures and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot and Yeah, like we can go on and on
I shop at a health food store in colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: springs and in their window They have a
sign that they sell cbd drops,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course from the stanley brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Is that product worth a shit in your
opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um You know actually i'll tell you what
i'm gonna go and pick some up and then i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna have it tested through my friend
nate And then we should do another
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about that If you want me to help
you, uh pay for the cost of that bottle to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah for sure the cost of the Testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure nate would you know love to do it
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll definitely give him a shout out on
the show Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but yeah, um, I I think that they're
the biggest charlatans of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you definitely have to be careful
Just you know a little bit of research
[SPEAKER_03]: goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can also look into halo labs,
um out of arizona They are big wholesalers
[SPEAKER_03]: as well and they you know work with other
companies To completely reband products
[SPEAKER_03]: under what they do at their lab in
arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um So yeah, and like I said, uh,
i'm completely an open source,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, jeff can you know provide all
that information for this show and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll put all this stuff will be in the
show links show notes so that you guys can
[SPEAKER_02]: have links to it on the instagram Um,
so first oh go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but and it's good for you to be
cautious, you know And i'm sorry that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to feel that way, but I promise you
there are companies out there that are you
[SPEAKER_03]: know legitimately, you know Pursuing the
hemp products for what they truly are and
[SPEAKER_03]: not just trying to make a quick buck on
you know, um You know the unfortunate
[SPEAKER_02]: situation of our loved ones also check out
king cola on instagram and sansal cbd in
[SPEAKER_02]: pueblo colorado Yes, uh, I definitely
support their cbd project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they may be able to give you
information You may be able to acquire a
[SPEAKER_02]: product from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you what they can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just recommending them I know they're
very knowledgeable good-hearted folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely great folks Um something I
should mention if you're going to consume
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for your parkinsons, uh,
don't only focus on the cbd for the
[SPEAKER_02]: healing I would recommend something a
light sativa like a jelly bean or a tangy
[SPEAKER_02]: because you need I think uh, the sativa
the thc and the sativa is good to help
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment But at the same time that's
going to put you the patient in a better
[SPEAKER_02]: mood It's going to uplift uplift your
spirits a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make you a little more
social It's going to put a smile on your
[SPEAKER_02]: face And that's a huge part of healing
people is keeping them happy and keeping a
[SPEAKER_03]: smile on their face Absolutely,
your mood is everything especially in
[SPEAKER_03]: recovery or in healing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um So strains that have uh, you know known
properties of uplifting, you know mood and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, um anti-anxiety, uh Jelly bean
jelly base queen for me dairy queen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, a lot of the queens kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't I don't find them as racy I
find them smooth creamy relaxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right to vortex on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a yeah vortex used to fuck
Yeah, yeah, that's like, uh same breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all tga subculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely and they have a wide
variety Of uh things in that line of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's awesome that things like
that are available when you're right You
[SPEAKER_03]: know not to just focus on the cbd only
side of things flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colorado flow is a very uplifting
smile morning bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, dj shorts blueberry, you know,
it's not the most uh knock you down
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, but the smoke is incredibly
enjoyable Very medicinal as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have it could have good cbd and a
very good head aroma or a head high to and
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice blueberry aroma Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah shot at the dj short.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been breeding for longer Than most of
us have even been thinking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes or had any inclination of wanting to
work with it true breeder true true
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a second ago you mentioned tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um We were talking about tincture
and dosage on another episode What do you
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: for dosage on a tincture say somebody has
cancer or Maybe I don't even want to
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnose anybody with another condition,
but a sick person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just go with cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds Decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's go with cancer because uh,
it would be different You know if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: more focused on the neurological condition
and it's a higher dose of cbd And if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: thc only or whether they're getting delta
9 or all factors in how it's going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: But so cancer we're going to go the other
way around um obviously Treatment,
[SPEAKER_03]: um that we've guidelines that we followed
is through, you know rick simpson though I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't use his extraction methods of you
know, um gram a day for 90 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: um Uh and and doing that, you know when I
say that thc high oil and when I say um a
[SPEAKER_03]: gram a day, it's really more like a
thousand milligrams a day and Obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know a gram Isn't a thousand
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that we you know,
uh, not enough gets focused on So in the
[SPEAKER_03]: short of it, let's not say a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say a thousand milligrams a day for
90 days Um, that's gonna make people feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like shit also Yeah, um, there's you know,
um They usually you know the way you would
[SPEAKER_03]: start, you know Because people have been
consuming this oil raw for so long They
[SPEAKER_03]: would start with like little p-sized bits
and that would fuck them up and they'd
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of work their way up um You know
trying to work with uh different
[SPEAKER_03]: Extraction methods and non-solvent
techniques and trying to you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: gain the same uptake, you know in the
amount but not feeling So sluggish or more
[SPEAKER_03]: importantly some of uh, some of our bodies
can't process That oil the way that we
[SPEAKER_03]: should fortunately and it's better left as
a topical for a melanoma or so at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point If our bodies can't process it or if
you know if we have compromised digestive
[SPEAKER_03]: problems, you know Whether it be Crohn's
colitis, whatever the case is throw that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit out the door You need something that
isn't going to harm your gut, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: because because of how um Uh the
extraction method leaves it a little it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a little harsh, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a little sludgy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's sludgy There's a little burn
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, regardless of how clean it is a lot of
people aren't using Grape ethanol most
[SPEAKER_03]: people are using everclear because that's
what's available to them So there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of those things that come into account,
you know, so we try not to deal with that
[SPEAKER_03]: at all um, you know, you've seen me i'm
focusing more on the non-solvent part of
[SPEAKER_03]: that and trying to Focus and you know
de-winterize Rosin and start doing things
[SPEAKER_03]: of that sort and seeing what we can do
Without having to use alcohol or butane or
[SPEAKER_03]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and keep it organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a friend of ours is uh starting a
Vineyard, you know with uh some grapes and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to be doing a little uh,
you know, a little project We'll be making
[SPEAKER_03]: our own uh grape ethanol Yeah,
so, you know, we're trying to make this
[SPEAKER_03]: all in, you know pablo nonetheless,
so it's all Colorado organic at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the people that talk crap about pablo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing some things here you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah Killing it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah i'm super happy to come down and
be part of you know There's already a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of great people good caregivers,
uh good breeders doing their things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so yeah, definitely pablo is killing
it So for cancer you'd basically recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: 1000 milligrams of thc per day to try to
fight the cancer and you do that for at
[SPEAKER_03]: least 90 days Yeah, I mean, you know,
I know that sounds Intense and so i'll say
[SPEAKER_03]: this um You know if it's for our loved
ones or whatever the case is taking it via
[SPEAKER_03]: suppository will Bypass that feeling of
you eating, you know a gram plus a day Our
[SPEAKER_03]: bodies will still take it and absorb it
and we'll get all the cancer killing
[SPEAKER_03]: qualities of the thc Without that effect
of it going through our digestive system
[SPEAKER_03]: and then into our bloodstream,
you know You'll probably get more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you To get it absorbed quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty amazing how that works,
you know And we're not talking about just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting some hash or buds in your butt you
guys know It's got to be activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably some hash oil with some
coconut oil inside of a pill Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: special pill and then you have to
obviously know where you're placing it so
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes Into your tract and so on and so
forth and I don't get too specific But you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, um, if you guys are curious about
that again, you know, uh ask me i'm more
[SPEAKER_03]: than happy to go into that if You want to
do an episode on gastrointestinal,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know side effects and things with cbd
we can totally do that, but Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy lives like 15 minutes away from
me now you guys so who will be on the show
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot Send me all of your cbd questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely i'm more than happy to
you know Help in any way I can um,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah at least a thousand milligrams a
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um Obviously a lot of people don't have
that advantage of knowing someone who can
[SPEAKER_03]: make the suppositories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um Maybe that's something I can work with
In the future and try to just you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh create, you know put something out
there as a little you know formula for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to follow but in the meanwhile,
um If you can find on the same level there
[SPEAKER_03]: are people who make 10 000 milligram
tinctures where every dropper is like 400
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams, you know If you happen to be
in colorado or medical state, it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be much easier to find these if not,
um Again, you know trying to find the
[SPEAKER_03]: material and it creates that you know that
medicine is essential, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna have to basically Get your
math right and it's just so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breaks my heart speaking You know about
that to other people knowing that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: in states where they can't get their oil
tested So they can't get the math right on
[SPEAKER_03]: what the milk the the dosage really is
exactly and so there's a guessing game of
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're lucky enough to have the
material to make the oil the way that they
[SPEAKER_03]: need to how the fuck are they going to
dose it or how the fuck is they going to
[SPEAKER_03]: accurately like It just upsets me,
you know for them as patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, but Nevertheless, uh, you know where
there's the will there's a way,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and lives are more important than
laws in my opinion, uh Hashtag lives over
[SPEAKER_03]: laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep So people, you know, uh people
listening that are, you know curious about
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, I don't support anything
that would ever jeopardize your freedom,
[SPEAKER_03]: but If you're trying to help someone you
love then I will happily share whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: information I can you know Fox is here to
teach you will sit down with each and
[SPEAKER_02]: every one of you and teach you What he
knows if that's what's needed pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So We talked about somebody with cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about if you've just got like I've
got some knee inflammation I work hard my
[SPEAKER_03]: body, you know, I'm I'm a puss I got you
kind of a tall dude, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you put it on your joints I get the lower
back pain and the knee pain going on at
[SPEAKER_02]: this age.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend tincture wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: for a guy in my condition, um Honestly,
like one-to-ones are the way to get like
[SPEAKER_03]: one-to-ones for when you get off of work
and some High CBD low THC, you know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: need to take it throughout the day,
you know, it'll It'll prevent any
[SPEAKER_03]: inflammation if it's towards the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help bring any down that you have
It'll help Relax your muscles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're stiff, you know, you you
know, you won't have that stiffness I
[SPEAKER_03]: think CBD is a great way to start in the
morning, especially Do you juice or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, are you like crap lately?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honest truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a vegetarian that eats like crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why you're my favorite vegetarian I'm
not sure what that means, but okay I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: the vegan guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Shoot a toy for the sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right I can reroute us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you recommend utilizing reclaim in
tincture or edible form?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so yeah, let's be honest,
you know if you I would suggest if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm medicating or whatever you
drop-downs are essential for collecting
[SPEAKER_03]: reclaim because you don't want to Collect
some reclaim that's had water through it
[SPEAKER_03]: and have to it's just a whole process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want that humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, yes It's been proven that you
know, I've seen reclaimed tests high as
[SPEAKER_03]: 63% You know THC So and that's activated
oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, it's not fully activated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at that point it pretty you know
Recollecting it and putting into a
[SPEAKER_03]: container and then you know Activating it
for a bit longer will really I mean it
[SPEAKER_03]: creates great food grade, you know Clean
it up properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure all the moisture is out of it,
you know add your oil carrier,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know your fat carrier whatever you
want to call it and You're good to go on
[SPEAKER_03]: your edibles, you know or your capsules
for that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep talking about Activating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you teach us about decarboxylation and
activation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so decarboxylation decarbing your
oil So depending on what you're doing for
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD damn man is gonna be pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose that's kind of with her like a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right So when you're decarbing for
Certain oils you can decarb for a more
[SPEAKER_03]: sedative oil, you know, like you can
convert CBD or THC oil into CBN and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just like It's beyond sedative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's beyond indica plus,
you know, so it's like sleepy time for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure Okay, like sleepy time t times two,
you know Which is great or you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can do shorter decarb times at
different temperatures to stay within that
[SPEAKER_03]: Not break that acid barrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you decarboxylate something
there's an oil decarboxylic acid which
[SPEAKER_03]: accounts for a certain percentage so when
you Do that, you're gonna obtain a loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like minuscule.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not gonna notice it But you need to
know like, you know when you see the
[SPEAKER_03]: bubbles coming up out of your oil and
stuff That's decarboxylic acid,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know coming up and you know Leaving,
you know the the oil so that you you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people assume that that it's
Solvent or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, but if you're started with clean
oil, that's not the case if you've already
[SPEAKER_03]: dabbed it There's no solvent left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly or you know if you know
Depending on the situation and then I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: actually gonna start decarboxylating of
all the solventless stuff So I've never
[SPEAKER_03]: really done a lot of that because I've you
know focused on Butane extractions mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: or isolate concentrates So it'll be
interesting to see I don't think it should
[SPEAKER_03]: be too different with the rosin but Yeah,
so wouldn't you think the rosin is kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: already activated a little since it's been
through so much heat See, that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking You know half grams from all
these different presses and I want to get
[SPEAKER_03]: them Tested for that reason, but from what
I've seen even from like soil grown stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: and other people I haven't seen It's not
fully activated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, even the chips come in at like fit
like that raw the reclaim the rosin chips
[SPEAKER_03]: are coming in at like 30 to 50% You know,
you can do an ISO soak or even better What
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do personally if you guys do the
rosin you guys are big collectors is do
[SPEAKER_03]: can of butter with your rosin chips Wow,
you know because that's you're gonna you
[SPEAKER_03]: can break it all down almost like a mulch
and just you know double up on your
[SPEAKER_03]: cheesecloth when you're filtering,
you know, if you're OCD like me and It'll
[SPEAKER_03]: make some great butter for edibles like
hands down, you know, so nice real good
[SPEAKER_03]: body high use it all no, absolutely I'm a
total fan of an Advocate of using the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're actually growing some of
them with just water straight water no
[SPEAKER_03]: needs so that we can juice those those
couple of Weeks, you know, we can say like
[SPEAKER_03]: no animal byproduct nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't spray them with any nothing
just straight our over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so We're excited about that I'm
going to pull something up so that We can
[SPEAKER_03]: get a little specific with the
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it We're gonna learn a whole bunch
of stuff here guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be patient while he searches He's got a
little bit of information to pull up for
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys can use your reclaim and he
mentioned using a drop-down We often
[SPEAKER_02]: forget that some of our friends are not
dabbers And they don't dab daily and they
[SPEAKER_02]: might be in other states where the toilets
flush the wrong way and the weed grows
[SPEAKER_02]: upside down Yeah, our Australian friends I
might have said states too and he's in
[SPEAKER_02]: another country.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a state I found out Australia
had states like I stupidly thought it was
[SPEAKER_03]: just Australia and all of Australia and
there's like no parts of he didn't find
[SPEAKER_03]: out Sydney Yeah, that's just the dumb of
other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so a drop-down you guys a drop-down
will go on your normally where the nail
[SPEAKER_02]: would go You put a drop-down in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a piece of glass that Comes out where
the nail would go and it angles down and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it angles back up to where your nail
or your email could go on it and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: puts the nail a couple of inches away from
your face and It also makes a nice place
[SPEAKER_02]: to catch the reclaim oil so that it
doesn't end up in your rig water So that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what a drop-down is when he was talking
about a drop-down earlier Shout out to my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend Rasta said in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good seeing you on Facebook live
Fox is diligently searching for this
[SPEAKER_02]: information here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so We're gonna talk THC first so
boiling point for THC would be 315 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: Fahrenheit and that's what that that would
start to boil off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so and that's when it starts to
convert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and that will convert it to If
there's any CBD to convert to that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: it would convert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to the THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would want to be between 290 and
310 degrees Fahrenheit 290 and 310.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because that's between the CBCA and
THC barrier CBCA is another Compound we
[SPEAKER_03]: can that's it's a whole nother three-hour
conversation, but we can get into that so
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll have that one Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's just dark talk for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways getting back to that so that
will activate your Delta 9 which is
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously your It's also an
anti-inflammatory appetite stimulant
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-emetic anti-profolific and
antioxidant on top of you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the wonderful things that it does with
cancer That being said Depending on how
[SPEAKER_03]: long you go on the decarb you can over you
know, you can burn your oil So you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: be careful of that you know going for the
longer decarbs, but I've decarbed oil for
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, three hours six hours eight
hours just to see just to get to see where
[SPEAKER_03]: the set of effect comes out where the
burnout, you know, we're my burning things
[SPEAKER_03]: out, you know and I you know, you can
decarb the oil for let's say 90 minutes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and but honestly, I would say
180 minutes is you know a good starting
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like to look at it every every
Shit every 45 to 60 minutes to see how
[SPEAKER_03]: it's doing, you know, cuz every oil that
you start with is different It's not gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be my all you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna be using your oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll tell you these, you know times and
mindsets but just keep in mind and keep an
[SPEAKER_03]: eye on everything and Once all the
decarboxic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I'm saying that right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry from that little medicated You know
comes out of the oil and what you're left
[SPEAKER_03]: with is, you know this decarbed Goodness
that is fully activated, you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on what temperature points that
you're hitting you're either activating
[SPEAKER_03]: for CBD You're activating for terpene rich
activated oil It all depends, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like you can just play around your
temperatures and have a completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different product depending on what you do
How is what so if I had some reclaim if I
[SPEAKER_02]: had my drop-down I had some reclaim and I
collected a substantial amount now I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to activate it To decarb it and I want to
get it to this temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I just put it in a Pyrex dish and maybe
throw it in the oven?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a tech to this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you want to share?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay to make it really easy and just like
you can call it low tech or whatever so
[SPEAKER_03]: get yourself to Target or Walmart or
whatever your You know, I don't care who
[SPEAKER_03]: you go to but any place that sells Pyrex
and try to find a small like Shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what kind of little
bullet is like a little home Pyrex Like a
[SPEAKER_03]: little salsa bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like like like a little pampered
chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah exactly, you know, they'll sell them
in a few different sizes try to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: small one if you can because you know,
it's just make it easier and then You can
[SPEAKER_03]: take your drop-down when it's full or
gunked up and take a torch to it and when
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that Very, you know gently just
torch it a little bit until you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: the oil moving Excuse me, and then you you
can pour all the oil into Little ramekin
[SPEAKER_03]: cup or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the rent the Pyrex ramekin and Yeah,
after that, you know after you've got that
[SPEAKER_03]: all poured in, you know Be very careful
not to you know, crack your drop-down,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know There's easier ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put the drop-down in the oven and
Let it get you know warm and pour it out
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever but kids don't try This at
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah this way just kind of works a little
bit easier You know just taking a light
[SPEAKER_03]: little flame to it watching the oil move.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll all Dump out and then you can start
getting to work on that Yeah, after you
[SPEAKER_03]: de-carb it you can you know add your
carrot oil I always like to so once we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got it into the Petri or the the ramekin
Yeah, now what do we do with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay now you've got it in there you
Set your temperature depending on what you
[SPEAKER_03]: need you can actually if you guys want to
learn something you can google cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: activation chart and You'll see a bunch of
different pictures and graphs and it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of give you an idea of You know where
you want to go most people like I said are
[SPEAKER_03]: just activating, you know for the THC and
that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So You know, like I said, so let's say an
even 300 180 minutes, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just pop it in the oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah pop it in the oven Let's do its thing
Some people like to add the carrot oil
[SPEAKER_03]: before they decarb it I Like to decarb the
oil completely and then add my carrier oil
[SPEAKER_03]: to it, you know, whether it's gonna be
avocado coconut grapeseed Lynch,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whatever Grape seed oil Sun
sunflower seed oil, whatever There's a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch like each depending on the patient
whatever the hell they're allergic to you
[SPEAKER_03]: like alright, there's there's something
thankfully Guaranteed a fat that your body
[SPEAKER_03]: can take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Needless to say, you know,
there's ways around whatever but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you put it in the oven, you know,
you set your time you check on it once
[SPEAKER_03]: it's ready, you know you Add oh and let's
back up a little bit before you put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the oven weigh it out Know how much that
you're working with that makes it super
[SPEAKER_03]: easy So you're working with seven grams or
three grams or whatever You know how much
[SPEAKER_03]: coconut oil you're gonna put in you want
to weigh that out to that will make it a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a weight-specific ratio that you can
work with Sometimes I go really low,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like one gram to seven grams,
you know and or less You know just to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of get it to this Wonderful, you know all
for consistency depending on what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, you know That being said Once
that's added once once you have your
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers and everything's weighed do
everything we talked about said it said in
[SPEAKER_03]: the your petri dish or your Makin cup put
it in the oven do you carve it for X
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time add your oil?
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you know, it's it's bonded
that the side separated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put it back in the oven for just a
little while And then you know follow the
[SPEAKER_03]: recipe of what to whatever you're trying
to do capsules If you're trying to you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, keep the oil you can pull it a
syringe, you know and keep it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Keep it ready for until you need
it or you know, whatever you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: do Nice Those syringes are sketchy
looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not Yeah, but sometimes that's
the best way that you can apply it to
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you're doing Yeah, or so,
you know the best way to collect it in
[SPEAKER_03]: excuse me in large amounts You are a
wealth of CBD knowledge my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah people don't yeah, I guess I Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that somebody I'm a weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love knowing about breeding and strains
and strain selection I love that stuff I
[SPEAKER_02]: love that somebody is focused in on the
cannabinoids in the making specific
[SPEAKER_02]: Products for people that's really rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that That's a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of jealous right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been going for just about an hour
I'm gonna ask you one more question and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we're gonna have to wrap up this show
for the night It's almost midnight here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt Fox will be back you guys he
lives close like I said and we get along
[SPEAKER_02]: real well and he shows up with Terps So
he'll be back and he brings this really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool rig So somebody sent me an email they
they're pregnant They're gonna have a baby
[SPEAKER_02]: and they wanted to know how I feel and
what information I had on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: pregnancy and honestly as a Stoner dude,
I really haven't thought too much about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel that that's a lot of my
business I shouldn't be preaching anything
[SPEAKER_02]: about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you have an opinion on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do and First of all, let me start
by saying, you know, a woman's body is her
[SPEAKER_03]: own fucking business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely I'm not one to say shit But
I'll tell you my experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my ex-wife the mother my child Had a
horrible morning sickness like holy shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, just as she wasn't able to work She
wasn't able to work at her job,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, she was a banker at the time It
was it was really affecting her what
[SPEAKER_03]: helped, you know was some cannabis in the
morning You know, this is we weren't this
[SPEAKER_03]: is this is back way back Eight nine years
ago, you know almost ten years ago So it
[SPEAKER_03]: people weren't up on the clean oil game
the way that we are for the most part,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Miami whatever the case is so
You're lucky to get good flour whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: the case is and that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at first it kind of made me Interesting
to think, you know how it would affect our
[SPEAKER_03]: child but seeing you know, my partner in
pain and not being able to work or
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally not being able to stand up
straight because she would have to run to
[SPEAKER_03]: the bathroom and throw up Cannabis is what
helped, you know, like literally just a
[SPEAKER_03]: single puff or two would hold her over for
six to eight hours You know, it was
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not like a heavy, you know doses
need It was really even back then it
[SPEAKER_03]: helped me see the medical attributes that
we weren't seeing, you know beyond getting
[SPEAKER_03]: high so my opinion on it is ladies,
I When it comes to the dabbing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I Can't say that I approve of
anything made with solvents because we've
[SPEAKER_03]: yet to see these effects on Infants and I
mean as adults, you know, we we do We do
[SPEAKER_03]: them and you know regardless of whether
it's clean to the state standards and I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean, you know, you've seen the live
resident I mean, we'd love you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I love live resident and 100 pound body
versus that few ounce fetus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah affected completely different
residual solvent Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to that you we can talk
dry sift bubble and at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know unless that Bubble hash or the
full melts has been microbially tested or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like, you know you have to be
Beyond anal about your meds, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't stress that enough,
you know So if we had some clean Rasta
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff grown medicine that you know,
it was clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't sprayed with anything funky It
was grown with love with organic nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I harvested it and I passed it
off to Fox and Fox made Some clean but
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll just stick with the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you approve of pregnant mom smoking
a little flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course and you know my
ex-girlfriend Got pregnant and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: after we got separated it You tear me up
because she was a hardcore dabber and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: like, but at the same time She's a medical
patient or in regard to cancer survivor
[SPEAKER_03]: and she's here, you know having her second
child Who am I to say because I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, then that's the other thing to
that with my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So And she ended up having a beautiful
little girl like just the picture-perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: You know picture of a little beautiful
child and I can't say shit same with my
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter I ended up with a gorgeous little
girl and I'm super grateful and like
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing in my little kids brightest shit,
you know, I'm Super blessed to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: little smart ass knucklehead on my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a smart ass 12 year old daughter
as well Her mom didn't consume much
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis during pregnancy because her
claim was that when she inhales smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: she's depriving the Fetus of oxygen so
that was why she didn't want to smoke but
[SPEAKER_02]: she did have a little bit of a edible if I
remember one time Well, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's been like posts and stuff I've
been seeing I follow some of these mom
[SPEAKER_03]: groups and stuff because of the CBD stuff
obviously and there's obviously a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: posts about the pregnancy and smoking and
fetuses don't They're in the womb,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they their lungs are developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not Taking in oxygen from the from
the air outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking in what mom yeah They would
drown in amniotic fluid right something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's been proven so there goes
that to the debate and I just think with
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that we've been lied to about
cannabis as well, you know, like you know
[SPEAKER_03]: What's upon a time Philip Morris that it
was okay for you to have a smoke,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Yeah, so so to that regard I'd
love for there to be some research done on
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you know I would never in my opinion
would I ever turn away a patient that was
[SPEAKER_03]: pregnant because you're from me and
Because of my opinion now, I would totally
[SPEAKER_03]: do everything I can to offer them the
cleanest meds to dab or smoke or you know
[SPEAKER_03]: Preferably vaporize, you know,
just me personally I would just Go out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the way to suggest the cleanest forms of
medication edibles tinctures Vaporization,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that you can provide I Like your
approach let the women do what women feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like they should do because we are not
women nor doctors Yeah, so to my listener
[SPEAKER_02]: who asked what we feel about it,
I'm trying to Find some information on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not all the information is
conflicting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real studies There are hearsay
studies I think but I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: any like actual this lady smoked all nine
months of her pregnancy and this lady
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't Here's baby a and baby B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's been a study done about
testing breast milk and They took the
[SPEAKER_03]: breast milk of women who never fucking
smoke cannabis in their damn lives alone
[SPEAKER_03]: in the generation like where you're Yeah,
and they found natural cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_03]: breast milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Here's my theory, you know There's
people that don't need to smoke cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: or don't have a big involvement with it
And then I look at them like health wise
[SPEAKER_03]: and they seem to have a healthy
endocannabinoid system that's
[SPEAKER_03]: self-regulating There's no problem,
you know, whatever the case is that's
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously not the case of some of us,
you know as we need to regulate whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: whether we need to work whether we need to
relax whether we need to calm down and we
[SPEAKER_03]: do it with this beautiful plant because
our body's inability and Deficiency of
[SPEAKER_03]: natural reoccurring cannabinoids That can
fall fall under whether we were breast
[SPEAKER_03]: milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other fucking conversation,
but back to my point So there's natural
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids in breast milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't hurt to when you're doing having
clean medicine to enrich and nourish your
[SPEAKER_03]: natural, you know milk to Give your
offspring if it's only building and
[SPEAKER_03]: helping them have better antibodies and
helping them build better You know immune
[SPEAKER_03]: systems and whatnot And also giving them a
better chance of not having deficiencies
[SPEAKER_03]: in those senses So yeah again,
I'm all for more study Yeah of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the main point of life is to
survive So I think once that child's born
[SPEAKER_02]: it will consume that breast milk that
breast milk has cannabinoids in it What
[SPEAKER_02]: happens when you consume a lot of
cannabinoids you get hungrier,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So what are you gonna want to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna want to consume more breast
milk What's that you're gonna do grow
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger get stronger and then what's it
gonna want more breast milk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so hopefully shitty on titty,
but hey great for the baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, yeah Well, so there's my two cents on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if it's like a little awkward
about it, but you know, I like your
[SPEAKER_03]: approach Thank you, you know, I you know,
I'd love to see more research done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see here's what I'd love to
see I'd love to see more moms Justifying
[SPEAKER_03]: the science of it and being more
[SPEAKER_03]: Explaining explaining the situation better
As opposed to just like taking a picture
[SPEAKER_03]: of their tit out and their kids mouth and
like saying that they're you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposing something like do you know,
one cares we're beyond that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to you know, and I'm talking
about cannabis mops Not just mops in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, you know, like I get it and don't
care like free the titty whatever like
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, who's afraid of titties?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, obviously a lot of people are
Terrible people horrible people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: afraid of cannabis exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, dude, you know all for women
doing that with cannabis, you know And
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said, there's some tinctures
fucking transdermals I know of a mom that
[SPEAKER_03]: used like natural hemp products to not get
any fucking stretch marks and she blew up
[SPEAKER_03]: like a damn whale and Didn't stretch her
fucking skin out once and sorry to be
[SPEAKER_03]: blunt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not use her name, but shout out to
cannabis Yeah, and but just saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like even on a hemp CBD scale it
can just help your skin again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can help you have more comfortable
pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not you want to be comfortable,
you know, you want You don't want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: stressed at all at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if cannabis The CBD products,
you know can help you do that and they can
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I think that's a lot better than
I don't really know the science of
[SPEAKER_03]: prenatal drugs, but they make me a little
nervous Yeah, you know with all the
[SPEAKER_03]: vaccinations and all the crazy shit that
we have going on with autism and other
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that It just makes me curious
and nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, go cannabis go cannabis.
