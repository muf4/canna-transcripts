.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make everything nice and easy for all of
my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for those Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do owe you an apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watched the latest YouTube video,
you may have noticed that that video was
[SPEAKER_00]: super grainy and not top quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pride myself on putting out a top
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That video was not top quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I, thanks to Mike for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I recorded via Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looked beautiful on the
computer screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything sounded great.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to process the video and do
the editing, it wasn't great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to can it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to throw that episode away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure you guys got to hear
what Mike and I had to say, mainly what
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike had to say in that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure that got put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my best to clean it up, edit that a
little bit, put that show out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that was not up to Rasta Jeff
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not grow from your heart podcast
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will be better in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to not make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I found the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a way to mitigate that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care what the solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost rambled on about that,
but I found a way to record three
[SPEAKER_00]: different video options and three
different audio options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to piece those three
recordings together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's six different recordings to make a
top shelf podcast out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a backup plan for next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that I failed you on the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the audio, you probably
loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't notice that it was a Zoom
meeting that looked like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of moments where it
did kind of get staticky, but I'm rambling
[SPEAKER_00]: about an apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode was not up to par,
not up to my standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll love my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get the stuff going properly in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for putting up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk about the Edibles episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watched that last episode,
I told you I was going to recap the
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles episode of the Embracing Organics
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Embracing Organics for a
brief moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics is a podcast or a
YouTube show that is, it happens live on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens at 7 PM mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the mountain time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what time it is for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to translate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a Thursday at 7 PM mountain time for
about two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's about 7 10 7 15 because we
like to take a few dabs and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a little after seven until about a
little after nine, we hang out on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: and we talk about growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about all kinds of random chaotic
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one episode of the Embracing Organics
show recently, we did eat a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself ate a 250 milligram dose of
Edibles and we hung out and we tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, by the way, I didn't mention that if
you do miss the live show of Embracing
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics, you can always catch the replay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show stays up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's over, we repost it up to
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch it basically forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So search right now Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff sent you anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the Edibles challenge
episode that I participated in on
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my friends, we all acquired the same
Edibles, the same amount of Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us ate all 250 right at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us kind of dosed ourselves slowly
throughout the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people didn't choose to eat all of
the dosage as I watched a few people just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it all into their mouths at the
start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plan was to eat 50 now, 50 later.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 50 more.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple people threw all 250 in their
mouths and I thought I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: late to the party, so I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ate all 250 right there at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of monstrous dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I ate the 250, I was like,
I'm not super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took a dab that put me on another
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I needed a seatbelt for my
office chair because I felt like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to float away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ate the 250 milligrams of Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I survived the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hung out in the after show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're part of the Embracing Organics
live crew chat, part of their Patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: we hang out with you after.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Patreon, you're invited to come hang
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give you a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can join the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let you hang out and join the video and
we chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a good job hanging out with those
folks after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as I signed out, I ate
everything in the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate everything in the cupboards and then
I slept on the couch until I had to wake
[SPEAKER_00]: up and pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I went back to sleep and it was a
blurry, blurry night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next morning I woke up doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, did I eat all of the food?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate all of the food, drank all of the
drinks, consumed everything in the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked all of the concentrates also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny part was watching a few of my
friends try to manage themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our friends, I may not say
everybody's names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that they want to be called
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to embarrass our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our friends north of the border had
to check out early.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was barbecued.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was over for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a Jamaican friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my Jamaican friend,
Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked like a statue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just, it looked like weekend at
Bernie's at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was laid out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little, he was just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he didn't have such bad cotton mouth,
he would have been drooling on himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe Tanasi handled himself quite
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirtman Dan didn't seem to be very
affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching Keith try to handle, I said I
wasn't going to say their names,
[SPEAKER_00]: but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saying their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to watch the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith was going to stop at a certain
amount of edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was already plenty intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see it on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: His mouth wasn't moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would say words, but his mouth wasn't
making the right shape for those words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny to watch him,
but he's kind of pale.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said if he got so many likes on the
video that he would eat more edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, he said if he got 150,
he would eat the 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we got 200 likes on the video,
he would eat 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be a smart ass and maybe not the
best friend on the planet sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used my social media prowess and I
posted to Facebook saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're on this live video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you post enough likes, my buddy will
eat more edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come give us more likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My Facebook friends came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you guys for coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith ate way too many edibles that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, we got to see who could handle
the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody honestly was wrecked in a dangerous
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that our Canadian friend checked
out early because he was twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did the same thing I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ate way too much food and went to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still talks funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still killing it at life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took a few hours to get him out of
that weed coma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all handled it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I encourage you to check out
The Embracing Organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my medical marijuana card renewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: During COVID times, we are still getting
our medical marijuana cards renewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get appointments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do a lot of things in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email from my cannabis doctor
that said, hey, it's time to renew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to do it over the phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, make an appointment on this
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I clicked on a thing and it said,
here are your times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I picked a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, be ready 10 minutes ahead of time
to fill out a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a text message 10 minutes ahead of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I filled out that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit send.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I hit send, I got a phone call.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the weed doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, hey, why do you need medical
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, have you had medical
marijuana before?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, this is like my 14th or 15th
year of renewing my card.
[SPEAKER_00]: They giggled and they said, cool,
your paperwork is pushed through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me your credit card number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid them for my medical marijuana card,
filled out a couple of papers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the state didn't have a small snafu
with my paperwork, it would have taken a
[SPEAKER_00]: total of two hours to get my medical
marijuana card renewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to leave the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have to put on pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I said, there was a small
technical mistake, not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something was spelled wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just a technical,
the other people, the service I used,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, spelled my name wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is spelled wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically they spelled it correctly,
but it's not the way my full name is
[SPEAKER_00]: spelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that made any sense to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but other than the quick snafu,
it would have taken me a total of maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: two hours to get my weed card renewed,
which is remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, uh, we would make
appointments and you would go to the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor and you would realize that they
just said, sure, come at 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told everybody that called to
come at 11 or whatever time they felt was
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said, come then there were no
appointments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would stand in line, uh, all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'd get there at nine in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get to see the doc at five and they
would sign your paperwork that day and
[SPEAKER_00]: send you on your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to cost, uh, somewhere between
three and $500 to see the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time it was 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to cost 120 to register with the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time it was 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's getting much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole appointment, everything was
$105.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me less than two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have to leave the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically didn't have to put on pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did wear pants just to make you feel
better, but, uh, that was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm good for a solid year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, got my medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really pain-free fucking flawless
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call you and ask you a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then they ask you if you're crazy,
basically, uh, do you have any mental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that would start you suicidal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to hurt yourself or anybody
else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, are you pregnant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have the most of the time,
you know how to answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much easier over the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then when I told her it was my
14th year or 15th year of renewing my
[SPEAKER_00]: card, she just started typing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, we don't need to ask all these
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to go ahead and,
uh, I think you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she re gave me my card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, got the new weed card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my plant count taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not opt for the, uh, increased plant
counts because in Colorado we're limited
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12 plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were going to have a dispensary or
something, grow my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go for the extra plants,
but I don't pay extra for the extended
[SPEAKER_00]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pointless for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just got the regular plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, kind of crush it with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a small grow space anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made those numbers work for the past
couple of years, so didn't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazing how easy it would have been
just to pay for the extended plant count,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, allegedly I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that was the weed card doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to talk about is
congratulations to my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about Cannabuzz all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it quickly right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a social media application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot like, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to clear my throat real
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take a bunch of fat dabs before the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have that dab throw happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm sure you were as tired of it as I
was anyway, Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a social media application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't buy, trade or sell cannabis on
there, but you can post all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis photography, dab videos,
garden shots, all the stuff that the other
[SPEAKER_00]: social media applications will take down
and ban you for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring that shit to Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see your weed picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring your booty picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't bring your booby shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, be cute, but don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's all that there's plenty
of that on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost your weed picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, on Cannabuzz, there was a,
some controversy with the word Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another company was claiming that they had
a copyright on the word buzz and Cannabuzz
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't use Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they had to hire a lawyer,
uh, not to toot my own horn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my best to help with the
contributions for the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the lawyer covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few other people helped as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were auctions, there were raffles
and things like that that helped cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my best to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a lot of Cannabuzz family,
ivory army, grow from your heart gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all helped out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You helped out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But had to get a lawyer, had to fight a
copyright lawsuit and congratulations to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz because they won the
motherfucking lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They own the name Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can take it from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trademark lawsuit is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're keeping it good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm happy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to change the name of the
app, which would have been a total pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have to change branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys catch a buzz, join us over on,
I probably don't even know that catch a
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is something I can say that's probably
somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not Q go up, go copyright that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the community at Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm on Cannabuzz a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nearly 60,000 Cannabuzz
followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of shit on Cannabuzz post a
lot, do a lot of, uh, interaction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am ivory underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to say congrats to my friends
because that has been an uphill battle and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it's finally over for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, next I want to give a special shout
out to a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's a business partner, but more
importantly, he's a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, he is a good fucking
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to my friend
James Bean from seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a plug for seeds here now,
but do make sure to check out seeds here
[SPEAKER_00]: now.com and use coupon code G F Y H 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the important part here is that we
acknowledge an outstanding person,
[SPEAKER_00]: an excellent member of the cannabis
community and my friend James Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kissing his ass or doing anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode talking about a person
who was leaving their partner by behind
[SPEAKER_00]: because their morals, their ideas and
their grow room ethics changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our viewer, our friend, uh,
wanted some advice and some guidance,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically some reassurance and some
affirmation that they were doing the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that person and gave them
some guidance on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, my business partner,
James Bean sent me a message and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that person is an awesome person and
I would like to give them a reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, James Bean, that is admirable of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, you deserve a big high five,
a salute, a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've got my respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already had my respect, but I want to
make it known to the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: how good of a person you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you run a solid business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you talk a solid game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're amazing on podcasts, but people may
not know the truth that deep down inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a good fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got your back because you've
always got my back and you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: communities back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to take a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out James Bean from seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also if you're the person that sent me
that message, uh, check your email or send
[SPEAKER_00]: me another email because, uh, we would
like to help you out for being such a good
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure to acknowledge my
friend, James Bean, dude, I do appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community does appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the part of the show where we
are going to read the listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got cotton mouth so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I took so many fat dabs right
before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a sip of this kombucha
recompose myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to read the listener
emails here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a drink, sip something with me,
hydrate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag sips tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not editing that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the first email on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one is titled shout out question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from, actually, I just grabbed
this from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said, I joined the Patreon
approximately two weeks ago and I still
[SPEAKER_00]: have not gotten a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friend crazy hand replied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a YouTube comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy hand replied to the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I feel he does it randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have never heard mine on a shout out
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he did me a solid and gave me a
special shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, my RNG is always bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what RNG stands for,
but, um, uh, so mainly the question here
[SPEAKER_00]: is, uh, somebody said they signed up for
Patreon approximately two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't given them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this person actually did get their
shout out shortly after this comment was
[SPEAKER_00]: posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you contribute to Patreon, sometimes it
does take me a minute to give you a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recorded one solid week ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do two shows a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to record both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so if the show that comes out Tuesday
was recorded last Tuesday, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the show that comes out Thursday was
recorded the Tuesday before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm several days ahead, just in case
something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have to get on the mic and
record a show Thursday, edit it,
[SPEAKER_00]: post it, hope it comes out on YouTube on
time on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we got to wait for the episodes to
come out in the order in which they come
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the COVID times, uh, with fucking
life the way that it is, I try to be at
[SPEAKER_00]: least one or two episodes ahead so that if
something does go wrong in my life,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one or two loaded up in the can
is what we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got a couple loaded up that I can
launch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something's wrong with me, if
something's wrong with my gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: if my internet's down, I've got a backup
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you send me the message on the
first saying, Hey, I'm a patron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write it down on the first, maybe I'll
record on the third or fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then that will come out till the
seventh, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe I recorded two episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the second episode that month
that I record.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get your shout out
till the 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the third.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the 13th of the month
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just about the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down the shout outs and then I
record them through the month and it may
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, I'm getting, uh, I don't want to
complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting an overwhelming amount of
shout outs and amount, uh, overwhelming
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of contributions and response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do 10 shout outs at the top of
every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay attention now, sometimes it's
12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I extend it to 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the names are short and I can sneak it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went from 10 shout outs every
episode to 12 or 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may, and I can't make you a promise
because my time is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to step it up and do a third
episode just to get the Patreon shout outs
[SPEAKER_00]: in every month, which if I can find
another, uh, one more evening to record,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to give you a third episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can get the content, if you guys
can send me more questions and shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get that third episode
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make the adjustments, but that may
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the main issue is that you're,
I get the Patreon notice on the first of
[SPEAKER_00]: the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put out eight episodes every
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get your shout out on that eighth
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just go down the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just picked the seven 10 club and I
just start writing their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually type them into the computer and
I just read them as they come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, sometimes people get snuck in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a special circumstance,
like if it's your birthday or if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to Patreon today and you're
brand new, maybe I'll put you on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, uh, they're random.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, I get the notifications on the
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get them all done by the end of
the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I continue them through the next
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be 10, excuse me,
used to be 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's 12 or 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to do that third episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to adjust my schedule for that
third episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys podcasting isn't as easy as it
looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to, uh, I got to write the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got editing to do afterward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it takes a long time for YouTube to
post it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the same with the questions,
if you've sent me your questions on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon on the first, and I haven't read
it by the second, please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take me a few weeks to get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recorded ahead at least two episodes,
and I've got questions lined up for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least four or five episodes already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm written ahead, recorded ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do respect your questions, your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, keep in mind, there are a lot of you
and there's only one of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a one man podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody behind the scenes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am the writer, editor, director,
producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be patient with me, but don't
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do no pressure, no diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you don't keep me, uh, going,
I get lazy idle hands or the devil's
[SPEAKER_00]: playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys please keep me overloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inspires me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking high and rambly, but let's
keep it on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from Jackie Daytona and it said,
no, actually this one came from YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: came from Jackie Daytona on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said, Hey Jeff, thanks again for
the great info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a thought when you were explaining
Nanner's in a previous episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about Nanner's, uh,
hermaphroditic male flowers and female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's what I was calling Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says people love visuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love visuals too, but I think you have
something different in mind in this
[SPEAKER_00]: question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you mean visual aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and sometimes a pop-up photo can
show a good example of what you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been putting in photos right
about here, uh, somewhere here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: region in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been learning a lot more with my
editing equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of, uh, other ideas that
may happen here in the future to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some more, uh, visual aids, but,
uh, it says Nanner's herms, male,
[SPEAKER_00]: female parts, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: People obviously can just Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it could really add a new dynamic
to your already great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for generous knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, Jackie Daytona, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love constructive criticism,
uh, positive or negative feedback as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as they're done politely or both taken
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very, very accurate and very
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have posted a picture of a plant
with a Nanner right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a missed opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job on catching that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so now's a good time to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, never too late, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better late than never is what I think my
brain is trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I'm going to pop up a
couple of photos here on the screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk once again about
Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the episode about
Nanner's, here is a great visual
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to show you is a female
cannabis plant that is late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very well developed flower and
you will see that in the very center of
[SPEAKER_00]: this flower, there are two yellow things
that just don't look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping out of the center of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put the picture right here on
the screen and right here in the center,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I'll try to circle it or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to learn the software so I can't
promise you what's going to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll do something to indicate right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part that I'm showing is what I'm
calling the Nanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see why we call that the banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got buds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the female, uh, pistols is what
you may want to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the female clearly see that
it's a female, but we see a couple of male
[SPEAKER_00]: parts in the middle of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we call an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we call a hermaphrodite
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those Nanner's contain pollen
and that pollen can pollinate your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this plant is way too far beyond
pollination point for that to be an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you've got younger plants in the
room, that plant could receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what we call a Nanner that
could or could not contain pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they have pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they do not have pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they have pollen that is non
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what a Nanner looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to scroll through my iPad here
and find another picture and explain this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this one, the thing that looks
like a tongue sticking out of the bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like a yellow tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Nanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a male flower sticking out of a
female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we have got a hermaphrodite
and intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant, the past two shots that I
showed you, there would be a decision to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no pollen coming out of those
Nanner's, if you're running one crop on
[SPEAKER_00]: one cycle that has no chance of getting
pollinated, you may keep that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of late Nanner's and late flower
may not be detrimental to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it happens early, that's when I get rid
of them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it happens in week one or week two,
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week four, five and six, I'd probably get
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week eight, I would consider keeping that
bad dog because the flowers are so far
[SPEAKER_00]: into bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so far into ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female parts which would receive that
pollen are so recessed and dried up that
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant won't receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant with this tongue looking
male pollen sac sticking out, if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the fire, if that's really good cannabis
and it only makes one or two of those on
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire plant, I may consider keeping
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a clear picture of a Nanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call this one a tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a new word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a tongue in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to scroll through my iPad and
see what my next photo is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next photo which I'm going to show you
is a very clear shot of a cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with male and female sex parts clearly
displayed in one single bud set of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lower bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the female parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little hair that we see coming off
here, a lot of people call it the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, a lot of people are going to
call it pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are stigmas or pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have said stamens a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have said stamen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I said stamen talking
about the female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stigmas and pistols is what those are
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little hairy parts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other part that's opened up that
looks like a seashell that opened or a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that bloomed, that is a male
cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part that opened up, the pollen was
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have contained pollen that is now
all over the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part is actually the stamen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part there is the stamen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It popped open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have shot pollen all over the
plants next to this, the female parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pistols and the stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: May have been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a plant with clear intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a male flower, a male pollen
sack, which has been opened and we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the female stigmas or pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very good shot to show you a
male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to scroll through my iPad
and see what I've got next.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next photo is another shot of a male
and a female flower on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're early into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great way to show you what a
male flower is going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a guy who is holding a small
part of a plant to indicate what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part here that looks like a pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is seed shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bean shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a male flower and that thing is a
day or two away from opening up and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating the rest of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's big and beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out just a little more
and protrude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will point down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will open up and pollen will come
out of that pollen sack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very clear male pollen sack.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, further up the plant,
the little bud that we see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got those female parts, those little,
the things you guys like to call hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: those stigmas and pistols that are
sticking off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a clear female part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see, I can see swollen
calyxes or swollen bracts, which I will
[SPEAKER_00]: assume are seeded already or are
developing seeds or will develop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very clear shot of a
hermaphroditic plant, a male female
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think I've made it clear what
male, this part right here, that is a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part, not a male plant, that is a
male part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant showed that, it is probably
a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got these hairy parts up here,
that's what we're looking for in a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to post a solid picture of a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll post a solid picture of a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've seen what the intersex
plants look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've made it clear what nanners look
like, what males look like, what females
[SPEAKER_00]: look like, what intersex plants look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should help you out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that you should not get paranoid
about are swollen bracts or swollen
[SPEAKER_00]: calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at a cannabis plant,
the parts that develop are calyxes and
[SPEAKER_00]: bracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those look like they're swollen
and they look like they are male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be at the bottom of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a little branch and at the
bottom of the bud, it'll start to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have little balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those could be swollen bracts or calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too excited and get too quick to
cut down a plant that is showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: female parts because you think it may be a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verify, make sure that it's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the intersections, at the nodes is
where you're most likely to see the first
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of male sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing those balls in the buds,
that is probably a swollen calyx or a
[SPEAKER_00]: bract that is just swollen because it's
developing the way it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let your mind play tricks on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, don't cut down a
female because you've mistaken it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted, Hey guys, I need and gals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a photo of hermaphroditic plants
and I especially need a shot with some
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanners in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all of my friends who sent
me pictures of plants with Nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I did with hell withhold their names
to protect the innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say, Hey, my buddy,
Jim has hermaphroditic plants in his
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt it would be best to keep those
names, uh, to myself, keep those people
[SPEAKER_00]: protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may also show at the end of the video,
I may just pop up a few more pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plants because I did get a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank all of my friends who
sent me all of the marvelous intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so many, uh, some of them made me
sick to my stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were exactly what I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I thought it was great that I had to
reach out and ask for pictures of intersex
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a breeder, you'd think I'd have
that, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I just didn't take enough pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't take pics of our fuck-ups,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You only take pictures of the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to quit
rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nice and high before this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you for putting up with
my rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for putting up with
their throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once again, I apologize for that last
episode, but I want to thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to another successful episode of
the girl from your heart podcast.
