[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm doing something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't press record during the
dab session before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, I have decided to press record
right before I dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take this dab and then we might
jump into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may end up editing this part of the show
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am heating up the dab nail right now,
getting it nice and warm for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a big fat dab lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that dab in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awkward because I'm trying to work
the dab torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to hold the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my dab prepared and also I've got
a microphone in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a new obstacle to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure I can figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the nail hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and hot now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a couple of seconds just to cool
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a carb cap within reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my concentrate within reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to work out, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have faith in this endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we were at the right
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, dab with me and then
we will do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am seriously lit as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a fun way to start a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to kind of get my brain together
and catch my breath, but let's get it
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode four.
[SPEAKER_00]: 91 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show was brought to
you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a regular listener of the show,
you know I like to start the podcast off
[SPEAKER_00]: by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what I just dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of lysergic
lemon live batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of sour best lemons and
sour animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard about the sour animal in the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package of the lysergic lemons,
the flavor is described as lemon meringue,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner and funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to agree with all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You immediately get that lemon meringue in
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, punch of lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a sharp astringent cleaner
flavor and it's pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it may not be good,
but it is definitely delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, I get a gross,
delicious, funky lemon cleaner sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to that grossness of
lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of garlicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of armpit-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gross and deliciously
disgusting, but it's all topped off with
[SPEAKER_00]: this wonderful lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the best part is this stuff gets
me high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some concentrates get me stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some give me a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just makes me fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could tell over the past
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gotten more energized and more
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one makes me want to run laps,
makes me want to go play my drums,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me want to ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be delicious and wonderful
podcast concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says the
product does contain 65.65% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that was a fun way to start a
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do more dabs on the show like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to do a strain
update or a strain review.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people enjoy those strain
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a couple of requests for one
specific strain and it's time to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to our friends who support the show
[SPEAKER_00]: on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to

[SPEAKER_00]: you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: pimps and hoes, smokers and growers,
all you bad motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great email asking about a
specific strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason to waste time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this email so we can
start a strain review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from our friend in
Toronto, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, big up for all of the mad
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got authorization for 50 plants for
medical usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, 50 plants for medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes on to say I just ordered some of
your Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that the parents would give a
crazy contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ordered these beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you did some research and that
you were intrigued by the parents and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were excited to see what's going to
come out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the type of grower that becomes a
breeder in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the type of passion that leads to
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you could please give me a
brief description of the phenos I may
[SPEAKER_00]: expect and any other tips with growing
this strain, it would be much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spreading your name and love across
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay good, never synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign it with their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, big shout out, big respect to my
new friend up there in Toronto,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked for a brief description of
Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what I call a brief description.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention before I get
too far into this is I have been notified
[SPEAKER_00]: and I am aware that there is another
breeder who is using the name Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think that breeder may have
had it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I didn't do my proper research and
do my due diligence as a breeder who
[SPEAKER_00]: releases seeds for commercial purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let that seed strain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They posted pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tagged it Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other breeder went, hey, motherfucker,
that's my strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people that bought Hellfire OG,
you got really lucky because I am not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gotten rid of the female plant that
I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have discontinued that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not making any more of those seeds so
that I don't fuck with that guy's other
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to change the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also feels shifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a limited batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I made is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few packs left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got very few 10 packs left myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some fucking hold onto it or
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some, get it quickly because
it will be gone very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will not make any more because I
stole somebody else's name and that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not going to be made anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that breeder hears this, bro,
I know I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stop making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get off of that soap box and
we'll move forward and actually talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I call it Hellfire OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is a cross of Hell's OG and
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell's OG is also known as Biker Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell's OG is also known as Hell's Angels
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a long story of dispensaries in
Colorado having Hell's Angels OG on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf and the actual Hell's Angels
organization sent them a letter from their
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyer requesting they change the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Hell's Angels OG was no longer
called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got called either Hell's OG or Biker
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that got spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired a clone of the Hell's OG from a
good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided that it was an awesome plant,
but it could use some improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I decided to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had many great desirable traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, so does my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of like a match made in
heaven as a plant breeder, as a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see things in certain plants and I go,
ooh, if those plants right there bred
[SPEAKER_00]: together, they would make amazing
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit that sometimes I'm wrong as
shit and we throw large quantities of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds away or we feed them to the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time I strike gold with
most of my intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get my high ass back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hellfire OG is a cross of Hell's OG to my
Arise male who is known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I name a cross, I try to honor the
parent strain or keep some of the lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: in the name to make it sort of obvious
what the cross came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hellfire was an obvious name for Hell's
OG to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also thought about calling it the
Phoenix, but I think the Phoenix is
[SPEAKER_00]: already taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a Steel Pulse song called
Earth Crisis and one of the lines he just
[SPEAKER_00]: says, Hellfire, and that's part of where
it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, yes, I listen to a lot of reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I name a lot of my strains after Grateful
Dead, after reggae type inspired sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where my mind is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my names are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, of course, I like cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the TMNT stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also allegedly maybe some G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe named stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my brain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like Arise and Horizon,
those are just one word, positive names
[SPEAKER_00]: that look good on packaging and sound nice
and are memorable and words that stick
[SPEAKER_00]: with you and are uplifting words.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my name schemes come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the name Hellfire OG comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Hell's OG female to my male Arise,
also known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a little more info about the
Hell's OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a cross of OG Kush and Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew that, I thought it smelled
like gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds very cliche,
but it's Hell's OG because it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells straight cushy like what Kush is
supposed to smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some pine to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some dirty feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a bunch of gas to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it grows, it grows rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are just straight, dense,
hard rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes little pine cone type rocks,
maybe some golf balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a huge yielder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the problem, in my opinion,
with the Hell's OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put out very high quality product,
but it put out kind of stringy,
[SPEAKER_00]: thin plants with not huge buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted just a better producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought maybe I could carry that
aroma and that frost right into the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny and kind of increase the
productivity and the production of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, make it a better plant for a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's a little bit of info on
the father, which was an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep calling him King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to my podcast a lot,
you know that King Solomon is used in many
[SPEAKER_00]: of my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Golden Goat female pollinated by
a Day Breaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day Breaker is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got Chem Dog and OG Kush in there
to give you that real funky aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the pollen from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it on a Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That created Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected a very unique male out of that
batch of plants and I have named him King
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that as my main stud breeding male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a fucking champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I put pollen on from King
Solomon turns into gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It improves everything I breed it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fixes problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases potency and vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is a magical plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I use it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit more about
this Hellfire OG cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, I really enjoyed
the aromas and flavors and the buzz of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell's OG, but it did not live up to
expectations and standards for a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal was to increase the vigor and
kind of increase the harvest weight and
[SPEAKER_00]: yields of the Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to keep the gas and dank and Kush
skunky tennis ball flavors and aromas in
[SPEAKER_00]: that cross and I feel like I achieved that
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of the fresh tennis ball,
fresh tires, cushy, gassy, dirty feet sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of aromas coming from many of the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have a sweet bubble gum,
maybe juicy fruit gum or some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tropical candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from them on the back end after
that cushy smell and that's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Golden Goat side of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we've got so many earthy and
cushy flavors, most of them are very
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated by that feely, earthy,
kush, fresh tennis ball, maybe some fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: sneakers kind of an aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a place in California called the
Norwalk indoor swap meet and very few
[SPEAKER_00]: people have probably been there that
listen to this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think sometimes some dank weed has a
hint of the smell of some of the shoes at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Norwalk indoor swap meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, possibly, some of those booths
may have some knockoff Air Jordans and
[SPEAKER_00]: they smell really unique and that is sort
of sometimes what some of this Kush smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about specific phenotypes and
stuff like that in a moment, but I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the buzz that comes from most
of the phenotypes from the Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a heavy smoker and I like potent
cannabis and potent extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I do smoke concentrates,
but if I go to a concert, if I go
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere, I'll roll up a couple of joints
and take those with me so I can enjoy them
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm out doing whatever I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to smoke a joint of whatever I
just bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I breed something new, I grow a bunch
of those seeds and then I get to smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get that first flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've created this potential masterpiece or
a potential disaster, so I've got to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: my finger in there and see what it tastes
like so that I can assure that I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product before I serve it to the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I grew out some Hellfire
OG, I grew it, I dried it, I cured it,
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed it up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rolled it up into a big fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lit it up and everybody went,
damn, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first thing that people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you light up a joint of some good
weed, they go, oh, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took a couple of puffs off of it
and I passed it around the room and it
[SPEAKER_00]: came back and I took a couple of puffs off
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I noticed I'm fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hellfire OG brings that OG Kush potency
that just punches you in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I call it time travel weed or tunnel
vision weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the word fated came from,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you used to hear people say,
bro, I'm fated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they might have smoked some good
OG Kush and they might have possibly had
[SPEAKER_00]: some Hellfire OG because you just get
fated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your peripheral vision is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get tunnel vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only focus on what's right in
front of you and you can barely focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that just stoned tunnel vision,
just straight to the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking forgot where my keys are and
they're in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for my sunglasses and I'm
wearing them still.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of herb that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Hellfire OG brings that punch to
the face potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that in some herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That good dank flavor and that punch to
the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often when people say, recommend
your cushiest, gaseous strain to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hellfire and the Liberation are the
two that I recommend for gas and dank and
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know how it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that you're gonna get fucking lit
when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
growing aspects of the Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're gonna grow this, what should and
could we expect from this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of distinct phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, unfortunately, grow tall and
they are quite stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will take off at the
beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any OG Kush, they take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to get rather tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do some popping and twisting and
some lollipopping and maybe some trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: work and that will prevent the stretch,
but they will stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one to push products on my
podcast, but something that will help you
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the amount of stretch in the first
21 days of your flowering process is a
[SPEAKER_00]: product called Decision from New
Millennium Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells those plants, quit stretching,
start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that when you initiate flower and it
will reduce the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you do some popping and twisting
of the stems, which I'm going to do an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode on very soon, when you do that
popping and twisting at the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, the plants don't have the energy
to stretch because they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: repair their cellular structure that you
just broke, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to disrupt that structure so that
they build fatter, thicker, more robust
[SPEAKER_00]: stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they don't stretch as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We slow down that growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get thicker and they don't get
taller, which is what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a way to prevent that stretch
with some of this OG Kush stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to get tall on you,
so be prepared for tall, kind of lanky,
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy plants with a little bit of
stretchy internodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be worried if they look stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just what these plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see a phenotype that gets
gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant with gigantic fan
leaves that you could have a nice shady
[SPEAKER_00]: spot underneath on a hot sunny day,
if those leaves are continuously droopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is not a problem with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is not thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has not had too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait that comes from the
daybreaker father.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is actually the grandfather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming from the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big fat purple leaves that
are droopy, that is just a trait that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally that happens with the darker
green phenotypes, almost a purple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the darker colored leaves
may get a little bit droopier on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is fun to grow because it does
turn a lot of great colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get purple on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some oranges in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some like tints of yellow
toward the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of neat watching this one change
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the main phenotypes that you will see
are what I call the golf ball phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is very representative of almost
any OG Kush family plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a lot of OG Kush in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing big fat golf balls,
just fist size golf balls up your stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make long fat colas,
but every one of those golf balls is just
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in frosty trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get the golf ball
phenotype, and then you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the more desirable one, the big cola
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will know the difference about
four or five weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, yep, those are golf balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a fucking monster cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's what happens with most
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow the golf ball phenotype,
it is going to be covered in trichomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one doesn't have as much frost,
but it tastes just as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to make the decision
between, do I want this super fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty plant or do I want more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that is the, then when it comes to
being a connoisseur grower, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a hard decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for personal use,
you probably want that golf ball
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to take this to a
production facility, if you're a cash
[SPEAKER_00]: cropper, if you're looking to profit in
any way, you probably want that big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: cola phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both going to have beautiful bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only person who is going to notice a
difference on the other end is the grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the person trying to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is going to give you quite a bit more
product than the other, and it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes I do see a phenotype that
is a little bit squattier and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: pointier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may sound strange, but when you
see them lined up, you'll go, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: squatty pointy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That short squattier phenotype in my
opinion is expressed in a lot of golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it is showing a lot of Romulan
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one finishes a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are going to finish
around 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Romulan dominant phenotype will
finish closer to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it lacks that dank cushy funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more like a sweet golden goat cush
sort of across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the most desirable sought after
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is something I want to mention
that I've been thinking about when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to talking about phenotypes and
identifying phenotypes for my people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are buying my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to seek the phenotypes
that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to seek the phenotypes which
you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype that grows best in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype that does best for your
medical or recreational needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype that does best for your
cash crop needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that suits your desires.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the one that is kind of stretchy,
the one that makes the golf ball buds that
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like dirty feet and armpits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I would go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a cash crop,
you're going to tell me to go fuck myself
[SPEAKER_00]: with that one because you're not going to
make any profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the connoisseur headstache plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the other one that makes the big
gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I notice the girls really
prefer the phenotype that is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeter and golden goat dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not being sexist towards the
women.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put out multiple jars and I say,
take your pick, the ladies will tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick the sweeter smelling product most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my observation from paying
attention to offering products to
[SPEAKER_00]: different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That golden goat dominant phenotype is
more desirable for the ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to picking your
phenotypes, take my advice on what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heed my words on what is coming from those
packages and how you can adjust your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: to that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't seek a phenotype based on my
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like me trying to say, bro,
you really want to go to this restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: and get this meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be a steak eater.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I send you to my favorite restaurant,
you're going to leave pissed off and
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry and I'm going to do the same at
your favorite restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find that phenotype that works best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get my high ass back on track here
and talk about Hellfire OG a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you can count on with all
phenotypes of Hellfire OG is that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to want more Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the OG Kush varietals are going to
be happier with more Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want more Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this one may go nutrient deficient
on you late in flower if you don't feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying to overdose it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying to keep a good eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of tapering off your nutrients
toward the end of flower, you may need to
[SPEAKER_00]: ride them out an extra week and make sure
this plant does not run out of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I say this about many of the strains
that I breed because King Solomon makes
[SPEAKER_00]: tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I extra mean it with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need multiple layers of supports
when you're growing Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tall, lanky, skinny plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need some supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow it properly, hopefully you
need two, maybe three or four layers of
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would spread it out really far with that
first net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread it really far and wide and then let
it grow up into that second net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then flip it into flower and put up a
third net because it is going to grow into
[SPEAKER_00]: that third layer of trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for tall, stretchy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hellfire OG is probably not a plant I
would recommend for beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have never grown an OG Kush or Chem
Dog type varietal, you may want some
[SPEAKER_00]: practice with something a little less
finicky than the Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG Kush genetics in this plant give
you a little bit of a challenge when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't want as much water as
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they need a lower pH than your
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said a moment ago, Hellfire OG
is certainly going to want more Kalmag
[SPEAKER_00]: than most of your other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those things are true for most
OG Kush type varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find those things true
with almost anything OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't grown OG before,
it is a special experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow like most of your other
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want as much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little bit stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a lot more work, but they are
very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time period here in Colorado
when all you could find was some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've talked about this on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, during that time period,
people were just slapping the words OG and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush on every strain in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went to the dispensary on Friday
before Kush got super popular and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 different strains and none of them had
the words OG or Kush in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the weekend, Kush got popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went back on Monday and now they had
12 different Kushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just relabeled everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does happen, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this industry, let me get back on track
again because this lysergic lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate has got me fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is that OG Kush type cultivars
are very challenging to grow, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to take some of the challenge out
of the Hell's OG by breeding it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise, but unfortunately it kept that
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it is worth the struggle
because the final product is very
[SPEAKER_00]: rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromas, the flavors, the kick to the
face type of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is all very, very much worth
the extra work you have to put in when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing some OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say this part, it sounds like
I'm just bragging and making shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly recommend extra carbon
filters when you're growing Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very skunky, very stanky,
very fuely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in an area where growing
is not welcome and accepted, somebody is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to smell your Hellfire OG and they
may talk about it because it is stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make your eyes burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I trim it, I'm not sure if it's
making me tear up with pride or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: making my eyes burn because it's so
stanky, but it definitely does something
[SPEAKER_00]: to my face while I'm trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep your CalMag dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep your vapor pressure
deficit proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants don't want a dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a little bit of a damp
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get dry in the air,
but do let them get dry in the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not like to be overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not kill an OG Kush varietal by
underwatering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are much more likely to kill an OG
Kush plant by overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when it comes to Kush
type varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hellfire OG also tends to like lower
pH, and she also really enjoys kelp type
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the kelp really brings out the
aromas and the stanky feet flavors from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hellfire OG that will also help you
lower the pH of your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often talk about defoliating in a
commercial grow and also in a small scale
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not defoliate the Hellfire OG as
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remove some of those amazingly large
leaves, but I don't take off a lot of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: because she does not respond well to
excessive defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the rare exceptions in my
lineup where I will say do not defoliate
[SPEAKER_00]: her too heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will piss her off.
[SPEAKER_00]: She makes those gigantic leaves,
so you don't have a lot of opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's bigger than my hand, I tend to
pull it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not much bigger than that,
I like to leave it there and just let it
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toward the end of the flowering phase,
these plants will turn some amazing dark
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get blacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some silvers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some red and yellows on the
leaves before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors that come from these plants are
very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a photographer, you'll get
those cliche bud shot pictures around
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks five, six, and seven, but around
weeks eight and nine, when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing and then into week 10,
you will have some amazing photo
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities with some amazing colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also noticed that Hellfire OG
appreciates lower temperatures toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too extreme because you will have
big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to risk getting powdery
mildew, but if you can drop your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature slowly toward the end of
flower and get kind of cold at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, maybe even reduce the lights
toward the end of the flowering cycle also
[SPEAKER_00]: helps speed up and create some density in
the Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned before that most
phenotypes will take nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of outliers that do
take closer to eight weeks, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the non-desirable phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can reduce that flowering time
if you reduce the amount of light hours
[SPEAKER_00]: during the flush cycle instead of running
12, 12 or 11, 13, maybe drop it down to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a couple of days later, put it down
to eight hours of light and then harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tricks you can do to speed up
the end cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also add a little bit of density I don't
recommend that 24 or 48 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I do, but you can
reduce the overall amount of darkness that
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant gets every day that will help
speed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm sure you've heard me talk about
increasing the light toward the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle to kind of make your
plants beef up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I recommend for more
advanced growers who know what to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: and can pay attention to their plants so
that if they do experience any problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can cut down right away and not have
any terrible outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is experimentation and that is
for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial grow and you've
got multiple tables and multiple cycles in
[SPEAKER_00]: one room, that's what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go 12, 12 all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the opportunity,
maybe you'll cut it down to 10 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: daylight and have 14 hours of darkness for
a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll kick it down to eight hours
of daylight and then you'll have 16 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of darkness just for the last couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe for the last week to 10 days,
you can turn your timer back on to 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: six and try to speed up the end cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to add on a little bit of bulk there
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all experiments that you have to
do in your own garden to dial in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style, your phenotype and your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are options that are always
there to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, I feel like I got on a
[SPEAKER_00]: good ramble for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we learned a lot about Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, I will not be making
any more Hellfire OG seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are made are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got a few packs left myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested, they are available
at seeds here now dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also may have a few packs set aside for
the endo expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me early before they disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think that covers
my strain review for Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed that.

[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the things you need in life may
be difficult, not all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon ain't feeling good, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got problem at home
domestically, and my girl, she just want
[SPEAKER_01]: to call me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love is the order of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my problems behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm so confident in myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing or no one that could get
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even the damn system solicit properly
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very entry and living happily.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those Babylonians mess with us today,
the music will play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smoke my problems away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and a couple of my friends were just
chilling on the corner, listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: music from Jamaica to Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to go link the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need something for the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy as a lark when the good vibes stir
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the chanting starts, you get burning
fuel corrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke all day and still we got the
earth to rub up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't the Babylonian rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give thanks for the stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep the meditation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music and more music will burn the vegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ifs, no buts, no argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is my holy sacrament.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks and praise high desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: All when Babylonians going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastaman still requests a hundred pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blows up the solace and we bust it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm about myself, I'll go smoke it
alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the spoon to make you drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It make you rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the diesel go easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got enough for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the hydro to rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the things you need in life may
be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all the time it's going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always go smoke the marijuana and get
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pagans ain't feeling good well and that's
the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got problem at home
domestically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my lady just wanna quarrel with me and
smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love is harder and the day you gotta find
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big man and I put my problem behind
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
