[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Show Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 372 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Banana OG
Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, it says it is $80,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 3.2% THC and a total of 97% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of a change from what I usually
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like a concentrate that makes my
head spin, makes my eyes vibrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it hard to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Banana OG is kind of more of a mellow
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me kind of chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my eyes nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my shoulders nice and chilled out
and I really dig the flavor of the Banana
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are taking dabs of
something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you can tell, but I still
have a little bit of that head cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to let it slow me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to deliver a quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I plan to bring you
another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the grow lesson,
I've got a couple of quick things to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am iRegenetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently doing some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the process of updating the
website, something went completely
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking wrong and the podcast does not
work from the website anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the episodes that were up before
the update are still accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the new things I add to the
website are posting to the RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My web guy is working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the holiday weekend, so he has taken
a few days off, but I'm sure he will get
[SPEAKER_00]: back on it as soon as the weekend is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, I know the website is messed
up and I apologize for not having the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes out on iTunes and Stitcher as
regularly scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just recently bragging about not
missing a Monday in five years and now
[SPEAKER_00]: here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've missed at least one Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I may potentially miss two
Mondays in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the episodes are recorded and the
shows are posted on YouTube, so I have not
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't stopped doing the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just unable to post them to iTunes and
Stitcher because of a glitch with my
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be patient with me and please
keep listening to the show and please find
[SPEAKER_00]: the show on YouTube if that is your only
option of listening for the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also real quick, I want to give a
shout out to the guy who works on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he listens to the show
regularly or at all, but hey, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, man, big thanks for keeping the
website updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for all the updates lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also big thanks for getting it fixed
when you do get the RSS feed back in
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, since I'm giving shout outs,
let's give some shout outs to a few of our
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to Jade.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big Patreon shout out to
Grimble the Druid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a Patreon shout out to Tanner
Martinovich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, another shout out to my
friend Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you for all of the
Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier this was going to be
another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in my series of grow lessons,
we should have plants that are probably 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 14, maybe 16 or 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably in three or five or
maybe seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they are nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a fat root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they're pest free at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you haven't over or under
fertilized them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a lot about the proper
environment and conditions and feeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we know how to take care of
them by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a few ways to improve our
productivity and the vigor of our large
[SPEAKER_00]: veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, none of this stuff is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this stuff is mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the little tips and tricks and
bonus things that I do to boost
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and boost vigor to kind of
turbocharge the overall performance of my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: One really easy thing I like to do to all
of my plants to increase performance is
[SPEAKER_00]: just clean off the crap on the bottoms of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a stalk coming out of the dirt
and then you've got a few crappy branches
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off the bottom and then the next
couple of branches will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial and then you'll have some
solid branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those very bottom branches are crappy,
don't be afraid to remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they are a waste of
growth on the plant, feel free to take
[SPEAKER_00]: them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to lollipop heavily once we
go into flower, so don't be afraid to move
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the crappy bottom branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a long, healthy branch that has
the potential to reach the canopy level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's ugly, if it's droopy,
if it's sucking up energy and not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce anything that would be worthwhile,
feel free to take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that plant can focus its energy
moving up toward the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: where we want to build that lush canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to take crap off of the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've removed the crappy bottom
branches that are kind of a waste of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another thing we can do to the
bottom section of our plant to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance and move the energy up toward
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've still got bottom branches because we
left some of those bottom branches on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside bottom branching is not going
to receive much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is find that branch
and just follow it up and remove any
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots that I feel like are a waste of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a thick arm coming off and
then off of that, you'll have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny sub arm coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are on the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a waste of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to turn into buds we do
not want to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be fluffy, larpy,
useless little crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a trimmer's nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing that crap from the bottom,
we direct the energy up toward the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make bigger top chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are better for trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are better for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are better for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants those big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's clean off that crap off the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the main stock coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your bottom two,
your bottom four branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow those branches up and where you
don't see any light touching those little
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots, feel free to just pinch them or
cut them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're cutting or pinching or
cleaning stuff off of plants, always keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back later and take more off,
but you cannot glue the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots back onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that bottom section, just pull that
crap in the inside right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go fairly hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom parts of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on lolly popping heavily early in
flower anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not pull off a lot of that crap now
and send the energy up toward the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're cleaning the bottoms of
the plants, keep in mind that it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: wise to take some clones before we put
these plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to grow next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing from seed that you spent a
lot of money on?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you paid a lot of money for those
seeds, I definitely recommend you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone off of each seedling and market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about this in depth in
a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a plant from seed,
I recommend you take a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark that plant, plant A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark your clone, clone A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on down the line with every seedling
plant that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either grow out the clone or grow out the
original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got something amazing,
now you have got a keeper clone of that to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that sort of
stuff in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we are cleaning the bottoms of our
plants, do you want to use those two
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom branches may make excellent clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those shoots may have grown big
enough to turn into a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind while you're cleaning up
the bottoms of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about another way to
improve the productivity of our plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: also a great way to score a great clone
from a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I'm talking about topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping our plant can greatly improve the
performance of our plant if it is done at
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate time and at the
appropriate place in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I say appropriate time,
we can do this at just about any point in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plant is large enough,
the plants we are talking about are
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly large enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are in large veg, this is prime time
for topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to top approximately 10 to 14 days
before we enter the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we top a cannabis plant, our mission
is to remove that top node out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, that giant one that is sticking out
of the top, making it look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to make the next set of
branches become two tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will create competition within
the branches of the plant that will make
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the branches try to reach up and
become the next top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, somebody killed the king and
now all of those next soldiers are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the next king.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones in the plant will indicate
we're missing a top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody needs to take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has a trait that is called apical
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really wants one dominant top.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you remove that dominant top,
the rest of the tops know there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for them to become that main
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can top the plants at various ages
and at various stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the process of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up and talk about doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that top branch where it's too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trace it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to do it, I kind of find a
spot where I'm thinking about cutting it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I bend it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at the plant and I say,
what would the plant look like without
[SPEAKER_00]: that section?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that too much to cut off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be beneficial?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is my goal in topping right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly my goal, instead of having one
giant top, I want to create sort of a bush
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I can grow space and not have one
giant bud hitting the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead I can have a four by four
section of a bunch of buds growing into
[SPEAKER_00]: the light instead of just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: By taking out that main top, you create
that whole section into a bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see which one is going to cut out and
make the others look like a nice even
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take a little bit of trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take some confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping an OG Kush or something like that
can be a real bitch because the nodes are
[SPEAKER_00]: so far apart that you just make it look
like a Charlie Brown Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it grows out of that,
it is going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more Sativa dominant stuff,
if you top Scarlet Bagonias, if you top
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow, it makes a beautiful bush
and they go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of grab the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work your way down with your hand and just
kind of look and see what would it look
[SPEAKER_00]: like if I took this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll come to a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll take off one and you'll see two
branches that stick up evenly toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: top and the two branches underneath that
almost come right up to that top section
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have four nice new tops and you'll
say, that's what Rasta Jeff is talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make these four tops the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just cut that one out and you'll see
exactly what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to screw up a couple
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musicians have to fuck up songs to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: BMX racers have to fall on their face to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skateboarders get stitches and break bones
to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, we mess up plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt us that bad when we cut up
a plant the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got a couple more and
you're going to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of cutting that one plant from
what you learn from it is invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and just play around with
the scissors, top some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom some of them up, see what they do,
finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you have some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, that data is very strain
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, if you're topping an
OG Kush plant, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different results than if you're
topping something like a haze or a more
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa dominant, like a golden goat kind
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth structure is just naturally
different in those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're topping your plant,
do it at the intersection where it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage that plant the most expansive
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got two branches,
you've got the main stock coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a branch coming out and then
maybe an inch up, you've got a branch
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out, cut right above that top
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to leave anything hanging
off or anything extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut it right at the intersection where you
want to encourage the spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically want to take an upside down
peace sign and you want to turn it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: Y and those new tops of the Y are going to
be the new two tops of the plant and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the next two branches, hopefully they'll
catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that puts me back to why I said we
want to do this at least 10 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: before we go into flower or much sooner
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an opportunity, when we make that
cut, we've just cut out the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, we need time for
those hormones to move around into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and that helps us when we go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get much larger bud sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flower too soon after topping,
your plants just create little popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones haven't moved around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sure where the top should go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just get a bunch of little
popcorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give the plant plenty of time to
recover, plenty of time to move the
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones and plenty of time for it to
decide where the tops are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: after topping and before moving your
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that this would be a
good opportunity for a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That top you just cut off should be the
most robust, hardiest part of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make a great candidate for a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not snag that up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a big, fat, healthy clone
for the next crop while you're increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the productivity of the current crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've covered two great ways
to increase the vigor and productivity of
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured out how to properly move the
energy to the part of the plant we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can move it up to the top by taking
stuff off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spread it out by completely
eliminating the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, we have also created the
opportunity to create clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about another great
technique that I use in a personal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this in a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I implement in almost
any grow I get to play in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the pop and twist technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also know it as supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a lot of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same thing, no matter what we
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pop the stems of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of pop their knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you could hear that on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to get it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the sound I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants are a little bit thicker
than a pen or a pencil, maybe a Sharpie,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grab them right where they come
out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab the stalk kind of firmly with one
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I grab it with another hand right
above it and I twist my top hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't twist that hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to twist that dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I twist the top hand to where I break the
cellulose of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break that outer structure to where you
hear it pop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go crunch just like my knuckle did
and it'll make a little pop sound and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll feel it and you'll be freaked out
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing exactly what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will increase vigor and productivity
in a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be beneficial in a couple of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that real quick and we'll
talk more about how to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that real quick and we'll
talk more about how to do this throughout
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be short and stocky, which is way
beneficial to almost any grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are limited by height.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, in a commercial grow,
in a giant warehouse grow, most of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: still limited by height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this one tip to control the height
of our plants just a little bit can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, we're going to talk about
trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can use cracking and trellising
together, you can really control the
[SPEAKER_00]: height of your plants and you can really
maximize productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a few reasons why I like to
crack the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit more about
actually doing it now that I've given you
[SPEAKER_00]: a good reason why to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I grab the stick with one
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab the stick with another and I just
twist opposite directions and you'll hear
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go pop and crunch, then just move
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start with the main stock of the plant
and I work my way almost 90% up the way of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I can feel it's still
crunching, as long as I'm not feeling like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to rip the top off the plant
when I give it a twist, I'll work my way
[SPEAKER_00]: right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go to the bottom branch and work my
way right up the bottom branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next branch and give it a crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the microphone stand here
trying to think about the distance of
[SPEAKER_00]: cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go one and then it's only four to six
inches apart, depending on the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will crack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if it's a tiny plant, if they're
short and squat, I would go every three
[SPEAKER_00]: inches if I feel like that plant could
take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them will take it about every four
to six inches without any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little crack, move up,
give it a little crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do that to every plant in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will slow down their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make them more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can continue to do this all the way
into about week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start it early in veg, you can get
a good cracking in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them about seven, maybe 10 days to
heal up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back, give them another good crack,
throw them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get bigger, they will recover more
quickly from being busted on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and give them a good crack on
day one of flower right at the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering cycle, slow down that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stretch a little bit and then think about
it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you crack spot one and then spot two,
there's a spot in the middle of that that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can crack next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back in a week and even if they
haven't healed up from all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking, you can crack those middle spots
and make even another little knuckle,
[SPEAKER_00]: another little knurled spot on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to get in there and do
some work on them and bust them up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will recover and they will really
show progress from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I probably sound like I'm crazy
because for the past 10 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been telling you to cut stuff off of
your plants and break them and bend them
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's going to increase productivity,
but how do you get stronger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Through stress, through proper training
and that's what we're gonna do to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna tell them what we want from
them and we're gonna show them what we
[SPEAKER_00]: expect and they're gonna give it to us
with the proper guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of guidance, let's work our way
into talking about canopy control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that our plants are
apical dominant, meaning they want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately for us as growers,
it does not benefit us for the plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fill horizontal space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to spread them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several options for encouraging
our plants to spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our earlier work of topping them was a
great start, but we can go much further
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very easy, affordable and effective way
to spread out our plants a little bit is
[SPEAKER_00]: by using sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get bamboo sticks at the local
grow store for very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put about four sticks per pot
and I like to put them toward the outer
[SPEAKER_00]: edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too far in because you've got a
lot of root development there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go shoving a bamboo
stick right through a bunch of roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: so go out toward the edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the stick in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are gonna grow six feet
tall, get a six foot stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are only gonna grow three
feet tall, get a three foot stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a stick too big toward you
can't lower the light close enough to the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, so get the appropriate size stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put three or four, five or six of them in
the pot, depending on how many giant
[SPEAKER_00]: floppy branches you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can just pull those big branches
down just a little bit and attach them to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now instead of just having them going
straight up, you've kind of pulled them
[SPEAKER_00]: down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're probably one or two,
maybe three inches shorter, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how far you pull them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull them down and affix them to those
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're doing a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making the plant overall shorter
and you're also widening the plant up to
[SPEAKER_00]: let some light get into that inner part of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you don't have to clean off
as much of that crap in the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the light can penetrate in there
and you will get more production from the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these sticks will also work for
another purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those buds start to develop and get
fat and big, those sticks will support
[SPEAKER_00]: your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need something to hold up
the big buds, so now is the time to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work that into our canopy control
and also our plan for supporting our buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sticks is the easiest, most affordable
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small grow, if you've got
a home grow, sticks are probably the most
[SPEAKER_00]: economical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got several plants, a bunch of
sticks can become a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I wouldn't
even mess with sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, you may want
to start working with tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get the tomato cages on the
plants before they get too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like a tomato cage with about a
16 inch top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will cut the very bottom ring
off of the tomato cage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it upside down right where that
bottom ring is, cut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just made it a little bit shorter,
but it's also a little bit wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can customize them for your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slide the tomato cage over the plant,
spread the plant out nice and wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it spread as wide as it will go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage it to spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to pull some of the branches
out of the cage, pull it out of the cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it grows, it'll work itself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it gets real tall, put the branch
back into the cage or use those runners up
[SPEAKER_00]: the side, the side supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always affix the branches to
those side supports by using a bread tie
[SPEAKER_00]: or a twisty tie or some sort of garden
supply twist tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of options for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to be too specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use zip ties in most cases, but don't go
too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got your tomato cage on your
plant, the branches are falling out and
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining support from the outer perimeter
of the tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've worked some of the branches
up the side of that tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you pulled some of the branches down
and spread them out by using those outer
[SPEAKER_00]: rings of the tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomato cage gives us a lot of creative
options for controlling the canopy of our
[SPEAKER_00]: plant while at the same time providing
support for our tall, heavy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're using a tomato cage and you
did not top your plant, which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine, that is always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to top the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like that one big glory
bud at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for that glory bud and you
were using a tomato cage, you still may
[SPEAKER_00]: need a stick to support that giant bud if
you grow a big fat top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to make them work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a tomato cage with a stick
holding up that giant bud in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're going to put a stick in a
giant pot, I would kind of recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it toward the outer edge and then
angling it toward the center if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: support in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to ram a bamboo stake right
into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just feels rude to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it to be right in the middle
because you've got some kind of OCD or
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where you need to do it,
you can do it, but just you'll feel it
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go through those roots and it
won't feel right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two very effective methods of
controlling your canopy and also
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting the large branches and being
prepared for having large buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kind of glazed over those two
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things you're going to have to
perfect and work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be things you have to put
your hands on to learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be things that you learn when
you're doing it that will work perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: for your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not work for the next guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sticks are really easy because you can
just stick as many sticks into a pot as
[SPEAKER_00]: you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen people go completely
excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to be too crazy, but you can stick
as many sticks into a pot of soil as you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to support as many branches as you
need and you can use fuzzy sticks or bread
[SPEAKER_00]: ties or zip ties, whatever you need to
affix those branches to those sticks
[SPEAKER_00]: however you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little harder to lower the canopy
that way, but you can get big branch
[SPEAKER_00]: support that way really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomato cages, you can use the zip ties
or the twisty ties and you've got round
[SPEAKER_00]: circles to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use those to keep the plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bend the branches underneath the
rings of the tomato cage or you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: those to support the big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of options there to work
with, but you're going to have to play
[SPEAKER_00]: with it to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk you so far through it,
but it's going to be strain dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: situational dependent, but those are very
versatile tools to work with and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find some use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me quit rambling and talk about
one of my favorite methods of canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: control, which is using trellis netting,
also known as Scrog netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course Scrog, S-C-R-O-G just means
screen of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using a screen to create a nice
green canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about creating a screen of
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one most common mistake I see
people make when they are setting up their
[SPEAKER_00]: screen or their trellis netting for their
screen of green or for their canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: control is they put the netting way too
loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that stuff really tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it almost scary tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a lot of tension on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want those squares, you don't
want the net to move at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those squares to stay right in
place because that is what is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the shape of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those things move, the plant moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them tight, nice and firm like a
guitar string.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about the netting now
that I've already pointed out the number
[SPEAKER_00]: one mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we're setting up a net in a five
by five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to set them up in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already got the poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have poles or something to
affix it to, you're going to need to
[SPEAKER_00]: design some sort of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can attach it to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will get a five gallon
bucket from Lowe's or home depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will fill it up with quickcrete and
then they will stick a six foot tall PVC
[SPEAKER_00]: pole into there sticking straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a nice vertical pole that
you can work with to attach your net to
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will hold a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably get it tight enough with
that five gallon bucket filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be enough weight to be able to
pull those screens super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get yourself four buckets, fill them up
with the quickcrete, put a six foot pole
[SPEAKER_00]: in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you make a little square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can make just about any type of
length or width of shape you need to put
[SPEAKER_00]: your trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they sell it in five by five
squares, five by 10 squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go commercial grade,
you can get it in much larger segments,
[SPEAKER_00]: sections, whatever the word you want to
use right there, you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I recommend
the six foot wide commercial greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found a six foot wide roll of
plastic trellis netting that works
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully for that application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is six feet wide and it is I think 75
or 120 feet long and it is one roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just put it up on top of the
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one guy on one side, one guy on
the other and it's on a roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just walk and you zip tie one end
of it down, one end of it down and you
[SPEAKER_00]: walk the length you need to be and you zip
tie the other end, zip tie the other end
[SPEAKER_00]: and you cut it off and now the trellis net
is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you got to go back through and
tighten it by using more zip ties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's almost kind of fun once you've
got it put up that easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the long rolls are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little bit heavy, but if you've
got two big dudes, I'm six five.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Brian, he was six foot something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just grab it, lift it just above plant
height, walk right down the rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch out a long enough piece to cover
that whole row, zip tie it at the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: cut our section off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have another guy following behind us
and he would put zip ties in place to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it real tight and it would take us just a
few minutes to get each row done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to start by spreading out
your trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes folded up in that little
baggie, it is such a bitch to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like Spider-Man attacked you in
fucking one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be there for a few minutes
getting that undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the net, the longer it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smoke a dab and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke a dab because when you get all
stoned and you're trying to look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: netting, that shit doesn't work for your
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just unfold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we get it put up, we'll go take
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfold the trellis netting the best you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take you a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it put up on whatever poles you've got
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we're going to work in a five by
five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you bought a five by five
section of netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go in a square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need to use that outer square
You may need to go one or two squares into
[SPEAKER_00]: that grid to make it fit tight enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to necessarily use every
square of that netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it tight more than we want the
amount of squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that net up there tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a bunch of zip ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go excessive if you need it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that thing fairly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lower it down onto the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll watch the plants kind of bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of bend them down just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like three or four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see something that's about to
crack, of course grab it and give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is to actually lower the
height of all of the plants and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use that net to control the
height of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry because we're going to go back
and manually adjust each branch by hand
[SPEAKER_00]: and work it into this net correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we just kind of want to
lower it down and watch that canopy just
[SPEAKER_00]: become even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have instead of one giant bud here,
one long branch here, one giant bud on a
[SPEAKER_00]: long branch over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a nice even space to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to fill all that five by five net
with a bunch of small bud sites that will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually turn into more productivity than
one giant bud here, one giant bud here
[SPEAKER_00]: that are trying to touch the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fighting those from getting too hot,
getting burnt, getting crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got a bunch of buds down here
that aren't getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead we've got a nice five by five
screen of green of just beautiful even
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how to work these
branches into this net to create this
[SPEAKER_00]: desired canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working a section of plants into a trellis
net is a bit of an art and it will take
[SPEAKER_00]: some experience to perfect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it sort of like weaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to weave these plants that want to
go vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to weave them into the net to
encourage them to go horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now almost no matter what we do to these
plants other than kill them, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to grow up because earlier we spoke
of that hormone that gives them apical
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to need to stay on top of
canopy control in this trellis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to fill each square of that
trellis net with a branch that will
[SPEAKER_00]: develop into a substantial bud site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to start that process is to train
these plants to spread wide instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use this first layer of netting to
actually spread the plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we have to do as the plants grow
is they will try to pop up out of the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go in there every day and grab
those branches that tried to get away and
[SPEAKER_00]: just push them back under that next piece
of net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as they're long enough to go
underneath the next section just weave
[SPEAKER_00]: them right underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will happen is you will develop
long arms that fill up the entire space
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we flip it to flower all of those
branches will develop bud sites that will
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up each square of that trellis
netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now instead of having plants that just
grow big giant buds and grow up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and are really good for pictures we
are actually producing a large crop by
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing the entire five by five canopy
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this will take some practice to figure
out exactly what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are going to try to force
those plants down too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that taught me a lot of tips on
trellis work will tell you give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to give it some more to grow up
and win.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tips of the branches like to go up
give them a chance to win but don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: scared to get in there and bend them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something that is hard to convey
through just audio without any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: visual is you may think that to get this
branch the tip of this branch under this
[SPEAKER_00]: net that you may need to bend it at wrist
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing myself I'm comparing the
microphone stand to my wrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microphone stand is horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wrist is growing up like a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tuck this my wrist underneath
this piece of trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of grabbing at my wrist and
bending there and tucking that part under
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually go down to elbow height
to my elbow joint and pop it down there
[SPEAKER_00]: and bend it underneath the trellis at that
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a lot more room for when
that plant starts growing vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow out horizontally
because if gravity for a little while the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip will start growing up and it's going
to take it a little bit longer to grow up
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that net again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to crack it lower than you
think you need to is what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gave you enough different
explanations to try to catch on to what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying but if you think you need to
crack it here to get it underneath the net
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right here go a little lower so
you've got more bending room to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've also got more room for future
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys trellising and canopy work is an
art but when you get good at it it will
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically improve productivity and will
also make the garden much easier to work
[SPEAKER_00]: in because it's much more organized and
you don't have that one giant bud that's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow into the light which is so
photogenic and it's so beautiful to have
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also such a pain in the ass
because that's the one bud you were
[SPEAKER_00]: working your whole garden setup around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will learn how to weave your plants
into this net perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will adapt your own style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're going to the internet to
look at pictures of how to do it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a lot of great stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also see a lot of trellis nets
that were not filled sufficiently before
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants were flipped into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes more work but it is much more
rewarding than just growing that one glory
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to use the screen to
spread them out make sure you fill up that
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy before you flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also recommend a second layer of
trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would put that one depending on
the power of your light depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably put my second net
somewhere between 6 and 12 inches above
[SPEAKER_00]: that first net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the bottom net will fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll weave it all in and it will get
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to let those branches start
growing up into that second net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fill it up to where you've got
one branch coming out of each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom squares and those will grow up into
the top squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they hit the top squares you
want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a nice 6 to 12 inch section
of just rows of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rows of branches sticking straight
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost lollipop and bottom and
defoliate almost everything underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: that first net.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all gets cleaned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that larvae stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light's not going to penetrate the
canopy far enough to make that worth
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally clean all that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that bottom net is there to spread them
out and give them control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to spread the plant that would be
growing 5 feet tall straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it 3 feet tall but it's also
spread 5 by 5 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to fill in all that net
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to let it grow a little
bit vertically out of that until it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gets close to that next net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those branches that are sticking
straight up are going to turn into big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that will grow into that second net.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second net at that point is going to
work as a support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to be there to hold up all
of your giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often in a commercial environment
I've had to use a triple trellis and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes we have considered a fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all going to depend on your
genetics and what kind of lights you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we're using things like a rise
underneath Gavita lighting in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting serious growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a tent you're only going to
need the spread net and then the one net
[SPEAKER_00]: up top for support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want to use the trellis netting
and you don't want to work it into the net
[SPEAKER_00]: as far, if you just want to use it more
for a spread and not kind of create the
[SPEAKER_00]: scrog, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to work them as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just put the net on and spread
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get one stick per branch if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to overcrowd anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is just to spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want to spread them,
make them shorter than they were tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use more of that vertical
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody taught us a long time ago,
if you've got a cooler, do you just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to put one layer of beer in that cooler or
do you want to fill that whole cooler up
[SPEAKER_00]: with beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we're trying to do
with our canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just want a couple of beers
touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to make a beer tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to knock all those beers down and
put them in one nice case just like they
[SPEAKER_00]: were sold in because that's how they stack
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you can fill it the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even a beer drinker and I still
want to fit as many beers as we can in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I should recommend an article I read
a long time ago by an author named Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: Bixa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article was called Growing on the Grid
and it was exactly on this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talked about maximizing your growth
potential by utilizing the horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: space, not just the vertical space that
our plants try to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is that you
will not be able to move these plants once
[SPEAKER_00]: you put the trellis net on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do this in whatever room
these plants will be flowering in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started the example by using a 5x5 grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, we would veg in that 5x5,
put up the scrog, and then flower it in
[SPEAKER_00]: that 5x5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are vegging and flowering in a
different environment, you will have to
[SPEAKER_00]: veg them, drag them to the flowering room,
try to put that trellis up on day one,
[SPEAKER_00]: spread them out nice and wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to work them
in too much, but you can kind of bend and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate the plants a little bit without
causing any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the cracking technique I talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the branch, give it a little bit of a
twist, and bend it over just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to create a little knuckle
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also create a nice smooth bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aim it any direction you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move it over to the section of the trellis
you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be very gentle with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them several days to recover before
you go back in and crack them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty much how we're forced to do
it in a commercial environment because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't veg and flower in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have one large veg area and
multiple flowering rooms so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep perpetual cycles going.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, one of my
major goals is to harvest and refill a
[SPEAKER_00]: room in the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that doesn't sound like a big
challenge, but imagine if you've got 300
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a bunch of trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes half of the day to get it cut
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to clean the room spotless,
then try to refill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we throw the net on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we spend the rest of the day just
spreading those plants out and adjusting
[SPEAKER_00]: that net to where those plants aren't too
angry with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my long sidetrack rambly talk
on sticks, cages, and trellis netting and
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple more quick things to
cover on this list of ways to improve our
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity while in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing on my list is integrated
pest management and scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably be applying a
preventative pesticide regimen to our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use a spray
application, now is the time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use predator bugs,
now is the time to order them and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared so that we have a nice colony
before we go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing a lot of growers overlook at
this stage of the game is manually
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your best tools in finding bugs in
your grow is your own eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a little time walking through the
garden and just looking for pests or signs
[SPEAKER_00]: of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature really likes to give us hints that
there are problems in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pest that comes in gives us some
kind of a warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are on top of your game,
you've got some yellow sticky traps
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging up and you are checking those on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will give you a fair warning that
you've got bugs coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how they'll tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be bugs stuck to the yellow
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more obvious can it get?
[SPEAKER_00]: So check the yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then walk every row, every few feet,
reach into the canopy and grab a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any bugs on the underside of
the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any eggs on the underside of
the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top side of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any stippling?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any honeydew?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is thrift damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see anything that just doesn't look
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a sign of overfeeding,
underfeeding, or pH problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants and they will
tell you when something is starting to go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong and you won't need to pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scout on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for thrift damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smack the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give a couple pots a good smack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anything fly out?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you've got fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really easy to treat if you find
them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach all of your helpers to scout for
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for spider mite webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, look for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for anything that just doesn't look
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a crew leader, teach people how
to properly report the things that they
[SPEAKER_00]: see so they know when to come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, that doesn't look like a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach them what is a big deal and what is
not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always be on the lookout for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be scouting and know what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for mites and mite damage,
which is webbing, stippling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for thrift shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for thrift honeydew,
that glazy stuff on the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from your thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you tap the pots, those little black
things that fly out, those are fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shake the leaves, those little
white bugs that fly out, those are white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of what you're looking for and
constantly be looking for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy plants will be much more vigorous
and much more productive than plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are fighting off insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, scouting is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost you anything to walk
through your grow and look for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw on the Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some Joe Rogan and just stroll
through the garden and go see what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to go find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit ranting about IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I've inspired you to go look for
bugs in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what else is free that will
really improve the quality of your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: overall is note taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when something goes wrong,
you know what to blame it on and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what not to do next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on journaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to rant too much on that
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing to talk about and
then we're going to wrap up this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: because my throw is starting to burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way we can increase productivity
and vigor of our veg plants is to augment
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 levels in our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ambient CO2 level in your environment
is probably hovering somewhere between 300
[SPEAKER_00]: and 400 particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just about the standard on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my last research depends on where you
are, your elevation, what kind of city
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in, but it's somewhere between 300
and 400 particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants would prefer somewhere around a
thousand particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take up to 1200, maybe 1500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even seen people push them closer to
2000 particles per million of CO2 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants just explode with vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are several ways that you can
increase the CO2 in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I need to mention, once you
start increasing the amount of CO2 in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room environment, it is very
unhealthy for the plants to let the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: levels decline past what you have now
increased it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start boosting it to a thousand,
you either need to keep it at a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: or increase through flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is expecting this CO2 as a new
food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now feeding itself like it's got
another food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have now put your plant into another
level of high performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expecting to get that high
performance fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adjusted its diet accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut off that CO2, that extra CO2,
it will not be feeding itself properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will start seeing nutrients burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you keep up on your CO2 habit
if you start that habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you run out and the plants
start acting a little funny, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably what is causing it, is they're
still craving that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still trying to readjust their
metabolism because they're still on that
[SPEAKER_00]: high performance mode and they're not sure
what to do yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my last tip for increasing
performance and productivity and vigor of
[SPEAKER_00]: our veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared a lot of my dirty secrets,
a lot of the things that I use in my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows, a lot of things that I use
in the commercial grows.
