[SPEAKER_07]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_07]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_07]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_07]: for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting across the table for me today is
our good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I am great, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I may have fallen asleep on the couch for
a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you got here, I may have been a
little bit groggy, but I think I've got my
[SPEAKER_07]: shit together by now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Naps are good for your health.
[SPEAKER_07]: Naps are really good for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a bunch of dabs, eat a bunch of food,
and then you wake up on the couch
[SPEAKER_07]: wondering where time went, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Feeling all refreshed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're back in the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming today, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, happy to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the listeners like having you on
because we get a lot of listens when
[SPEAKER_07]: you're here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you guys, before we get too far,
I wanted to give a big thank you shout out
[SPEAKER_07]: to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: They let me play their music on my show.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't ask me for anything in return.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's super kind of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you guys support Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, Catherine Ramirez is the
most beautiful woman in reggae,
[SPEAKER_07]: so make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to the Coot or the Mystic
Roots, Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots
[SPEAKER_07]: band.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got some cool shit lined up today
to talk about, but first I want to kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: brag about my good ass weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday, I think I recorded since this
Thursday, I saw Israel Vibration,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Saturday, oh, my phone is too close to
the recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's making weird noises.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just going to throw that across the damn
room.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
Saturday.
Buy a phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, buy a phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need you for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Saturday, I went up to ComedyWorks to go
see our good friend Doug Benson again for
[SPEAKER_07]: probably the 15th or 20th-ish time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to work, full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for keeping the shop on lock
and holding everything down while Rasta
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff was up seeing Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody got to hustle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't have anybody to go with me
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I had some plans.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The person I wanted to go with me was
unable to go Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went up there and I had two tickets
and I walked up to the line and there was
[SPEAKER_07]: another dude by himself walking up to the
line, looked kind of confused,
[SPEAKER_07]: holding his printed ticket and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could tell he was a noob to ComedyWorks,
that he'd never been there and he was
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to figure out the ComedyWorks
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I watched him fumble around and I
started a conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He lit up a blunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: We smoked a blunt there in the line at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he goes, man, he asked me a
question about ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what he said
specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go, oh, no worries, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can totally do that here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we walked in, he went to get his
ticket and I go, man, you don't even need
[SPEAKER_07]: your ticket.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to sit with me tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go, you want to sit front row,
bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, no, you're shitting me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go, yeah, man, I got two front row
passes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go sit in the front row.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so anybody that knows me that listens
to the show, I'm going to brag a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have got two lifetime preferred seating
passes for ComedyWorks in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I've got to do is let them know that
I'm coming and I will be seated in seat
[SPEAKER_07]: 12, which is the front two seats right
there in front of the stage, right where
[SPEAKER_07]: the comedians are spitting and drooling
and sweating and staring you in the face
[SPEAKER_07]: and making fun of you and putting you in
part of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the B part of the show section is how I
like to think of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get made fun of every time I sit there
if I sit there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I take this brand new stranger,
a tall wookie in the front row.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge dreadlocks and a huge cheesy smile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They love me down there in the front.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll love to make fun of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I took this new dude that I'd never met
until that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was having kind of a bad day up until
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, bro, just come with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go sit front row.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he sat front row and he had the time
of his fucking life, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He laughed his ass off.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave me a hug and shit at the end of
the night.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, bro, that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my buddy Merlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're listening, bro, it was good
meeting you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So after the show, we go meet Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get stoned, hang out with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was really cool because it
was a Doug Loves Movies podcast and Harlan
[SPEAKER_07]: Williams was a fucking guest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Harlan is one of my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pete Davidson or Davison from Saturday
Night Live was another guest and Doug's
[SPEAKER_07]: friend and a comedian I've seen several
times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff Tate was the third guest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hung out and got stoned with Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't smoke pot, but he hung out with
us and Doug Benson definitely smoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got stoned with a whole bunch of cool ass
people in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I drove back to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I ate at the Mellow Mushroom and
then I was still hungry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I also ate at the Chiba Hut because I'm
a pothead and I'm a fat fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that shit was delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drove home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you're in food country,
you got to stop and get something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you drive past both of those
restaurants, you're like, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm eating here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just no stopping it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my friend Tiffany over at the
Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for a delicious meal.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You took good care of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great waitressing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Saturday, Sunday did it all over again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a beautiful date Sunday.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was able to go with me Sunday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Went up there and saw Doug Benson do
standup comedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He tore it the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He made fun of me a little bit both
nights.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two days of Doug Benson hanging out with
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second night he treated me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not even like some celebrity and
his fan hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff Tate walked up to me and asked me a
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a question for me because I was
part of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the show, they play games.
[SPEAKER_07]: They play a game called The Last Man
Stanton.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is somebody in the audience
names an actor, and then the participants
[SPEAKER_07]: in the game have to name movies that that
actor has been in until they run out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just keep going back and forth until
one of us can't do it no more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug knew that I listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's like, Rasta, Jeff will definitely
have a name for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to him for a name in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he let me give him the name.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it came time to it, I said,
I have two names in my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to give you two of them?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he picked one.
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes, no, just give me one and we'll do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the name I gave them for the game was
Philip Seymour Hoffman, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's got a lot of fucking movies and they
should know a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: They liked it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a lot of fun with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So after the show, Jeff Tate walked up and
he's like, who is your other name,
[SPEAKER_07]: bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's funny because I always forget the
guy's fucking name.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had it like in my head right at that
moment for when he asked, but I had
[SPEAKER_07]: forgotten it because I knew my time was
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go, I forgot, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, you know, and I go,
yeah, but I always forget his name.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, he played the president in
mocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: And before I could say mocking Jay,
he goes, oh, fucking Donald Sutherland,
[SPEAKER_07]: dude, and hit me on the shoulder.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that dude knows his fucking movies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff Tate knows his movies real well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They made me feel like a friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like those guys treat me like I am a homie
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I walk through comedy works,
I get high fives.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't even walk me into my seat
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, you're, you know where your
fucking seat is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go have a seat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy your night.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do comedy works is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to go there a lot in college.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love going to music shows, but some
music crowds are assholes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The crowds have evolved into assholes that
want to shove their way to the front.
[SPEAKER_07]: And spill their beer on you and just be a
disrespectful dick and don't appreciate
[SPEAKER_07]: the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they kind of ruined some concerts for
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started enjoying sitting in the back and
getting high as shit a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Concerts are getting different as I'm
getting older, but comedy shows,
[SPEAKER_07]: they don't allow any of that pushing and
shoving bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll kick you right out if you heckle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're sitting down the whole time and
you can order food and they bring it to
[SPEAKER_07]: you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So comedy shows have been kind of my new
go-to thing for a date or for some fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really great to take a girl out and
see a pretty girl smile at a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my date.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you listen to the show,
but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a great time with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another local comedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do support local comedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the Wild Cousins comedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to all the Pueblo comedy crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been talking about everything but
cannabis on this podcast for the past 10
[SPEAKER_07]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for some weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, let's not talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's fucking smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to take a dab with me,
bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gorilla glue or Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now let's take a quick second here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you realize what I just asked you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people in places that are
probably just smacking their SMDH.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smack my damn head right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's shake my damn head,
but I always, I thought of it as smack my
[SPEAKER_07]: damn head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, smack myself in the foot.
I like that better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I thought of it when I first
saw it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's somebody just went,
this motherfucker has got Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies and gorilla glue just sitting
there ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not even flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the most beautiful hash you've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're kind of spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote yes for legalization while we're on
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you do, make sure that you
include some sort of law or paragraph in
[SPEAKER_07]: there that allows you to have some sort of
consumption place where everybody can
[SPEAKER_07]: gather and smoke cannabis, because that's
what we missed here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now we're struggling to get
those types of rules in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like some wonderfulness?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like, yes, dude, enlighten me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before you do, let's make a decision
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like the Girl Scout cookies or
would you like the gorilla glue?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to go with the gorilla glue
only because right before we started
[SPEAKER_06]: recording, we did sample the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was quite wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I coughed for quite a bit,
so I'm hoping the gorilla glue will be
[SPEAKER_06]: slightly less chokey for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give you a little dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike takes a little tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: No shame, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the dab you want, not the dab that
everybody else is taking.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, yeah, you don't have to dab like
I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a dab that's comfortable for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike just said that he had some news to
share.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make Mike share his news
before he takes this dab, because like we
[SPEAKER_07]: just talked about, he's going to cough for
30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this dab will be your reward for
a quick...
[SPEAKER_07]: Cough just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this dab is your reward that is
waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to dab while you tell us
about your news.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got a text a few days ago from a
local friend of mine in the industry down
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always been kind of a step removed,
like he's not an owner of a dispenser or
[SPEAKER_06]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he got me a text saying he had a
licensing hearing he wanted me to attend.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he received his special use permit to
open a cannabis museum slash consumption
[SPEAKER_06]: location here in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this somebody that I know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the person I think I know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about specifics off the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out Greener Side Empire Castoffs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I totally know who you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, shout out old school Greener Side
Empire.
[SPEAKER_07]: What up, Hanky B?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you're doing well, homie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Hanky.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, but when you say Greener Side
Empire, that is the king of the Greener
[SPEAKER_07]: Side Empire.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of his buddies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What up, shorter dude with curly hair?
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be your bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So look for that coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a cannabis museum?
[SPEAKER_06]: During the licensing hearing, his
description of it would be a marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: themed Hard Rock Cafe would be the closest
business that he could relate it to that
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone's familiar with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you sit down at your booth with
the marijuana product you bring yourself,
[SPEAKER_06]: there will be stuff on the wall that's
like marijuana was originally outlawed and
[SPEAKER_06]: da-da-da-da-da-da.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like historical stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've hired local historians,
like professional historians that do this
[SPEAKER_06]: for a living and are currently researching
cannabis because there isn't a local
[SPEAKER_06]: historian who expert... Word lost in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who focuses?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, specializes in cannabis history here
in Provo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose I could have qualified,
but I didn't know that was a job I could
have had.
[SPEAKER_07]: Us, bro, us.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to come to somebody... All of
the schooling will be great and useful,
[SPEAKER_07]: but then they need to come to somebody
involved in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they've got a couple of people
like us on the team.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't, I'm going to be that
person on the team for them, if at all
[SPEAKER_06]: possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dab Rock Cafe, if you will.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's got a name, but I don't
honestly remember it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that should be coming here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Earliest estimates, first of the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Knowing how these things go, sometimes I'm
going to say by end of spring,
[SPEAKER_06]: we should have a place to go and enjoy
some cannabis out in the public.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: In a business that's private members only.
[SPEAKER_07]: Will that be in the city of Pueblo or in
the county of Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just into the county.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just into the county.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys want that damn tax money,
but you won't let us have anything in the
[SPEAKER_07]: city.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pueblo county passed rules and regs
for public consumption shops a while ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only been one other applicant that
I know of to try and they fucked it up so
[SPEAKER_06]: hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was painful to watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I remember hearing about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really pissed that they did it
because that set everybody back.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like six months.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our buddy Mike reported on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike is our correspondent now suddenly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reporter Mike live from the field.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, you win a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: You win a free dab for such a wonderful
report on the show here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a cannabis museum in the
county of Pueblo here before too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike said something about public
consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to humble myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to eat a little bit of crow,
if you will, on this show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never said eat crow before.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the phrase.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I've said it, I understand where
it comes in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never said that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard it and thought that's a weird
phrase, but it just came in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to the phrase, eat some crow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got its place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you grubbing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, recently I've had beef with a couple
of people, personal issues, childish
[SPEAKER_07]: bullshit that's stuck in my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they recently threw a harvest festival
here in Pueblo, Colorado, and their event
[SPEAKER_07]: was completely fucking successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: They crushed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a public consumption event three
blocks from my house on the main street of
[SPEAKER_07]: our town.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our town is called Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: This shit happened on Pueblo Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smoked hash and weed and had a
miniature cannabis cup basically in their
[SPEAKER_07]: parking lot, four minutes from my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not attend it because like I said,
I was seeing Doug Benson and that was my
[SPEAKER_07]: priority.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was working, but a number of people that
I know were there, they said it went off
[SPEAKER_06]: huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spence and Jesse cleaned house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spence won six awards and Jesse won first
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse's Outdoor Grape OG beat,
I don't know if I'm supposed to say that
[SPEAKER_07]: that shit was outdoor, but Jesse's
possibly Outdoor Grape OG- Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: ... beat a bunch of indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to Jesse for his victory.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Spence for six fucking
awards, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Home runs, boys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had personal issues with those people
and it's my choice over possibly business
[SPEAKER_07]: issues that were legal involving a store.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even though we've gotten a little bit
of beef, we don't get along.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't see eye to eye on fucking
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all in the same community.
[SPEAKER_07]: They pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give them a shout out right
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Terry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to fucking Ryan.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Big old fucking plate of crow right here
at the fucking Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_07]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fucking feasting on it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying it out loud.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: No sarcasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm a smart ass and I'm fucking,
I'm straight faced right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear that turnout was way bigger than
they were expecting and that they've had a
[SPEAKER_06]: previous events.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go to the next event that
they throw.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've never gone to one of their
events for personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nor have I.
[SPEAKER_07]: Personal stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a stubborn asshole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something in me, if I don't like you for
something you've done in the past,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm probably not going to like you in the
future.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I see them trying to make progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried to work with those people
before and we just butt heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've kind of separated myself,
but I'm going to get over it and I'm going
[SPEAKER_07]: to go to their next event because they
crushed it this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to man up there for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel better.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, you look perplexed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got a weird look on your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just, I wished I would have gone to
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when I heard how well it went,
I was bummed that I had to work all
[SPEAKER_06]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of wish that I would have gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's fully the first time I felt
about one of their events and they finally
[SPEAKER_06]: did it right from what I hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard about any blowback from it
either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing wrong went on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It went smoothly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's been several days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Wednesday now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about to be Thursday.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nothing's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not in the Saturday morning paper,
then okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunday paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was going to say, I was going to try
not to miss any Doug Benson shows at
[SPEAKER_07]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to get as many as I can
because if you tweet Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_07]: he will read your tweets during the first
20 minutes of his show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he does.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just reads tweets and makes fun of
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just tweeted at him, Hey Doug,
front row again, feels like home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he read a bunch of tweets and he
goes, this guy back here says,
[SPEAKER_07]: where's whatever my Twitter name?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, his tweet says, I'm way too
high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, speaking of way too high,
Rasta Jeff's in the front row again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people fucking cheered, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: They clapped and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, Rasta Jeff's been in the
front row in that seat for the last 18
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug Benson shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: He hasn't missed a show yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try not to miss any,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the listeners out there want this
experience, the way to do it is to make
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing weed to every Doug Benson show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the slot in Denver is taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your ass lives in Cincinnati,
there's a way to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go bananas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the club in Cincinnati,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost want to Google at you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take fucking 30 seconds to
Google.
[SPEAKER_07]: We might pause it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We might not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have Siri do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a Doug fan for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to start scheduling some of these
off work.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just asked Siri, where's the club?
[SPEAKER_07]: Go bananas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Live stand up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since a fucking Natty, bro, I'm such a
comedy geek.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go bananas.
[SPEAKER_07]: You listen to a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comedy is one of my favorite fucking
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we've been rambling on for like 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get on to a topic here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a couple of things in the news
that we could talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I read an article.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to read you the article
because it's forever long.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way too many words long.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I found this article on a website
called The Guardian.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike also read it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be able to discuss it without
reading it here on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be able to paraphrase a little
bit for you guys and tell you what it's
[SPEAKER_07]: about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, they're talking about an
influx of people coming from across the
[SPEAKER_07]: country to Pueblo, Colorado, because
Pueblo, Colorado, for the size of the city
[SPEAKER_07]: that we are and for our economic
development and the amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: jobs available, we are the most affordable
place to land when you come from out of
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you agree with that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're routinely ranked as like the
cheapest city in Colorado for our size.
[SPEAKER_06]: For our size.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you went to anywhere smaller,
you're pretty much fucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the next smaller town there's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you have to have a shitload of money
to live in nowhere land.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, there's, there's a hundred
thousand people here, which is just about
[SPEAKER_07]: perfect for coming to a city that's not
too expensive, trying to get a new start.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not too big.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ranked as one of the cheapest cities
in the U S recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, yeah, we're going to bring
that up later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver can spit some people out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver can chew you up and spit you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a lot of, there's a lot of
stuff, a lot of reasons people are moving
[SPEAKER_06]: to Pueblo right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legal marijuana is definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's dive into the story cause I'm
about to talk about a bunch of shit we
[SPEAKER_06]: should talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get you fired up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get you, it's like I'm pulling
the fucking cord on the chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been a part of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a part of this story in like a
backroom sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met with all the players about this
topic, but don't spill too many of those
[SPEAKER_07]: beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't read, read away.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to read it, but we'll talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're saying that all of these people
moving to Pueblo, Colorado are beginning
[SPEAKER_07]: to put a burden on our resources here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a resource called Posada,
which is a nonprofit organization that
[SPEAKER_07]: helps families get their sub themselves on
their feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: If something happens to somebody here in
Pueblo, they can go to Posada.
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, there's a guy in this news
article that hurt his foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something fell on him and broke his foot
and he can't work for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's going to Posada to get a little
bit of help.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they're giving him,
possibly some food, probably some cheese,
[SPEAKER_07]: just to keep him on his feet while he's
unable to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're saying that those resources at
Posada are being strained and the people
[SPEAKER_07]: are coming from all over the nation to
come work here and they're not prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, you look like you got something on
your mind already.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're stewing, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what they're getting at is that legal
marijuana is creating a huge homeless
[SPEAKER_06]: problem in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not like causing good,
hardworking Americans who got hooked on
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana to become homeless.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's attracting homeless people in other
areas to Pueblo, apparently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the article goes on to cite people
that work at Posada and a couple other
[SPEAKER_06]: agencies in town saying that they've had
huge increases in people seeking services
[SPEAKER_06]: from them, whether it's housing vouchers
or food stamps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or medicine vouchers or help with medical
problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Posada especially has been pretty vocal
with the press down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's spiraled nationally when the
anti-pot groups picked it up and started
[SPEAKER_06]: pushing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other newspapers started picking it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the problems caused by amendment 64
is more homeless people coming to Colorado
[SPEAKER_06]: because of our marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just that idea never really made sense
to me until I realized that it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal to be homeless most places,
but it is illegal to have pop most places.
[SPEAKER_06]: And homeless people have huge rates of
substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're homeless, consuming
substances is a way to deal with some of
[SPEAKER_06]: the miserable conditions in that
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can move to a place where
they're not going to chase you around and
[SPEAKER_06]: throw you in jail for having some weed,
why not be there?
[SPEAKER_06]: And when that's combined with a number of
other things that are happening at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time, like legal marijuana here,
everybody's talking about how many
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of people are working in the
industry and how much money it's making.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's talking about what it takes to
get an MED badge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something I was going to touch
on in a few minutes here.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're homeless and there's a new
booming industry, I mean, humans have been
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it since humans started doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: We move to where there's work,
especially when there's no work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just coming out of a depression,
like a national depression where work's
[SPEAKER_06]: hard to come by everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially in our age demographic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember all those articles about
people in their thirties that moved home
[SPEAKER_06]: after college?
[SPEAKER_06]: A fuckload of them working legal weed now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all got degrees, I'm not saying me,
but a lot of them got degrees on internet
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those jobs are all taken up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit kind of failed, or not failed,
but I mean, it's just gotten so much
[SPEAKER_07]: easier to make a webpage that that guy
that used to know how to do it isn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a theory that that's going to
happen to the weed grower too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do a whole report on that
here on the podcast in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, those people are now in the weed
industry making a good living.
[SPEAKER_06]: Making a pretty solid living, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of reasons homeless
people are, or people on the brink of
[SPEAKER_06]: being homeless or moving to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, I've said it countless times,
like, if you want to come here,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's great, but come prepared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, what I wrote here, come prepared is
one of the, seriously, that's written on
[SPEAKER_07]: this fucking paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come prepared.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people didn't, like when
you're kind of at the end of your road
[SPEAKER_06]: financially and opportunity wise,
wherever you live and you hear about,
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado and everything that's going on
here, all the stores, all it grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you figure at least I can get a
job trimming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can sit in a room and cut leaves off
buds all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can surely do it in scrubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'll move there and do it,
but no one knows what that takes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, if you're going to come
prepared, that's definitely the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come here with a little bit of money,
because it's going to take a minute to get
[SPEAKER_07]: a job in the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to get, before you even come
here, research a Colorado marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcement division support badge.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're coming here for work in the
industry, definitely know what it takes to
[SPEAKER_06]: get a job in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're not going to get a job trimming
for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may get a job trimming for your cousin
or whatever, but that shit's not going to
[SPEAKER_07]: last long.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not going to sustain you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may sound fruitful right now,
but trimming for your buddy or trimming
[SPEAKER_07]: for whoever's got this grow option for
you, it's not going to work unless it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: legal...
[SPEAKER_06]: Like unless they own a business,
there's a lot of people that have lived
[SPEAKER_06]: here or have recently moved here with kind
of a plan and gotten a job that are
[SPEAKER_06]: growing their legal six plants and they
need help trimming and they'll call you
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can trim for them for like 10
hours once every 90 days.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's unreliable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to work for like five of those
people if you want to try to pay rent that
[SPEAKER_06]: way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're not going to find four others
right when you move here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it that the trimmers I use go trim
for other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, it's expected, but I hate that
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it that it's like them seeing under
my skirt or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't go tell everybody else what
was under there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, if you're not trimming,
if you don't need a med badge,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's probably not a job that's going to
last for very long right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're cleaning up illegal grow
operations.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting rid of all of that shit
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When things are legal, the illegal stands
out like a sore thumb.
[SPEAKER_06]: True.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something we've talked about on the
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: So research getting your marijuana
enforcement division support badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got any drug felonies in the
last 10 years, don't even think about
[SPEAKER_07]: coming to Colorado to get a job in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to give you a badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't have the badge, you can't
walk in the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't let you behind the counter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't deliver.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't sweep the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I swear to God, get on the website.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes two seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Google Colorado, MED badge, and it'll come
right up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our security guards are badged with their
security service, like trained with their
[SPEAKER_07]: security.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wear their security guard badge and
their shirts for their security and their
[SPEAKER_07]: gun all day long.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're also wearing a marijuana
enforcement division badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to have that shit to work there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had to go spend an extra... It's
like 150 bucks for that badge just to work
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys, if you can't afford $150
badge, and if you can't qualify for that
[SPEAKER_07]: badge, don't come here, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm not talking shit to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying don't come here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to be stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to be able to get in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be relying on resources
here, and you're going to make it... It
[SPEAKER_07]: just kind of makes it look shitty.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can come here and do something,
you're invited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're able, if you're willing,
if you're ready, if you can trim,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're able to get the badge,
we'll take you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I'm going to sound like an
asshole here.
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're on it, the big four
requirements are no drug felonies in 10
[SPEAKER_06]: years, no felonies period in five.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fucked up that you could have
killed someone with your car or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, five years ago, and get your badge
before the guy who got busted with an
[SPEAKER_06]: out...
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two grams of concentrate in most places.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucked up world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so no drug felonies in 10 years,
no felonies in five, and your student
[SPEAKER_06]: loans and your child's support need to be
in order.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what in order means is you have to
call them and set up a payment plan and
[SPEAKER_06]: make one payment.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're already paying on it,
you're legit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't even say anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're already paying on it and
everything's in good order, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you've been ducking child support
for student loans for a while,
[SPEAKER_06]: you got to stand up, call Sallie Mae,
and start making payments.
[SPEAKER_07]: All they want is a receipt and proof that
you're paying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go show them that my student
loans were in good order.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I had to do is get a thing from both
loan companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I filled out... I printed the application
online.
[SPEAKER_07]: I printed it at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: I filled it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me like 30 minutes to do it,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like a thick job application.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really thorough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then they give it to the FBI who
checks it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't just lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while they're checking it,
they're smart as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: They take your paperwork and start running
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they call you back while it's being
ran, and they fingerprint you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they take their sweet fucking time
fingerprinting you so that if there is
[SPEAKER_07]: anything wrong with your paperwork,
if you're illegal, if you've got warrants,
[SPEAKER_07]: they'll come and get you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your ass right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wondered why it took so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seemed like the tech was brand new,
and yet it took her 74 tries to get my
[SPEAKER_06]: index finger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that fingerprinting thing,
that laser reading fingerprinter is hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't like me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like this is on purpose after
like six tries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've actually come and arrested people
who've had warrants while they were there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one thing I was going to say,
and this is going to sound like really
[SPEAKER_06]: rude as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and take cash when you go to the
license place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, they do not take a check or a
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 150.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to quote the prices
right now because they change all the
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I paid 150 for mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a big echo?
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got these headphones on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought I heard echo.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as we're not echoing in the
recording.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I know it sounds great to pack
up your whole life and come to Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: and enjoy the dispensary and smoke some
legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But have a plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as complicated as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to use Adam as an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're a deep sea fisherman,
we've got your fucking job here too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam thought he was going to come here and
grow some paw and be the king shit of the
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not talking to shit about Adam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam is making it, but Adam is not buying
whatever CD came out last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam is not going with us to dinner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work construction with him all winter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: See?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not trying to Adam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not talking shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: He showed up, realized that that wasn't
going to be how it was going to play out
[SPEAKER_06]: and immediately got to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He thought he was going to come here and
grow and survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you fight for it, you can make it,
but come here with a plan, save up some
[SPEAKER_06]: money, find a job, find a place or two
that you want to see to rent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like have a plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or don't just show up here with a U-Haul
truck and $300 in your pocket because you
[SPEAKER_06]: will be homeless in like four days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or my option for you, which I recommend,
which you're going to think I'm a dick,
[SPEAKER_07]: but save the energy that you were going to
use to move here and use that energy to
[SPEAKER_07]: fight for legalization where you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just push that over.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do that right where you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just gather a bunch of people,
get a bunch of like-minded folk.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be cool if you can get all the
smokers around, but I understand a bunch
[SPEAKER_07]: of potheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you don't want the potheads to
go to city council with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of guys you just want to
leave them behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've definitely had more than one walk up
and shoot themselves and everybody else in
[SPEAKER_06]: the foot and it sucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those guys you can just leave them
behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: But try to get an intelligent group of
people, put an ad on Craigslist in your
[SPEAKER_07]: area, say, Hey, I want to fight to
legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start a legalization group and you
guys get together and you make a petition
[SPEAKER_07]: and you make a petition and you try to get
it put on the ballot for your community
[SPEAKER_07]: that, Hey, we want to make a medical
marijuana legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easier than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's already three groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening to this in the U.S.,
there's already three groups in your
[SPEAKER_06]: state, town, and city working on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to find them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normal, find normal, the national
organizations for the reform of marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: laws, the project policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The marijuana policy project.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I think I know who I'm reaching for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just fucking, I have that ADD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then who's our third friend?
[SPEAKER_07]: You said there's three of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said there are three of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wasn't thinking of three
specifically, but there are three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Responsible Ohio and there's fucking one
in Maine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just Google Cannibal, Cannibal
Cannibal.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, don't Google Cannibal.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least a dozen states are voting on
marijuana legalization this year or next
[SPEAKER_07]: year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis advocacy groups for your area is
what you want to find.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then join that shit and then do what
you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's got their own gift in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to fight for legalization,
you have to find where you fit in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find what you can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: My niche is this podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: My niche is making seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: My niche is growing like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: My niche is taking care of my patients and
paying attention to what works for them
[SPEAKER_07]: medicinally and adjusting my growth
schedule and my grown nutrients and my
[SPEAKER_07]: growth strains to work for my individual
patient's medical needs, which is an art
[SPEAKER_07]: to tell you the fucking truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: To grow enough weed for Mike and enough
weed for Doug and the other people that I
[SPEAKER_07]: supply and have the right strains at the
right times for these people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes a little bit of scheduling and a
little bit of foresight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a construction worker and you're
looking to move here and do construction
[SPEAKER_06]: and smoke weed in the evenings,
have as much of a fucking plan about what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to do in life as Jeff just
laid out right there is like what he does
[SPEAKER_06]: is his niche.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like at least that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be getting online and like,
oh, you know, I'm a car salesman.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find a dozen car dealerships looking for
employees before you even consider moving
[SPEAKER_06]: out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Call them, contact them, send them your
information, let them know you'll be here
[SPEAKER_06]: whenever looking for a job long before you
move out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that moved out here with just a
hope and a prayer, most of them have had
[SPEAKER_06]: to beg people for money so that they can
haul their ass back home.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has to suck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, Colorado has become the not
what you know, but who you know state.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to be in the cannabis industry
right now, there's just so many rules and
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations and the tiniest fuck up can
cost the shop 10,000 to a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: bucks that you can lose their licensing
because you did something that half the
[SPEAKER_06]: people that walk in our doors every day
assume we're doing constantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So gaining that level of trust in a job
interview is a motherfucker.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if your main sales pitch is that
you've been high as shit for a decade,
[SPEAKER_06]: like just don't try, like come here and do
whatever you've been doing to make a
[SPEAKER_06]: living.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's selling weed, don't move here
because we got stores that do that now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to look at a lot of job applications
because anything that goes for the grow
[SPEAKER_07]: department, the job applications get
passed to myself and another guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would not believe some of the verbiage
that I see in job applications.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like list your skills.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog, I could grow the sticky icky fire
dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got hydro skills with the Z and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, we honestly, we throw those
applications away, bring a resume,
[SPEAKER_07]: look professional.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the weed industry, but it is called
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to better our business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make money so we can improve
our business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can open more stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just how business fucking works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't come trying to talk like you're a
cool gangster and try to impress us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be professional.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legal comes with rules, regulations and
expectations.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be wearing a lab coat.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you work next to me in the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that sounds ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were lab coats, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a different lab coat for each
room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to know that you're responsible
enough to wear this lab coat in room A and
[SPEAKER_07]: know that you need to take that son of a
bitch off and put on another lab coat
[SPEAKER_07]: before you enter room B.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be aware enough to actually
care about cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to know that you can read the
warning signs when we use a pesticide and
[SPEAKER_07]: we put up a certain do not enter sign or
whatever gear is required to enter this
[SPEAKER_07]: room.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to know that you can read that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the salespeople, if I make a real
simple mistake, I can get the shop shut
[SPEAKER_06]: down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody, anybody that works there pretty
much with the badge, if we do the right,
[SPEAKER_07]: if we say the wrong shit, the store can be
closed in any minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're under camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, you guys think we can hang out
and smoke pot and be chill?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm busy as fuck all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no chairs where I work.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no chairs in my work area.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always standing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also we're under camera from every
angle.
[SPEAKER_07]: At all times you're on two cameras.
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter where you are in that building,
there are two cameras covering that area.
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot scratch my ass in that building
without being seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do something really funny,
you can go to the office and ask for the
[SPEAKER_07]: footage like immediately because it's
available.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had security that was three rooms
away, make fun of me for butt crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cameras are good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is on camera to the point where
they can read drivers licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: They read the VIN number on my car outside
in the parking lot with the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how fucking smooth those cameras
were.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were reading VIN numbers on cars.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people really don't understand the
level of regulation and scrutiny that the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry's under.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those cameras go about a hundred feet all
the way around the perimeter of the
[SPEAKER_07]: building, all the way like a hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: They go all the way to the street and
shit.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why when you hear about a
dispenser, you're getting robbed in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear about the arrest of the guy who
did it like an hour and a half later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's funny because if somebody smokes
anywhere near the building, our security
[SPEAKER_07]: guards damn near run outside with their
gun in their hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot smoke on our premises,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody can smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: The gun stays in the holster, but yeah,
you can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: He really wants to take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you cannot smoke anything anywhere
near our dispensary, you guys,
[SPEAKER_07]: we can't have, I've mentioned this before,
excuse my burping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a medical marijuana patient and I
cannot have any of my medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: products in my private vehicle on my work
shift in my car parked in the parking lot
[SPEAKER_07]: at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to wait till I get home.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to drive home and dab hard after
work because I can't have the shit there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that might be seen as on-site
consumption could cost the shop its
[SPEAKER_06]: license.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't carry our beverages.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a guy that works in the back,
I can take my bottle, my Dr. Pepper after
[SPEAKER_07]: lunch, I can take that back to the back of
the building, but they will not let me
[SPEAKER_07]: take my drink into the bud room when I go
visit Mike, when I'm chatting him up,
[SPEAKER_07]: when I'm taking a pee break.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike and I hardly ever see each other at
work, but when we do, it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: hey buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: No open containers in the bud room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say you were a customer and you spilled
that shit in a jar of weed, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: even charge you for what you just ruined
because I can legally only sell you a
[SPEAKER_06]: quarter of an ounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: An ounce or an ounce depending on where
your license says you're from.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's shitty.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're from Texas and you spill your
water into a jar of weed that's got eight
[SPEAKER_06]: ounces of weed in it, this shop's got to
eat a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight ounces worth.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my jab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you take your water bottle back there
or anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Only if it's got a lid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a water bottle with a lid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then keep it well the fuck away from the
bud counter.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I was asking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure I've seen a couple of
water bottles back by that window well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: The window ledge is where they go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where they're safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The window ledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's strict, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm getting at is there is no hanging
out, smoking pot, being lazy, having fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only time I get to groove and have a
good time is when I'm pushing a broom or a
[SPEAKER_07]: mop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will catch myself shaking my ass because
we play loud music in the back and there's
[SPEAKER_07]: good music up front most of the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's good music going on as one of the
best parts, but the only time you get to
[SPEAKER_07]: chill out and have fun is on lunch breaks
or sometimes we have little team meetings
[SPEAKER_07]: and shit which are fun, but it's hard work
working in a dispensary you guys work.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're coming here to work in the
industry, be ready to put in work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put in work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, if you know who you are- All
day, every day, it never stops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I go in nine-ish?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just depends on the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some more between eight and 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just depends on honestly how busy we're
going to be, what I've got to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what I've got to do today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how much time it's going to take,
but sometimes we don't leave there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've left at seven o'clock before.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone in at nine in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone in at eight and left at seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've worked several 12-hour days there
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys up front have to work longer
shifts because you can't close up there
[SPEAKER_07]: until the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the back, we can pretty much work,
but we just got to finish the job.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of shit to do in the back
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just what happens in the legal
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's work to be done and it's got to
get done by somebody and pot takes a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of planning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of planning for us in the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: People come here with just the craziest
expectations and it's fucked a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're one of those guys that quits a
job all the time, if you're one of those
[SPEAKER_07]: guys that can't show up on time,
if you're one of the guys that makes
[SPEAKER_07]: excuses, you're not going to make it in
the marijuana industry in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a Lacerato shirt come
dinnertime, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to look professional.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to take care of yourself here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, this may sound like shit,
but this is the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: For every one dude that is hireable,
there are seven women that are hireable
[SPEAKER_07]: that are way more attractive than you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a dude and you're trying to get
a job in the industry, you got to get your
[SPEAKER_07]: shit together because- You put a real
resume together, Donald.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful women sell more weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's already an uphill battle for a lot
of you dudes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: Resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been going for 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so baked.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the longest news article
summation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even read the news articles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've gone so many different places with
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to get slightly back on topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that pisses me off the most
about this whole legal pot causes an
[SPEAKER_06]: increase in homelessness nonsense is one
of the big reasons Pueblo is experiencing
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot more homeless people right now
looking for services or people on the
[SPEAKER_06]: brink of being homeless looking for
services is because all of the cities
[SPEAKER_06]: around us currently bust homeless people
out of their area.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only way they've got to deal
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If Posada could have anything they wanted
right now, it would be millions more
[SPEAKER_06]: funding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that they could send everybody back
home.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a small reason for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you send everybody home,
hopefully they've got family, friends,
[SPEAKER_06]: people in the community that they know and
can make contact with to help them get
[SPEAKER_06]: back on their feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like somewhere where they're tied to the
community a little bit rather than here
[SPEAKER_06]: where they're strangers to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most places are just like,
Hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear this place up the way that you
probably can't get back to without a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of help is banging.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a bus ticket there for free,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got like everything you need.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a guy ask me for a ride that one day
and I probably would have told him no,
[SPEAKER_06]: except the place he was asking to go was
like a block and a half from where I was
[SPEAKER_06]: headed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took a look at him and he looked
totally fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like recently, like his clothes were
clean, but he looked like he had the worst
[SPEAKER_06]: day after the worst month ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, all right, dude,
I can give you a ride.
[SPEAKER_06]: To where I'm already going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got like 150 pounds on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you pull like a real fucking
loaded weapon on me, I've got this,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially in a car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I can reach you, I win.
[SPEAKER_06]: And his little story just wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he had a serious medical condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in Albuquerque and they were like,
dude, didn't you hear Pueblo's got it for
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got like free services for you
with your shit and they'll take real good
[SPEAKER_06]: care of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the community is going to love you and
they'll get you a house and a job and
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking get you on your feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is Pueblo they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't got fuck off for anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're looking to invest a couple
of million dollars in a new marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Pueblo don't got what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheap to live.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the highest unemployment in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the Colorado unemployment rates
like four point something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the lower than lowest in the
nation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Pueblo's unemployment rate is like
five and a half or six, like a good point
[SPEAKER_06]: and a half higher than the rest of the
state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you magnify that times the amount
of people that are in the state,
[SPEAKER_06]: like it's a huge, huge chunk of the jobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's a lot of people that came
here looking for work that are just
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking shit out of luck now because they
came with no plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're trying to pin it all on legal
pot when there's like 30 different
[SPEAKER_06]: reasons, homeless people and people about
to be homeless.
[SPEAKER_06]: We added to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't rank us the cheapest,
like the third cheapest city in the U S
[SPEAKER_06]: and expect that shit not to have
consequences, which is in every newspaper
[SPEAKER_06]: in the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not plan poorly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: This dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'm going to hit the dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hitting the fucking hit man,
the Samson hit man combo collab rig with a
[SPEAKER_07]: highly educated DNA on it that runs to the
G nail from emo tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to giddy up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Dougie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like shout out to task.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep going, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep going while I dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me more about Posada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Posada is, I don't have anything
against Posada, except they're being nuts
[SPEAKER_06]: on this issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting national press talking
about how it's all marijuana's fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you read the article,
you'll get about three quarters of the way
[SPEAKER_06]: through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they mentioned like other cities,
bus and homeless people here in straight
[SPEAKER_06]: line to them when they're putting them on
the bus town and Pueblo is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a Pueblo being ranked the cheapest
city in the U S tons of people moving
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That three or four of them are going to
get jobs in the marijuana industry only to
[SPEAKER_06]: find out that we don't take felons.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, multiple, multiple, they,
they just don't publicize any of the
[SPEAKER_06]: requirements anywhere outside of this
podcast, basically.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's your public service
announcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys make sure you Google that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you can find out if you're even
qualified to work in our industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're going, if you're coming here
to run an illegal industry, I'm not even
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to be a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was deep shit into the illegal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can admit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to get away from it because it
wasn't going to work much longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to go downhill trying to stay
on that side of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I've got a steady job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is legit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's much easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the, the illegal industry is going
away.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see it crumbling here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those people that are too stubborn,
too to come to the light.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see them struggling and dwindling
and falling off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a couple of years ago, the people I
knew that were living right on the edge
[SPEAKER_06]: between the black and the white market,
like the, what you'd call the gray market.
[SPEAKER_06]: The more stores that opened up,
the harder it was to compete with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the guy that had one strain for
you in March, come July would show up a
[SPEAKER_06]: seven by December.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a selection of hash in his bag
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by January, it was just too much of a
fucking hassle, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_06]: selection, because you could just go to a
store and pick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you never had to hang out and not
seem like foot traffic or any of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Meet somebody somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much, how many episodes of How It's
Made would never have been watched if we
[SPEAKER_06]: could just buy weed in stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadliest catch would have never been
viewed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Viewership on a lot of shit would go way
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't have to hang out with your
weed dealer, for two hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you didn't seem like you were there
buying weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: This dude's just really, really bored.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of his friends come to visit for
two hours at a chunk, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just play Xbox all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just so much more convenient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when you get to the shop and you're
like, really, that's the price.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you start wondering how much your
time's worth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how many hours that I spent sitting
on the couch listening to bullshit because
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there to buy a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the best weed in town.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause every weed dealer wants to show you
his new thing that he bought with your
[SPEAKER_07]: money that you spent there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, I'm not into ukuleles,
but all right, I'll see your new one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at my new didgeridoo, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything but more fucking deadliest catch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to this song, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I'm kicking that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why I used to get stoned and
watch the fuck out of some deadliest
[SPEAKER_07]: catch.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's fun wondering which one's going
to get squashed by a crab cage next.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to write myself a note here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not show related.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch more deadliest catch.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I record another podcast and I have a
deadliest catch story that I want to tell
[SPEAKER_07]: on that podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an episode where Jeff sent it
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to tell this weird ass dream
story on this podcast?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this show is almost a fucking hour
long here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've teased all these people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: One time I got my wisdom teeth removed and
they gave me Vicodin and I took too many
[SPEAKER_07]: of them and I fell asleep watching
deadliest catch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like the main setup here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I woke up in a dream that I had caught
somebody trying to kill people on the
[SPEAKER_07]: deadliest catch boat and I murdered him
because he was trying to kill me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in self defense, I killed the
motherfucker because he killed everybody
[SPEAKER_07]: else on the boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I realized everybody on the boat
is dead but me and they're going to think
[SPEAKER_07]: I did this shit and I'm all covered in
blood and the boat's all covered in blood.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to get the fuck out of here and
then I wake up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since I took too many Vicodin before I
fell asleep, when I woke up, I didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: really wake up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was still dreaming, but I was physically
sitting up in real life.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in dream life, I was still in my boat
and I saw blood all over my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it took me a good, I don't really
know, but I'm going to say like three or
[SPEAKER_07]: four minutes of like shaking my head
around and walking around my bedroom
[SPEAKER_07]: going, why is there blood everywhere?
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck is happening?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally the blood faded away and
I woke up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do too many Vicodin, kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my fucking theory.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had my wisdom teeth taken out and
they fucking hurt, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of listening, but while I was
listening, I had a thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear your thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been rambly as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're still listening, I'll go
ahead and pay to send you a sticker pack
[SPEAKER_06]: or some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you tweet me, I like it when you
ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then tag fucking grow from your heart
podcasting it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a whole bunch of people still
listening and I get a shit load of tweets
[SPEAKER_06]: about it, we'll pick like three and I'll
pay to send you T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got plenty of stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they'll be, but we've
got stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got so many sponsors and vendors and
friends that we, I've got stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll send you something really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some grassroots stickers, I read genetic
stickers, I heart dab stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got plenty of stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to tweet at Nemopunk15 and at
GFYH podcast with hashtag, I like it when
[SPEAKER_07]: you ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

[SPEAKER_07]: It's stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free stuff for listening this long,
because this kind of went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did go everywhere, but- I like it
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes dads take you fun places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since Mike's giving away shit,
I'm going to wrap up the show before he
[SPEAKER_07]: starts giving away more shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants a microphone?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants a pizza?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has gotten way off course,

[SPEAKER_07]: There's no can anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it in your pipe and smoke it.

number 103, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to rain.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is getting weird.

want.
[SPEAKER_06]: God only knows how big and wide this
audience range is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get some really random shit on this

[SPEAKER_06]: It could be fun to review.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us your products, guys.

[SPEAKER_07]: That is under construction.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend is a college student.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again to Mike for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell just tickled my arm?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a spider or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: God, that scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you not used to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that one reach over there?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get so high your body cares about
your dreadlocks again?
[SPEAKER_06]: It just tickled.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was strange.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, you guys, we're dabbed the fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you had a lot of fun with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag, I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your sticker pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't that a good idea?
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again for listening, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, yo, you got my word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, yo, you got my word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: yo, you got my word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, yo, you got my word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got my word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you got my word.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your boy, Rasta Jeff coming to you
live from the car on Interstate 25.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just left the champs trade show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it'd be a good idea to jump on
the microphone and do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: recording while it's still fresh in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: So today I went to the champs trade show
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a beautiful drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes me about two hours to get up to
Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me about another 20 minutes to
find a good parking spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I got a good parking spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I messaged a good friend of mine who had a
pass for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We met up and he got me a pass for champs.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave me a high five and told me to have
a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had shit to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he sent me on my way and I headed into
the champs trade show.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I am failing you right now
because I seriously don't know what champs
[SPEAKER_07]: stands for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Champs is an acronym for something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it means.
[SPEAKER_07]: It means something about glass and trade
show because what it was, was a trade show
[SPEAKER_07]: based on glass, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that shit said for tobacco use
only, but tobacco and cannabis smoking
[SPEAKER_07]: accessories.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it's all your shit that is
available at all the head shops that you
[SPEAKER_07]: go to depending on the quality of your
head shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was all there, all that plastic
shitty Chinese smoking accessory stuff was
[SPEAKER_07]: all there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All this shitty Chinese knockoff glass was
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the shitty knockoff nail companies
were there, but also some of our good
[SPEAKER_07]: friends were there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I got to visit the Hitman booth.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I didn't walk away from the Hitman
booth today, I was going to spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: money with Hitman.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had two rigs that I was really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the mini, they have the new,
I forget what they call them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They call them a Sunday stack or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the Sunday cup, but it's this
little stack thing, the mini stack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had water in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They let me pull through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That thing felt like it would hit like a
champ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, you guys, there was no
consumption in this venue.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were not allowed to smoke any type of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was actually somebody pressing out
rosin dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a rosin press.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know about rosin, it's made by
squishing your buds between two heated
[SPEAKER_07]: surfaces using parchment in the middle as
a way to catch your hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was pressing out rosin right there for
you so you could bring your nugs and get
[SPEAKER_07]: them squished is what they were calling
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people were taking dabs at that right
after they would squish it, although it
[SPEAKER_07]: was frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you got caught, they would escort you
out of the building.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I met up with the Hitman crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: I fell in love with a couple of rigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a mini sidecar rig with a blue
label.
[SPEAKER_07]: The blue label was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my favorite color, my exact favorite
color blue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I just bought the same rig
with a yellow label, so I could not bring
[SPEAKER_07]: myself to spend another $150 on a rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although $150 on that rig was a steal,
I just didn't want to buy a copy of a rig
[SPEAKER_07]: that I have already got.
[SPEAKER_07]: It did not make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so I had to walk away before I
bought the Sunday stack and before I
[SPEAKER_07]: bought the blue mini sidecar.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a bunch of great rigs at the
Hitman booth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I made friends with a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got to bump into our crew with Oil
Slick, Josh from Oil Slick, and the Oil
[SPEAKER_07]: Slick crew was there in full force.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sent me home with a sample of the,
I forget the official name of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been calling it the bong condom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a condom you put on the
mouthpiece of your bong so that if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: at a large party or an event, you can swap
those out so that not everybody has to get
[SPEAKER_07]: the, we call it the cup cough or the wook
flu.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they gave me a couple of those to check
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right across from our friends at Oil Slick
was our good friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to the entire Handmade and
Oil Slick family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming out to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for showing everybody how to run a
booth at Champs because you guys do it
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are great people, great people in
the industry, great service.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys make sure you support Oil
Slick and Handmade Apparel and also Hitman
[SPEAKER_07]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I made a little stop at the highly
educated titanium little booth there and I
[SPEAKER_07]: picked up a couple of highly educated
titanium products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Task was not in the building, but he had
his cronies working for him.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you support highly educated
titanium.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it sounds like a big bunch of shout
outs, but I was at an event where there
[SPEAKER_07]: were a bunch of vendors, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these guys took care of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are products that I support.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's basically, you guys, it's a big
swap meet of supplies for your head shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw every kind of pipe and bong and
hash rig and nail you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every type of hash container you could
imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was not a lot of growing accessories
or grow supplies or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all basically aimed at supplying
your head shops.
[SPEAKER_07]: With good quality glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got a list of people here that I
got to hang out with today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I even open up the list,
I don't even need to think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I walked out of my car, I walked up to,
no, as soon as I walked into the event,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was greeted by a guy by the name of
Scott Reach.
[SPEAKER_07]: He walked up to me and shook my hand,
asked how I was doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, that is Rare Dankness,
one of the most popular seed companies in
[SPEAKER_07]: the world right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: For Scott to walk up and know who I was
kind of blew my mind, to tell you the
[SPEAKER_07]: truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a few feet into the building.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I ran into the man himself,
the kosher stoner, Adam McAdoshis,
[SPEAKER_07]: our good friend, Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good seeing Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to hang out with Adam for a few
minutes, have a quick conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam was hungry, so he took off.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were supposed to link up for turps
later.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up having to drive home.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have to drive home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dinner was at seven.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were still at Hunt's house taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured we weren't going to dinner until
730, which means I would have been there
[SPEAKER_07]: till eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or no, I would have been there till nine,
maybe 930.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a two hour drive from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have put me home around 1130 or
midnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to work in the morning,
so I had to split out from dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, shout out to John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Carly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to everybody who invited me
to dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for not being able to make it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time, guys, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to Champs today on a whim.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't even supposed to go to Champs.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a poorly planned trip,
but I'm going to call it a hell of a
[SPEAKER_07]: success, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was walking through Champs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spied one of the most beautiful
women I have ever laid my eyes upon.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lovely Miss Charlo Green was in the
building.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys don't know who Charlo Green
is, she is a cannabis activist from
[SPEAKER_07]: Alaska.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's actually the lady who is known
for saying, fuck it, I quit on the news.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was at Champs.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually, I am cool, calm, and collected.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a smooth motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not afraid to talk to anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll walk up to anybody and say hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll walk into the restricted access area
and act like I own that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a shy guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for some reason, when I saw Miss
Charlo Green, something inside of me
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking melted.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, Charlo is more beautiful in
person than she has ever looked online,
[SPEAKER_07]: on Facebook, on the internet, on Twitter,
on Instagram, whatever you saw her on.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is even more beautiful in person.
[SPEAKER_07]: And her personality is sassy and stunning.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm walking toward her, and she spotted
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she reached out and put her hand on my
shoulder and said, hey, you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she knew who I was, which was kind of
weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've stalked her on Facebook and said
hello, but she has no reason to know who
[SPEAKER_07]: Rasta Jeff is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was a little excited by that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That made me a little spellbound.
[SPEAKER_07]: It made me feel like a high school boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I stopped and I asked her if I could
give her a hug.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she said, oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talked for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys, I went stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not have shit proper to say to that
beautiful lady.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't decide if I wanted to just be
like a normal dude and talk to her or if I
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to go into like business guy mode
or if I wanted to be podcast guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: My brain fluttered.
[SPEAKER_07]: That woman is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a big shout out to Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you listen to this, yes, I'm gushing
over you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the most beautiful damn woman I
have seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blew my mind, honey.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's tall, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, she was wearing some heels,
but she is tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a cop right next to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: He might pull me over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am talking into a microphone while
driving down the interstate.
[SPEAKER_07]: This cop is right next to me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like staring at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he didn't pull me over.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_07]: Charlo Green, of course, was wearing some
heels, but she was nearly as tall as me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I posted a selfie to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys will be able to see if you
check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at iRegenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, damn, honey, you are tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I put my arm around her.
[SPEAKER_07]: We took a selfie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she goes, I'm a big girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, well, I've got a shop down.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Pueblo, you should come check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I see you at the party later
tonight, we'll dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I'm not going to the party
because I do have to work in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really thinking about going to the
party.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll kill me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will hate life tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got to be a productive dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got shit to handle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to be a grown ass man.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a list of people that I wanted to
make sure I gave a shout out to.
[SPEAKER_07]: We covered Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are the Terp gatherer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are the brother, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much respect to John Hunt, the Grammy
Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my partner in crime.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like hanging out with that dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He kind of encouraged me to come up to
champs.
[SPEAKER_07]: He let me hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He kind of encouraged me.
[SPEAKER_07]: He kind of made it happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: He let me hang out at the house afterward
and stop and take some dabs at the Terp
[SPEAKER_07]: station.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for letting me come to the dojo,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, shout out to Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys don't know Adam Hill,
you got to learn about Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam Hill, he had a podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think he's doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's now working with Be Real on Be Real
TV.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Adam Hill, the guy that goes,
what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you check him out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my homie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terp champ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else do we got on the list?
[SPEAKER_07]: I am driving you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Hitman.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got oil slick.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got handmade apparel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_07]: We gave a big shout out to Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I just want to take a second to think
about that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Charlo.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, also a big shout out to Tim and
Zach and the entire crew from New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend Tim.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's part of the New Mexico medical
marijuana movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend Zach is a patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today I met their grower and another one
of their friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember both of their names.
[SPEAKER_07]: One dude was named Cedar.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other guy, his name has left my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a normal guy name.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say possibly Tyler.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's been a while and I've taken a few
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name has left my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking rude.
[SPEAKER_07]: But shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were a lot of fun to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got me into the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to hang out for a little bit and I
will probably see them on their way home
[SPEAKER_07]: because I live between Denver and New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: So stop in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take some dabs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I bumped into a young man by the
name of Tim Martin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Martin is the host of the John Doe
radio show.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't listen to the JDR John Doe
radio show, give that a listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am shouting out another cannabis
podcast, but we are not competing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do totally different shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're from Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have different views on things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We agree on a lot of things, but I'm just
saying it's two totally different shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's no competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: I fully support what Tim Martin does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Martin is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim and I actually talked about doing a
couple of shows together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the very near future, I will be
traveling back to Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be on the John Doe radio show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let you know when it happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, we will get Tim Martin to come be on
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, now that I've got the Zoom H6,
I feel like I can take the show anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not record anything today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt rude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even think about taking my gear
in there because it felt rude walking
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say hi to my friends and
hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not be that interview guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the future, I will do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a two-day event, I'll walk
around one day and be friendly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll walk around the next day with a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was more fun just catching up with the
crew this time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big shout out to Tim Martin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you guys support John Doe radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where to tell you to go look
for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The conversation that him and I had today
leads me to believe that his podcast is on
[SPEAKER_07]: iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else do we owe a shout out to?
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I bumped into a glassblower.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_07]: He now resides in the great city of
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a glassblower that is on the rise.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Instagram, he is known as at Barefoot
Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name's Will.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you support that guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to get him and his friend Blake
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about glassblowing,
the glassblowing industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I plan on having that dude on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big shout out to my buddy Will at
Barefoot Glass for hanging out with me,
[SPEAKER_07]: entertaining me for a few minutes at the
event.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always good to see Will.
[SPEAKER_07]: What up, Will?
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you listen, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to your bro that I met also.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to remember that his name was
Blake, but like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_07]: that was several hours and several dabs
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to get you guys my review of
Champs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a little bit fresh in my head
and it's also filled with shout outs.
[SPEAKER_07]: One more important shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was walking through the event and I came
across a young man who calls himself Fox
[SPEAKER_07]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: What up, Fox?
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great meeting you and your lovely
girlfriend and your puppy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big scratch to the puppy on their tummy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scratch that dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox has a lot of great shit coming up with
CBD, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about something for about a
minute and it had me completely intrigued.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox is now in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in Colorado Springs one time this
week and I am going to do my best to link
[SPEAKER_07]: up with him and get him to talk into a
microphone for you and share you some
[SPEAKER_07]: ideas that he's got.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got some amazing shit happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot wait for you guys to get to hear
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's all of the shout outs
I've got.
[SPEAKER_07]: A guy gave me an edible to try,
but I'm not going to do a shout out on
[SPEAKER_07]: that or any review until I'm able to sit
down and look at the packaging and eat it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I'm driving on Interstate 25,
going about 70 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nobody else out on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Wednesday night.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty mellow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually driving through Monument
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the city of Monument and
shout out to that cop that didn't pull me
[SPEAKER_07]: over a few miles back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm full on talking into a microphone and
that cop did not pull me over.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see, I think I've done all these
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize if I missed anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Adam Hand for throwing me
a pin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to everybody that I hung out
with today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize if I skipped you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to move on to this next part.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I was gifted from a vendor a
G-Pen mini disposable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the G-Pen disposable
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a battery already in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're supposed to use it until it dies
and then you're supposed to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's got instructions of press the
button five times to turn it on,
[SPEAKER_07]: unscrew the mouthpiece, load with your
desired, I think it said essential oil is
[SPEAKER_07]: what it said on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it said screw on the cap and then
it said press the button and inhale.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was gifted this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a yellow G-Pen disposable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the concentrate version.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have followed the instructions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I unscrewed, I loaded, I turned it on,
I screwed it back together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you guys, we're going to press the
button and we're going to inhale.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to see what kind of draws
we get off of the G-Pen disposable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's check it out right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's dead silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's shitty for podcasting,
but I loaded it with New York City diesel
[SPEAKER_07]: live resin that I got from Spence from the
Garden of Wheaton.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Spence and it tastes
really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I didn't get a bit of smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's lighting up like it should.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try this again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give it another pull.
[SPEAKER_07]: So honestly, I just got some hash in my
mouth, which tastes really good,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's no smoke and it's not working
the way that you would really expect a
[SPEAKER_07]: hash pen to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I packed it down properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with a little, a little poker so
you can, Oh, I got live resin in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I came with a little poker so that you
could pack it down in there and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: packed down in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pressed against the coil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've used plenty of hash pins in my day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one so far, two hits in,
I am ready to throw it out the fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: window.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I hadn't loaded it up with some decent
New York City live resin, it would be out
[SPEAKER_07]: the window of the car by now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm going to do, I'm going to hold
it upright to where the hash will melt
[SPEAKER_07]: into the coil when I press the button and
I'm going to let it melt for a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's lit up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I'm hoping that I've melted the
hash down gravity wise into the coil and
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hold it to where it,
you know what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where the fucking hash is melting
into the coil while I hit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to give it a third try.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to see how this goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So excuse me for one second.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get more silence, but I'm going to
try this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully we don't end up with hash down
my throat while I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_07]: No smoke and a little more hash in my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will try this again on an episode at
home when we're in the house to where
[SPEAKER_07]: we're not driving in the car trying to do
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so far the disposable G pin,
I find it to be a fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you press it five times to turn it
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_07]: It flashed and went off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to set that in the seat next to
me, next to the microphone case.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to say fail on that for
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys got to take a quick drink because
I have a bunch of chunks of wax stuck in
[SPEAKER_07]: my teeth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a live resin in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been going for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me just one second.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to set down the microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll edit this out, but I need to take a
drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got, because of that pin, I've got
melted wax in my teeth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might edit a few seconds of that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think having hash smeared across your
two front teeth.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So where was I?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking about the champs trade show,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, champs trade show was at the
Denver Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was free.
[SPEAKER_07]: They make it seem like you need to be some
sort of a vendor or have some sort of a
[SPEAKER_07]: license to get in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I don't have, well,
I do, I have an LLC and shit, but I walked
[SPEAKER_07]: up and said, Hey, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said, what company are you with?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, Oh, I was with my buddy,
Tim.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he didn't even say anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, I'm with Organtica.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they looked at Tim and Tim's with
Organtica.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they said, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she wrote my name on a little tag and
handed it to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: No questions asked.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't cost me anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Champs is a free event.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in the industry, if not,
all you're going to do is have a good
[SPEAKER_07]: reason to be there and tell them that
that's why you're there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have like a wholesale license or
something like that, you can definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: get in.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, you've got a friend that has a way
to get you into champs, if you want to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free, which is a good thing because
it's not really worth all a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: money to walk through there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was like a $5 ticket, I wouldn't
complain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a cool event.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nowhere to sit down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's illegal to Medicaid in the building.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's illegal to consume cannabis in the
building.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't even hit a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, like I said, there were a
couple of people taking a couple of rosin
[SPEAKER_07]: dabs, but they would have been escorted
out had they been caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The best part for me, honestly,
was linking up with a bunch of people from
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: What up, Anthony?
[SPEAKER_07]: What up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I forgot you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not mean to dip you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: We spent some time together hanging out,
and I almost fucking spaced it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because our conversation was just friendly
and natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't something that had to be
documented.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a good conversation,
which I love.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to also Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Jonathan, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dan, that's who was with John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a whole bunch of people saw me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my favorite part, was meeting up
with people and shaking hands and seeing
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really, really good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great place to go if you're in the
industry and you know a few people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy a lot of great glass at very
great discounted prices.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw some beautiful, beautiful glass,
but you guys, honestly, I'm not into
[SPEAKER_07]: buying really artful glass lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been buying what they call production
work and functional glass that's just
[SPEAKER_07]: clear and hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it when I spend hundreds to a
thousand dollars on a nice rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to put the microphone down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here goes the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give me one second.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't want that car to see me
talking into the mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it when you spend a lot of money or
your friends spend a lot of money on a
[SPEAKER_07]: rig, and you can only put a really certain
amount of water in there because one drop
[SPEAKER_07]: more, it splashes in your mouth,
and one drop less, it doesn't perk right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that to be really annoying on a
custom-made piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I buy production pieces that are clear,
and I think they hit like a fucking champ,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's nothing wrong with having
a clear rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even need to spend a lot of
money on a rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, you could have spent 40 bucks on
a really nice rig today and been set up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have got a highly educated
titanium nail and a carb cap for a really
[SPEAKER_07]: good price.
[SPEAKER_07]: Champs is a great place if you're looking
to come up on a rig or two, or if you've
[SPEAKER_07]: got a wholesale license, it was really the
place to buy a whole bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So also shout out to Grassroots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grassroots was there, set up in style.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for a free event, it was really a good
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great day in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: It rained a little bit, but that didn't
slow anybody down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the vendors that I really
appreciated seeing will be at the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: Cup in Denver or, excuse me, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be at the Cannabis Cup in Denver
in April, if that happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's rumors that that may not happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to start talking shit about
it on the show, but there have been rumors
[SPEAKER_07]: that that won't happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope that it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of those vendors will be available
and present at the Cannabis Cup in full
[SPEAKER_07]: force.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a Cannabis Cup in your area,
I bet those vendors will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you look out for oil slick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get an oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep your table from getting all fucking
sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitman makes really good glass that hits
like a truck every fucking time.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get new glass, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a new nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who do you go for for that?
[SPEAKER_07]: You go to Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get yourself a nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like a domeless nail and a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you need some cool ass t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who do you get your t-shirts printed
through?
[SPEAKER_07]: You go to Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another car on the highway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just get behind them and cruise for
a little while so they don't see me
[SPEAKER_07]: talking into a microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, guys, I am driving on the
interstate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are now approaching Woodman Road in the
beautiful city of Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been recording for 22 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should pay attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: More to the road than the recording,
but I'm the only one out here other than
[SPEAKER_07]: this guy in front of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get passed by a truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I've got a bunch of great shit
planned for more episodes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to put this out as a
Thursday episode or a bonus Thursday
[SPEAKER_07]: episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: This will not be your Monday primary
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to ramble for a little bit
while I was driving, see if I could
[SPEAKER_07]: actually do a car podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never thought of that before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I've got this nice gear,
I felt it would be necessary.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I've got an episode coming up
Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Monday we are going to talk about
reasons why your cannabis is not top shelf
[SPEAKER_07]: and ways that you can improve your
cannabis and make it top shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't take a whole lot for most of
you guys just to upgrade your grow just a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't cost you money.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will cost you more time, energy,
effort, and attention, which we all should
[SPEAKER_07]: have.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got an episode about CBD planned.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have an episode with Fox
planned.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an episode about blowing glass and
the glass industry coming up with our
[SPEAKER_07]: friend Will, and I'm going to try to get a
whole bunch of grow lessons planned out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some great shit in my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are going to love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
this short car episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get off the microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have anything else left to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you guys every day like my own
adopted children.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be back Monday with the full
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't judge me by the quality of this
episode, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recorded this in the car while driving
after the Champs trade show in New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: So until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time for episode number 104 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_07]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_07]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_07]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friend, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_07]: for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm your host, my friend's call.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm back in the studio, you guys,
and I'm putting this episode out as a
[SPEAKER_07]: regular Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you're having a great Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes Mondays can be a real bitch,
so I hope I make it a little bit better
[SPEAKER_07]: with the fresh episode of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not Monday for you, whenever
you're listening to this, I hope you're
[SPEAKER_07]: having a great day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've got a fat joint rolled.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've got a blunt rolled.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've got a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've got a bowl packed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've got the vaporizer filled up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've got something going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you're eating some edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you're using some cannabis
lubrication or possibly a cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: depository.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever it is, I hope it's working great
for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you're working in the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you're driving in the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever you're doing, I'm hoping that I'm
making your day a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for joining me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm back in the studio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time I was on, I did an episode from
the car, and I did a review on the Deepin
[SPEAKER_07]: Slim Disposable Vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used the concentrate version.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was in the car, I gave this thing
kind of a shitty review, but let me tell
[SPEAKER_07]: you, that was a preemptive strike.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got home and I looked at it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I had to do was pack the hash in a
little bit harder, press it down and heat
[SPEAKER_07]: it up a little bit, and it actually gave
me quite a few fat rips.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to, what is it called,
withdraw my shitty review of this product,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm going to update it, and I'm going
to give it four hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four out of five stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a vape pen that's disposable,
this is probably the best quality we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to find.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like four out of five stars,
because for a dab or a wax hit or a
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrate hit, I prefer a rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a rig for five stars,
but it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Colorado and you're picking
up some concentrates and you need
[SPEAKER_07]: something to smoke it through,
these little yellow vape pens that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to throw away when you're done,
I think these are an affordable and
[SPEAKER_07]: economical deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I apologize for the shitty review.
[SPEAKER_07]: My updated review says it's a quality
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to give the whole nation a shout
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody in America, this is for you,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Halloween just passed, and guess how many
people reported finding cannabis-laced
[SPEAKER_07]: candy in their children's Halloween
basket?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were zero reports of cannabis-laced
candy given out for Halloween this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did the same shout out last year,
but I wanted to do it again because you're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, please don't ever give children,
animals, anybody cannabis-infused candy
[SPEAKER_07]: without their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your pet's using it for medicine,
do that with discretion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't judge you there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do make medicine for your dog now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's infused with cannabis, but don't do
it just to get your dog fucked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's rude.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, keep us on a good streak.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep the recreational cannabis going well
for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys, I was at the Champs Trade
Show.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you listened to the other episode,
I'm sure you heard about that,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I was at the Champs Trade Show over
the weekend, or it was actually during the
[SPEAKER_07]: week, and I noticed something.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a really tight-knit, really close
little community that travels around to
[SPEAKER_07]: all of the cannabis shows, and they set up
their booths, and they take great care of
[SPEAKER_07]: the customers and the community,
and they really represent the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: movement, the cannabis product movement,
the cannabis industry, and a positive
[SPEAKER_07]: life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to give a big shout out to
all those people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to point them out
specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were part of that cannabis movement
that comes to the events, that goes to the
[SPEAKER_07]: events, that is part of the product
development, the advancement of the
[SPEAKER_07]: products, if you're there showing your
face, if we see each other and high-five
[SPEAKER_07]: each other and don't even have to talk,
you're part of the crew that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we see each other and just nod at each
other because we've seen each other so
[SPEAKER_07]: many times, you're part of the crew I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys make these events happen,
and we kind of rely on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've noticed that I find myself hovering
and lingering at those booths that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: there all the time because we've become
comfortable, we've become friends,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you guys are also leaders,
and you're teaching the other booths and
[SPEAKER_07]: the other vendors how to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much respect to the family that travels
around and does all of the events and
[SPEAKER_07]: supports each other, supports the
movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really great to see you guys every
time you show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome in Colorado all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever need anything when you're in
Colorado, let me know, and I will do my
[SPEAKER_07]: best to accommodate you fully.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love and respect to the whole
cannabis community and industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also big shout out to all the people
that come and learn and meet me and greet
[SPEAKER_07]: me and shake my hand and high-five me and
ask me questions and thank me for my
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to all those people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really enjoy going to those events.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a refreshing time.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so you guys, let's get down to
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is the topic for the show today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been bumping into people and they've
been talking about why some people are
[SPEAKER_07]: able to take their cannabis to the next
level and some people are stuck growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not mid-grade, but it's still not
stellar cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought that I would write down some
of the reasons why your herb, not yours,
[SPEAKER_07]: but some herb is not what we would
consider top shelf product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can talk about a few ways on
how to improve that and get your herb up
[SPEAKER_07]: to the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me work on my list here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a couple of things written down.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, the main reason I
find that cannabis is not able to be
[SPEAKER_07]: considered top shelf product is because it
has been over-fertilized.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are thinking that they can
add more fertilizer and feed it more and
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to get better product.
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually what you're doing is you are
pumping it full of nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to affect the flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be harder to flush that
stuff out in the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that you put into your plants
will affect the flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another big reason that I find a lot of
cannabis is not able to be considered top
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf product is that it was not properly
flushed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, your cannabis plants need to be
flushed for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys,
[SPEAKER_07]: your cannabis plants need to be flushed
for a minute and then you're going to get
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of nutrients for the last 14 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're an experienced grower,
there are a few things you can add at the
[SPEAKER_07]: end there, but I wouldn't recommend too
many things unless you really know what
[SPEAKER_07]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where you're really going to start
affecting your flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So be careful at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you flush for at least 14 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can over flush.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you feel like you start flushing about
14 days before you think you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: harvest and you feel like those plants can
go a few more days, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them go a few more days.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be just fine and they will taste
even better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them finish up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them ripen up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them flush out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let all the nutrients come out and you'll
be okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you guys, you may see some yellowing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope for some yellowing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means you're flushing it properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that you're getting all the
excess nutrients out of the leaves that
[SPEAKER_07]: are stored in the plants and you're going
to flush that right on out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that there aren't extra
nutrients left in the soil that the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant's eating.
[SPEAKER_07]: It means it's eaten all of its food and
it's getting cleaned up and it's almost
[SPEAKER_07]: time for harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I want to take a step back and say
over-fertilization and not flushing are
[SPEAKER_07]: both possible even when you are using
organics, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Organic nutrients can still burn your
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Organic nutrients can over-fertilize your
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful when using organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can add the wrong... I mean,
think about the way that stuff smells.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're working with some organics,
it literally smells like a pile of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you over-fertilize it, they can make
your buds taste like a pile of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, not flushing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear a lot of people say they don't have
to flush because they used organic
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to flush.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're using your own super soil and
you know that you don't need to flush
[SPEAKER_07]: because you've been flushing the whole
time, you're an experienced grower and you
[SPEAKER_07]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're using a bottled nutrient or
some sort of organics or most amended
[SPEAKER_07]: soils, you're going to need to flush,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you flush even with organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you don't over-fertilize even
with organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: This can make your cannabis better.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're using a bottled nutrient,
start with about half of what they
[SPEAKER_07]: recommend on the bottle, about half of the
dosage rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then if you see that you have a
deficiency, move up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can correct, you can always add,
but you can never subtract from what you
[SPEAKER_07]: fed your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't over-fertilize and do flush.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next thing that I see that makes
cannabis not able to be top shelf is a
[SPEAKER_07]: really poor trim job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would not believe how much very
well-grown cannabis I've seen that would
[SPEAKER_07]: have been top shelf if the grower would
have taken just a little bit more time to
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure to take all those little tiny
leaves off because we don't want to see
[SPEAKER_07]: any leaves when we're looking at the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to see trichomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to see resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to see just buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't even want to see any stick at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the little tiny stick that sticks out
of the bottom of the bud, that's all that
[SPEAKER_07]: we need.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you're trimming, make sure you
take off all those little tiny pointy
[SPEAKER_07]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get in there and clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut all the little sticks out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut your sticks off of the big gigantic
buds and trim your weed to look like just
[SPEAKER_07]: buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look in a magazine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look online.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look what good quality bud looks like and
trim it up like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can see an obvious leaf on there,
get in there with your scissors and clip
[SPEAKER_07]: it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get in there with your thumbnail and knock
that off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trim your weed like connoisseur grade weed
and it will be top shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, when you're trimming your
cannabis, make sure that you wear rubber
[SPEAKER_07]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in my opinion, top shelf herb is hand
trimmed and not machine trimmed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got machine trimmed bud that won
a cannabis cup, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wear rubber gloves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever you're touching these buds,
whenever you're touching a product that
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody's going to smoke, make sure you
wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not want to smoke your skin oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hear your skin oil or your
skin moisture sizzle in my dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just so gross.
[SPEAKER_07]: So trim your weed, wear gloves,
and use scissors, not a trim machine is
[SPEAKER_07]: something I want to stress.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So another thing that quite often deters
people's cannabis from being top shelf
[SPEAKER_07]: product is a very poor cure.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are trying to speed dry
their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, the slower your buds dry,
the better they are going to taste,
[SPEAKER_07]: the better they are going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about your goal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your goal is to eventually grind up this
bud and either roll a joint out of it or
[SPEAKER_07]: pack a bowl or stuff it in your vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or most of us nowadays are going to stuff
it into a tube and turn it into BHO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a lot of you are going to freeze it and
turn it into ice wax or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, let's think about what we're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually, most of us are going to grind
up this herb and roll a fat joint out of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when you smoke your joint,
you want it to smell good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want it to taste good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want it to get you nice and stoned.
[SPEAKER_07]: But something that you really want it to
do that you don't think about is that you
[SPEAKER_07]: want it to burn nice and smoothly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want it to burn evenly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want it to burn and make a nice white
ash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want it to burn into this hard
black charcoal looking thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That hard black charcoal that's in the
bottom of your bowl when you're done or
[SPEAKER_07]: that your joint turns into, that's
nutrients that weren't flushed out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm backing up a little bit,
but a lot of times a bad cure will make
[SPEAKER_07]: your buds not burn properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're curing your buds, you are
removing excess chlorophyll from the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are removing a water molecule from the
THC, which makes the THC more
[SPEAKER_07]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are also pulling chlorophyll,
which is making the plants taste better,
[SPEAKER_07]: making your buds taste better.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a proper cure and not a speed dry is
very important.
[SPEAKER_07]: A proper cure will definitely affect the
way that your buds burn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slowly drying your buds will suck out all
of that chlorophyll and it will suck the
[SPEAKER_07]: moisture out slowly and your buds will
burn very nice and smoothly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be nice and sticky and they will
burn very, very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got an episode all about drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to pause right now and go see
exactly which number it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either 35 or 36.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me pause for one second and go see
what it is so that I can tell you to
[SPEAKER_07]: listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you guys, it's episode number 35.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go listen to episode number 35 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast and learn all
[SPEAKER_07]: about properly drying and curing your
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, when it was episode 35,
it was called iGrowCulture, but it's still
[SPEAKER_07]: on the same feed, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's episode number 35 and it's titled
number 35, drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the formerly known as iGrowCulture
podcast, the now known as the Grow From
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the same feed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm way off topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back in the game here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are talking about a poor cure is what
makes your buds not top shelf because they
[SPEAKER_07]: don't taste good and they do not burn
properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, it is very possible to have
nice, sticky buds that are properly dried
[SPEAKER_07]: and cured that will burn like a champ,
stink up the whole fucking neighborhood
[SPEAKER_07]: and get you high as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your goal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So listen to the episode, learn how to
properly dry and cure the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing, don't try to speed dry your
weed, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not speed dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut it down, hang it upside down and let
it dry properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to give you a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, here is a major contributing factor
to why I feel like a lot of people's buds
[SPEAKER_07]: are not top shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, people really love to cut their
buds way too early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let that shit grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let it finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because the packaging on your seed
package says that those seeds will be done
[SPEAKER_07]: in 60 days does not mean that you have to
cut them down in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get yourself a nice scope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some sort of a scope where you can
magnify the size of your trichomes to
[SPEAKER_07]: where you can see how many of them have
turned opaque, how many of them have gone
[SPEAKER_07]: cloudy and how many of them are amber.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you start seeing about 30% amber
trichomes is when it's time to harvest,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are just cutting weed down
way too early.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trimming it like shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're speed drying it and then they're
trying to get top shelf prices for it and
[SPEAKER_07]: they feel bad and they feel let down.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they're not able to sell their
product for a top shelf price,
[SPEAKER_07]: you've got to let it finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've really got to let it finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even taste right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't get you high enough and you're
not even getting the right weight if you
[SPEAKER_07]: don't let it finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: That last week or two is really where it
starts packing on weight on a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the weed grow longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit cutting it too early and it will
really improve the quality of your buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, get a scope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Start watching the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit paying so much attention to your
calendar and pay a little bit more
[SPEAKER_07]: attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand you're on a schedule,
but the plants are the boss here.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want A plus top shelf buds,
this is what you're going to have to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't cut too early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you're going to have to pay a lot
more attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell by looking at the finished
product if the room got too hot or if the
[SPEAKER_07]: room got too humid or if you had some sort
of bug infestation or if there was some
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of struggle.
[SPEAKER_07]: A professional grower can tell by looking
at your finished buds what the problem
[SPEAKER_07]: was.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your buds are airy and fluffy,
you probably got too hot in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the buds have this weird texture to
them, it probably got too humid in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can spot bug damage on those leaves that
you're not cutting off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see the spider mite marks on those
leaves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay a lot of attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get good control of your rooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about the environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to set up that room to have
proper airflow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need air exchange.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to get the old stale air out of
there and you need to get fresh air in so
[SPEAKER_07]: that that plant can breathe.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to be trapped in a stale,
humid-ass closet all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither do your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also don't want to be too hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get the plants too hot,
they start foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The buds start getting wispy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like in the summertime,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it gets all hot, your junk starts
swinging down all low.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just trying to cool itself down.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plants will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts spreading its legs all far so
that it can get some air and it starts
[SPEAKER_07]: foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from too much heat, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get your grow room under control,
you will be able to produce better
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the bugs under control, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't have bugs on your plants,
your plants don't have to spend all of
[SPEAKER_07]: their energy fighting off these predators
and they're able to use all of their
[SPEAKER_07]: energy into producing delicious,
tasty trichomes and resin and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the plants focus on what they're
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the room under control is the point of
that part right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another reason why a lot of cannabis that
I see cannot be considered top shelf
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis is because the grower basically
forgot the general rules of growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He forgot to think about his lights,
his air, his water, or his soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes as growers, we get complacent.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get cocky.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get egotistical.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get overconfident.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get ahead of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes that's when you start worrying
about something that is really obscure and
[SPEAKER_07]: then you forget about something that was
really basic.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying some new trick that's really
going to improve the crop, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This new trick is going to make everything
fucking magical.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as I did that, I forgot to pH the
nutrient solution before I watered it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something stupid like that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just pay attention to the basics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay attention to your lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay attention to the air.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay attention to your water and pay
attention to your soil and everything
[SPEAKER_07]: should be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the leaves every day for bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But remember the basics.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need good lighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't have good lighting,
you can't grow quality buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can grow quality bud under a small
lamp.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can use a 250.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to grow cannabis cup
winning buds underneath a 250 watt light.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may do okay under a four.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got potential under a six.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really think if you're going to grow
cannabis cup winning top shelf A grade
[SPEAKER_07]: buds, you need at least a thousand watt
light, at least 1000 watt light.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't want to try to put more than
about a four by four or a five by five
[SPEAKER_07]: floor pattern worth of plants underneath
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want your canopy to be nice and tight
under that thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_07]: The light is the main nutrient for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the plants want more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have enough lighting and also make sure
you have the right spectrum.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Air.
[SPEAKER_07]: We sort of discussed air before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't have too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't have too much heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to find a way to replenish the CO2 by
replacing the air in the room very often.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure your pH in your nutrient
solution before you're feeding it to your
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you're checking your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you're using good quality water.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can start with reverse osmosis
water, that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you remember to check the pH,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people simply have overlooked pH
balancing their water before they add it
[SPEAKER_07]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want that about six, five ish,
depending on what strains you're running,
[SPEAKER_07]: depends on how far into flower you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: But make sure you've got your nutrients
measured properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not overfeeding the plants and
you've got them pH adjusted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your soil, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to use a good quality soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't be packing your dirt too tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need some aeration.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need some air in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need some drainage in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use good soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't overlook that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the basics that you guys need to
pay attention to that you may have
[SPEAKER_07]: forgotten that sometimes I forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm guilty of this as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all small things that I'm trying
to remind you about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't forget the basics of growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can always refer to the old rule
called laws, lights, air, water,
[SPEAKER_07]: and soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never forget those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course you got to add love in
there because I think plants grow with a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of love.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to love the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So another way to improve your cannabis,
and this is going to sound like I'm just
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to make a sales pitch here,
but you need good quality genetics,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys, unless you've got a top shelf
cultivar, and I'm going to branch here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, quit saying strands.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a strand.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't smoke different strands.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't grow different strands.
[SPEAKER_07]: We grow different strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you really want to be difficult and
technical, they are known as varietals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you really want to be an
asshole, you would call it a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a specific phenotype of a specific
strain would be a cultivar, but I digress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use good genetics, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grow a good strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're stuck on growing that strain and
you can't get it to be what you want it to
[SPEAKER_07]: be, maybe it's time to buy a pack of seeds
and run those seeds and find the one in
[SPEAKER_07]: there that does what you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you're simply held back by the
quality of the clones you've got.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be your issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: So use good genetics, do some research,
get some seeds from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not sponsored by the dankteam.com
currently.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not pay for any ads, but I can
fully recommend my friends at thedankteam
[SPEAKER_07]: .com.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have reliable seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get rare dankness, Mile High,
Canaventure, Sin City, Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are just a few of the people that I
would recommend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can get your hands on it,
get yourself some good quality seeds from
[SPEAKER_07]: a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find the best one out of there for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe that will help you improve the
quality of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's just that clone that you're
growing isn't going to get any better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe its potential is only 17% THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what you do to it, it's just a
genetic thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: My genetics say that I'm not going to be
able to jump six feet high.
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what I do, I can't jump high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a white man that can't jump.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just my genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes these plants aren't going to go
much further than their potential.
[SPEAKER_07]: So get good genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, we talked about lights,
air, water, and soil, but what we got to
[SPEAKER_07]: think about is do not overlook the
vegetative stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: From day one, when you get those clones,
when you crack those seeds, from the very
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning of the grow, you are working on
the quality of that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may just say, hey, it's a veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just put it under these weak lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need a lot of good air.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to feed it good nutrients,
but really good teenagers and good kids
[SPEAKER_07]: make good adults.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why doesn't the same shit work with
plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you need to take really good care
of those baby plants because that is the
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning of everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to create a nice root zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to create a nice thick stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a nice node structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need nice strong supported branches.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need nice topping.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a nice canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need nice pruning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just take very good care of the plants in
the veg phase, and you will be very
[SPEAKER_07]: prepared for happy, healthy plants when
you go into the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pay more attention to the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people overlook the
vegetative stage of cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a way that you could definitely
improve the quality of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys, I've got one more thing
that I really think would help improve the
[SPEAKER_07]: quality of your finished product,
and it will also help improve the quality
[SPEAKER_07]: of your concentrates if you're a hash
maker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something you really need to do is clean
your grow room, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that the floor is clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that the tops of your light
reflectors are dusted off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that the air conditioner gets
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that all the blowers and the
carbon filters, the tops of them,
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes they collect a little dust.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that your carbon filter covers
get cleaned occasionally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys, you got to go in there and
clean up.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a shop vac with a good
filter on it, get in there and shop vac
[SPEAKER_07]: the corners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean the fuck out of that grow room
because every piece of dust and
[SPEAKER_07]: particulate that is in the air will end up
sticking to your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've ever taken a picture of a
cannabis plant and there's a little hair
[SPEAKER_07]: in there, you understand exactly how bad
anything and everything will stick to your
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis plants while they're growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll never be able to get the hair out
of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll never be able to get the dust out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean up the grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got long hair, if you've got a
beard, think about keeping that shit out
[SPEAKER_07]: of the plants too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do what you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't talk too much shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got dreadlocks that go almost to my
knees.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to wear a big ass hat just to go
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to be sanitary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to be clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to be dust free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to clean up all that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that stuff is going to stick to
your buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: All that stuff is going to end up in your
finished product.
[SPEAKER_07]: All that stuff is going to end up in your
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just think about all the dust and
whatever that is at soil and whatever else
[SPEAKER_07]: you're dragging around in the grow room,
that's all going to end up in your
[SPEAKER_07]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, so I'm going to do a
quick recap.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gone through my list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go real quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want your buds to be a little bit
better than they are, maybe you could pay
[SPEAKER_07]: more attention to your feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you could flush a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could possibly trim up your buds a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could probably improve the quality of
your drying and curing methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which all you'd have to do is listen to
episode number 35, and that'll give you
[SPEAKER_07]: huge steps on how to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could probably let your plants grow a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay attention to the harvest date.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would help you out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could probably pay more attention to
the room and dial the room in a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could probably work on not having
bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another good way to improve the quality of
your cannabis is to remember the basics
[SPEAKER_07]: and remember the fundamentals of growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another huge way to improve the quality of
your grow is to use quality genetic from a
[SPEAKER_07]: reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another good way is to not overlook your
veg phase and, of course, clean up the
[SPEAKER_07]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, of course, we've got a little side
note here that says good lighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So make sure you're using proper lighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you guys, good nutrients,
good quality nutrients will get you a long
[SPEAKER_07]: way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure your plants are properly fed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a few things that I think would
work with every feed regimen.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wanted to add dehydrated coconut
water and also yucca extract, those things
[SPEAKER_07]: will definitely improve your cannabis with
almost any feed regimen.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going hydro, you're going to
have to figure out how to add those to
[SPEAKER_07]: your hydro regimen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit different, but if you've
got a soil mix going on, those things will
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely make your plants taste better.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your plants are burning and making
black ashes, you're probably
[SPEAKER_07]: over-nutrienting, over-feeding,
over-fertilizing is what I think I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to say, and you're not flushing
properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So work on those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, that's all I've got for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be back in about a few days.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to do a midweek episode,
so I will be back Monday for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a couple of few things planned.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to link up with our friend Fox.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is a busy man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is elusive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've chased him down for a day and it was
hard to find him.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did not record with him yet,
but we will in the future if everything
[SPEAKER_07]: goes my way.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'd love it if you found me on
the social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Instagram, I use the I read genetics
Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're almost at 19,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be really cool if you clicked on that
and put me up there at 19,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So follow I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I think that's all I've got for
you this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give a big shout out to my Ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until next time, you guys, take a fat dab
and give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see
[SPEAKER_03]: you next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, dude, thanks for coming to the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a news article.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find it on my computer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting it going here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise you, but I don't even need the
news article.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something weird happened here recently in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snoop Dogg has signed a deal with
Livewell, a dispensary here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_07]: to produce a strain of cannabis and market
this cannabis under the Snoop Dogg name at
[SPEAKER_07]: Livewell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that sounds like a really cool thing,
but Will's looking at me and shaking his
[SPEAKER_07]: head kind of to the side, kind of like,
eh.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys have heard the show in the
past, we've reported about Livewell
[SPEAKER_07]: putting a whole bunch of shitty ass
pesticides in their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you come to Colorado and you shop at
Livewell, you'll be disappointed because
[SPEAKER_07]: it's pretty much like going to the
shittiest street dealer you can ever find
[SPEAKER_07]: and buying the shittiest dirt weed you can
find for way too much money.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it always seems old, like old weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's probably because they're using
pesticides and low quality grow
[SPEAKER_07]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's really weird that Snoop
has come and done a deal with the
[SPEAKER_07]: shittiest, like they've got the reputation
for being the shittiest dispensary in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snoop's publicist or publishing or public
people should have done a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: research on this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a big fail on Snoop's publicists.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what you call them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Publicists.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy failed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have done a little more work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also curious, I am not a law
expert, but Snoop is not a Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: resident.
[SPEAKER_07]: How was Snoop able to participate in a
Colorado cannabis business?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very curious about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you guys have some insight on that,
Mike, if you're listening, please tweet me
[SPEAKER_07]: or come be on the show and we will talk
about how Snoop's able to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of wack, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snoop signed up with the shittiest
dispensary here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not just talking shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Colorado and you go to
Livewell and then go to almost any other
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary, go to the Spot Dispensary,
go to Green and Healthy Wellness when they
[SPEAKER_07]: reopen here in about two weeks,
you will see quality products prepared to
[SPEAKER_07]: live well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green and Healthy Turp Station is only
medical, so I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to be medical.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to talk about that for a
second.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got past the Snoop dog part.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did not even need any help from the
news article.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snoop, big fail, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need some good weed, come hit me
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll hook you up with a dispensary and
I'll show you how to grow and I'll show
[SPEAKER_07]: you how I grow and we'll produce some
quality buds for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll make a strain for you called Doggie
Style.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Will's a glass blower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about blowing
glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you brought some great looking
pieces with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: The piece right in front of me is,
is that called Illuminati or is that- This
[SPEAKER_07]: is Hatorade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hatorade.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a Hatorade.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very specific.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good, that's a good random
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did these names come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: The glass name, the color of the glass?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever the company that makes it or the
person that pulls it, there's each one.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like glass alchemy, mountain glass
arts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Tappy Tubes, D&L, Boro here in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a bunch of different companies that
pull different colors and they name it
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a few that go across the board.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Blue Stardust is one that every
company most likely has.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then there's a few, I can't think of
any off the top of my head, but that are
[SPEAKER_08]: just specifically a company made them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this a common color or is this-
Hatorade's a pretty common one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's the difference between Hatorade,
Slime and Illuminati?
[SPEAKER_08]: Illuminati is UV reactive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Illuminati looks just like Hatorade pretty
much a little bit more on the yellow side,
[SPEAKER_08]: probably, but it's UV reactive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you hit it with the UV light,
it glows.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a little Pandy from Shout Out to
Ghost Cat Glass with some UV in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Slime, of course, is a little-
Slime has that kind of- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as transparent as this,
a little more opaque.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a little bit of white in it
sometimes depending on how you stretch it
[SPEAKER_07]: and pull it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys were already learning.
[SPEAKER_07]: We learned the difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: Illuminati glass is really cool,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real hip.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not in the glass scene,
some of this episode may go over your
[SPEAKER_07]: head, but you're going to learn a whole
bunch today.
[SPEAKER_07]: The glass scene has got its own scene
happening here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got its own glass scene in
California.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The East coast has got a glass scene
popping up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are now glass galleries all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I go to glass events and I don't even-
Will and I hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are friends through the Garden of Weed
and we don't really hang out on our own,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we always bump into each other at
Illusion's glass galleries.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ran into each other at Champs.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the- Who's calling you now?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best person that could call
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Maddie, come be on the podcast again.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get so many listens when you're here,
but we run into each other at glass
[SPEAKER_07]: places, glass events all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're both huge glass enthusiasts,
which is kind of great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So does this rig have a name?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who blew this one?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Whitey Glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whitey Glass is his name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know his actual name.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll kind of bet about that,
but Whitey Glass is his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whitey, I don't even know if there's an
underscore or anything, but if you look up
[SPEAKER_08]: Whitey Glass, you'll find him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's real good.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's killing the Klein game right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Klein game.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these pieces with this weird spout on
the back, that's called the Klein,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Klein Klein.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a recycler.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the new kind of cool recycler that
everyone's liking as opposed to the old
[SPEAKER_08]: triangular shaped recyclers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is more of an internal one,
even though it's not technically internal
[SPEAKER_08]: with the drains in the- With the drain in
the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like the way those types of rigs
hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a little Klein and I love the way
that they hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to Whitey Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a sexy piece, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me more about this rubber ducky
looking guy you got.
[SPEAKER_08]: This little birdie right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a Calm Birdling.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is number 38 in the series.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of a little- Of how many?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I want to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe he's not done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe he'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've got number 38.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It came with a little tin that you can see
over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a little drawing on the top that
he did, signed and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's a little series.
[SPEAKER_08]: Calvin Mickle is his name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Calm, Combo on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_08]: I follow Combo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He makes really cool birds.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is more of one of the simpler ones,
kind of a production series that he does.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of a puck type base,
which is hollow and functional.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the perk is sitting.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a donut, which functions as
basically the head of the bird.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a beak.
[SPEAKER_07]: What color is the beak?
[SPEAKER_07]: The beak looks like green stardust,
I think is what this one is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green stardust.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he's got a couple of white wings
that are attached to the base.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you got a little club banger on
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just a little, I got this at
Illusions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a little banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk more about the bangers
here in just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my notes is all about the banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind me the artist on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is Calm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Combo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Combo.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to Combo Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys make sure you check out all these
artists on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk a lot about artists.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you go check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll list off some of my favorite artists
towards the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask Will some of his
favorites also.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will definitely give you some shit
to look at.
[SPEAKER_07]: So next up is a glorious piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this piece here on the front
called this?
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be called a cab when it's
connected like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little Dykro Iguana cab.
[SPEAKER_08]: This piece is made by Mongrel Glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is Jack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack is his name, Jack Albershart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good friend of mine from actually back in
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are people left.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys didn't bring everybody from North
Carolina out.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he's out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: He lives out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, that's funny because Maddie and
Spence moved out here close to two years
[SPEAKER_07]: ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everybody else from the town of
Dixie came out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all of the surrounding areas,
all the cool stoners are here.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just moving to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody from North Carolina is coming
out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really funny to see, but I love
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are so, the North Carolina people
are some of my favorite friends to hang
[SPEAKER_07]: out with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a different breed of folk.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're more open.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kinder.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're more polite.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got that Southern charm,
but not that Southern, I don't know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the Southern charm without the
trailer park.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, this piece, what is going on with
the piece you're telling us about?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot to look at.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is called the Safari Special.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really big, really big base with a
tiny little mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the tiny little bamboo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is pretty tiny.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try it out in a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did, it's like, it's kind of hard to
talk about it over the microphone without
[SPEAKER_08]: you people seeing it, but it's got this
giant basically shower head perk in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got like seven holes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It fucking froths like... Oh, they can
hear that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a nice function.
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of leaves on the inside with some
flower implosions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Attached to the perk.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like somewhere that Ariel the
Little Mermaid would want to kick it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It totally looks like... It's got some...
So is this a banger hanger?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would this officially be called this?
[SPEAKER_08]: I would call it a banger hanger.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: While we're on that subject about banger
hangers, I want to give us another shout
[SPEAKER_08]: out to Mongrel Glass here, because he was
one of the first, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_08]: to start using this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he even posted about it a while ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was before even bangers were a thing,
it was e-nails.
[SPEAKER_08]: When e-nails were a big thing,
he was one of the first people to start
[SPEAKER_08]: going back to the original female joint as
opposed to the male joint that people were
[SPEAKER_08]: using for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he noticed the trend of people
using attachments and e-nails and stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember him making a post about it and
everything about, I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_08]: making the transition back to just this,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was one of the first people,
in my opinion, to really... I was confused
[SPEAKER_07]: when I first saw him going back to the
female joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what's happening here?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I put my nail in this bitch now?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is new.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I saw the bangers, the club
bangers, we're going to have to talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: bangers in a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to define those.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote down the word banger, just so we
remember to talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this piece we're talking about,
you guys, I know we've been talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: this piece for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a really fat base and then it's
got, what did you call this one again?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dicro cab with an iguana, a molt,
super colorful, iguana on the front.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seat of life in the back of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seat of life, satric geometry in the
background.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when you spin it around in the back,
there's like a mid with the flower and two
[SPEAKER_07]: leaves around it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it seals up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And coming out of the clear sealed part is
three pieces of bamboo.
[SPEAKER_07]: The taller piece is the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's got two beautifully detailed
leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just one.
[SPEAKER_07]: One beautifully detailed leaf coming up
the side.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fresh looking piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's a really stylish looking
rig.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorites for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see why.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it hit well with that skinny
mouthpiece?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard you pull on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It chugs like a champ.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got to give shout outs to mongrel,
to combo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forgot this guy, whitey.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I forget whitey glass?
[SPEAKER_07]: People have called me whitey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whitey all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm writing these names down so that we
can give them a huge shout out at the end
[SPEAKER_07]: and make sure all these glass blowers get
a bunch of love.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So are these three of your favorites?
[SPEAKER_08]: In my collection?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are probably three of my favorites
in my collection for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple more clines.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple more pieces by him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got the Wyoming angler, but these are
like my daily drivers for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got one of the anglers.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys check those out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the teeth make me nervous about
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sharp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just bust those off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It scares me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've worked with more of the functional
clear prototype glass for myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more my thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So since we're talking about your glass,
I'm going to brag about my new rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got this Hitman over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a Hitman Sampson collab.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got basic Hitman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a basic Hitman sidecar design,
but then it's got this sweet, what do you
[SPEAKER_07]: call that color?
[SPEAKER_07]: Greenish, turquoise, blue.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a custom pull to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely a custom sort of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the one I've been pulling on
lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really love that rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Dougie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the clear glass that's made by like
a brand that's known like Hitman because I
[SPEAKER_07]: have nothing against these rigs,
but when you buy one of these,
[SPEAKER_07]: the function sometimes is questionable.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen friends of ours spend thousands
of dollars on a rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you put four milliliters too much
water in it, you're going to get in your
[SPEAKER_07]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you put five milliliters too short,
you get a dry dab and you choke for days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love that these production rigs that
are made the same all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that I know what I'm getting when I
buy them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I break it, I can, I don't want to
break it, but if I do, I can replace that
[SPEAKER_07]: fairly easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to the Hitman store, which is
Illusions around here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go grab one off the shelf.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not out a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you break this, this is artwork.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is art as well, but this is,
this took much.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a proto artwork.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the only one, the only safari
special that's out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'll take a picture of it and
I'll put it on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just promised that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to do it, which means you guys
need to check out my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm writing down Insta.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys got to check out my Instagram
at I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are pictures of these rigs on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why am I ringing?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so weird that the Mac book is
ringing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to decline that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're on a podcast, pull all your
shit on airplane mode.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's my advice to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the shits were.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why I was talking about rigs, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, dude, bright on for bringing
thousands of dollars worth of glass to the
[SPEAKER_07]: table.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to grab a torture in
just a second to test out some of these
[SPEAKER_07]: bangers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about the banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everybody, I talk about dabbing off the
nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I like the nail because I can
hook the titanium nail up to the email.
[SPEAKER_07]: The nails that I use are usually titanium.
[SPEAKER_07]: They go onto a male joint that points up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You drop the nail onto there, or you put
your other dome type nail inside there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like our buddy was talking about,
this dude decided to flip back to the
[SPEAKER_07]: female joint because he saw the trend of
accessories and what we're calling bangers
[SPEAKER_07]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a guy, everyone calls him
quave, but I think it's actually
[SPEAKER_07]: pronounced quav.
[SPEAKER_07]: So quave is more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quav sounds a little fancier.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, there's a guy named quav who
made what we call the banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a male joint that goes into your
rig that's got a female joint,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then it comes straight up and then it
curves out to, there are multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: different angles available.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get it at 90, a 45, probably other
angles as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then it's got just a basic,
it looks like a small, it looks like the
[SPEAKER_07]: lid to your chapstick basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's clear, it's made out of quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you heat that shit up and then you let
it cool and then you drop your dab in
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the theory, and I believe it,
is that the quartz is giving a much
[SPEAKER_07]: cleaner, more flavorful hit from your dab
compared to the titanium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really agree with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: My problem is I'm a little clumsy and I
would I'm going to break that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you got to keep that a little bit
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little more high maintenance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely more high maintenance having
the banger with the tie.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get it real dirty and then just
get it hot and hit it with one of those
[SPEAKER_08]: little brushes for the grill even almost,
those little steel wool type things and
[SPEAKER_08]: get it fresh and clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with the banger, once it gets dirty,
it's dirty.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to keep it clean,
you got to do the, you just got to keep
[SPEAKER_08]: Q-tipping it every time for every use and
all that stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heat it up all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to go down that route?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we can talk about the Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they ready for the Q-tip tech yet?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a banger, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically a banger is made out of quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them are made out of glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see a problem with dabbing out of
the glass piece, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_07]: taste as good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to last as long.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to break after heating and
cooling so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: The quartz is better quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to use anything,
quartz or tie, definitely one of the two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe ceramic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Halen honey holes are great if you're
going for something made out of quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Halen troughs are amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: The coave banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: The banger knockoffs are cool if you trust
your art.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't buy China.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really hard to tell, but yeah,
there is definitely a difference in
[SPEAKER_08]: there's quartz qualities and the Chinese
manufacturers are definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: using much lower quality quartz.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cheap as they can find because it's
just some douche over here trying to make
[SPEAKER_08]: money just exploiting the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're definitely going to find lower
grade Chinese made quartz is going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: much lower grade than American made.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like titanium.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys, I know we sound like a bunch
of snobby douches when we talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: getting a quality nail, but that's your
health.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're heating this product up to,
I don't even know how many degrees,
[SPEAKER_07]: hot enough to burn the shit out of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're putting your medicine on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're putting your hash on there and
you're smoking directly into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever's in that, you're going to dab
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's something that puts off some sort
of gas or has an oil on it or some kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: shit, you're going to dab that right along
with your earl.
[SPEAKER_07]: So get a quality nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's super important to me.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Q-tip tech, after you're done dabbing
with your banger, you got to heat that
[SPEAKER_07]: bitch up and clean it out with a Q-tip,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you don't even heat it.
[SPEAKER_08]: In theory is that if you get the good,
you get a good temperature where it's not
[SPEAKER_08]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're done dabbing, you get your good
temperature.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to do it pretty much immediately
after you grab a Q-tip, you wipe the
[SPEAKER_08]: inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be like a little bit of a,
not a puddle, but some wetness in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get it quick enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll clean it out, look good as new.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't even got to heat it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this nail, for example, I was,
I was trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a couple of weeks old now.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, it still looks pretty
decent.
[SPEAKER_08]: But on this one, you can see I haven't
done the Q-tip tech as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like in the darkness.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to look ashy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why Spence is always in there
heating that shit, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause if you take it out and you can heat
it up right after you dab, that'll work
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not going to, that's also going
to like burn it and heat, like it burns it
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Q-tip tech is definitely like the
ideal, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just definitely catching on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I saw you saying something on Facebook
about Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Q-tip tech, I don't have a problem
with the Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's these new Q-tip holders is what I
find hilarious.
[SPEAKER_08]: $300 glass Q-tip holders.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's, there's some janky ones that
you'll see going for like $150.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's literally, it's literally a shot
glass for you people at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a shot glass that a glassblower made
and put some color on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of these guys are putting
absolutely no time into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they put them up for options and they
go for like 150.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one, I will say the one that
started the whole hype on it was a two
[SPEAKER_08]: stroke and sleek collab.
[SPEAKER_08]: That they posted.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think they kind of posted it as a
joke originally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they, and then they got a ton of
hype behind it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they decided to auction it off and
they went for $2,200.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this shit was amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: These two stroke and sleek are phenomenal
glass artists.
[SPEAKER_08]: And their work goes, I mean, their work is
expensive, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was, it was a shot glass Q-tip holder
is what they were selling.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a thing to hold Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but this whole Q-tip holder thing
blew up overnight and it's insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do something with that kind of
money.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do a lot of stuff with that kind
of money.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can change communities with $22,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, $2,200.
[SPEAKER_08]: $2,200.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that be insane?
[SPEAKER_08]: $2,200 though.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still change some change.
[SPEAKER_07]: $2,200 to change your day.
[SPEAKER_08]: $2,200 would change a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people listening right now,
that would fix their whole damn car.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your car would not be falling apart.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had $2,200, I'd be straight right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing okay and I'd take $2,200.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how long ago did you make your first
Q-tip holder before it got popular?
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly like, I didn't make it as a
Q-tip holder when I first started,
[SPEAKER_08]: probably one of my first, after a month
about being on the torch, I was working
[SPEAKER_08]: with shaping to make mini tubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started making shot glasses slash
little nug jar things.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what we, what I was calling them
and my shop mate was calling them.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, yeah, nug jars, you know,
which is what they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I took it home and I was like,
oh, look, I can put Q-tips in these.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Q-tip holder.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a heady Q-tip holder.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had a buddy come in town and I was
showing him, I was like, Hey dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: heady Q-tip holder.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we joked about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was a solid two months ago,
maybe a month and a half even like,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I have a, there's a picture on my
Instagram, five weeks old on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see it on the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, I'm not lying.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not trying to be that guy,
but you know, and we, me and my buddy
[SPEAKER_08]: joked about it like, Oh, that's so stupid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, haha, like heady Q-tip holder that
would never sell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's just another like,
if it did, haha.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sure as shit, here we are a month and
a half later with $2,200 Q-tip holders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking about it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you could still make them.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I hate jumping on the hype drain
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not, I don't like doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag Q-tip holder tech, $2,200.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are going to have to go YouTube
and Instagram and so much shit after this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we talked about Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have asked you way long time ago,
but the conversation was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who should order some of the glass blowers
that inspired you, that got you into glass
[SPEAKER_08]: blowing?
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy right here, Mongrel Glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely like my biggest, he was my
biggest help getting involved in
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know him personally?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're from where he went to high school
and we didn't go to the same high school,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we are in the same county and I had a
lot of mutual friends in high school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't know each other in high school.
[SPEAKER_08]: We both ended up living in Asheville after
high school and I hit him up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I knew he was blowing glass and I was
like, Hey man, I'd love to come check out
[SPEAKER_08]: the studio.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would it be cool?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Went down to the studio a couple of times,
hung out with him, hung out with him at
[SPEAKER_08]: his house a couple of times, you know,
got to become pretty decent friends with
[SPEAKER_08]: him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bought some glass from him and then he
ended up moving out to Gunnison to work
[SPEAKER_08]: with Brian's, I don't know his last name,
Berserker Glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Berserker Glass, he was working with
Berserker who's phenomenal and he's a
[SPEAKER_08]: beast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys definitely got to look up
Berserker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out the dogs that he makes,
the balloon animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Blitzkrieg.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Blitzkrieg.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really close.
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same Blitzkrieg, Berserker, bees and crazy
noises.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Jack showed me a bunch of things on
the torch a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about probably three or four years
ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I guess, kept in touch with him over
the years and then I wanted to start doing
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he gave me all the information I
needed to do, has let me come out to his
[SPEAKER_08]: studio here, check him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's definitely my biggest,
he sold me my first torch actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was definitely my biggest help getting
into glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as guys that like, you know,
inspire me and motivate me and everything,
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Yushin, Yushin going is
definitely, he's definitely, he's
[SPEAKER_08]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_08]: Calm right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely one of my favorite like
sculptor artists or I guess he's sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: sculptor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl artist, but his birds are just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was real big into elbow for a while when
the elbow, I mean, I was on the elbow
[SPEAKER_08]: bubble for a while, but then everybody was
huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it definitely, I don't want to say it
popped, but it definitely deflated a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Salt of course, he was one of my favorites
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys check out Salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's some crazy, dirty shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then one of the, with the books,
oh my gosh, I cannot remember the name of
[SPEAKER_08]: them right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm tripping, slipping these two books.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're, yeah, it was really before glass
was a thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're these books, smoked, smoked out,
smoked volume one and two.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're books full of glass artists and
everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was before there was really a glass
scene type of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just kind of like, this was how you
found, there was no Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was like, these were the heady
artists at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And anybody in that book too, I can't
really remember anyone specific because it
[SPEAKER_08]: was a while ago, but that, but those books
definitely were like, Whoa, this is kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of sparked you a little bit stuck in your
mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And degenerate art, the documentary,
that was the biggest, I think I watched
[SPEAKER_08]: that my freshman year in college and I was
already into glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we watched it, but we were
more into me.
[SPEAKER_08]: My roommate had a bunch of roars.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had like roars and 5150 AMG straight
tube rippers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we were like, Oh dude,
there's this movie about glass on here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's watch it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that movie, honestly, I would say like
that movie like changed my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: It opened me up to my eyes to the scene of
glass that I had no idea even existed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, Holy hell, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, this is nuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to meet Bob Snodgrass at
Champs?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did meet Bob Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was really cool for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out Bob Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bob Snodgrass, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the, the O.G.
[SPEAKER_08]: Godfather of modern day glass blowing for
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: He kind of did it on accident too.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know how he did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely check out degenerate art.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any, any interest in glass or
art or just culture in general,
[SPEAKER_08]: any, it's just a really, it's just a
great, great film.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're into cannabis culture and you're
looking for something that you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: watch, that's not just weed, like if your
girlfriend's coming over and you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: watch something else, that's a good one to
watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: She might be entertained by that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just another weed movie.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really cool with that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that was only four years ago that
that documentary was like produced and
[SPEAKER_08]: made and led out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just crazy to see how far the
glass industry and the market has come
[SPEAKER_08]: from 2011 to 2015, where in 2011,
you know, kind of this underground scene
[SPEAKER_08]: that like, there was nothing on it really
until this documentary came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, like at the time in
the documentary, I believe Scott Deppie,
[SPEAKER_08]: his most expensive piece at the time was
$18,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like that's, that's a crazy amount of
money, obviously for a piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now Scott Deppie is selling pieces
for, I mean, 18 to 23,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's nothing these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got the a hundred thousand dollar
pieces going out.
So.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what, I wanted to ask you, what makes
the market do that kind of shit?
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes an artist and the market jump
up and down?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, like we said earlier,
Elbow, the guy that makes the dyno rigs,
[SPEAKER_07]: he shot up huge for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one day everyone's just selling
their elbows on Instagram for stupid
[SPEAKER_07]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes shit?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like that in the glass market?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I definitely think what happened
with Instagram definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Instagram is a huge part of like,
who's doing, you know, what's,
[SPEAKER_08]: who's what in the glass world,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they've got, you know, lots of
followers on there, people are going to
[SPEAKER_08]: think they're like oil brothers,
for example, Matt Bowlin, he's,
[SPEAKER_08]: he's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: But his first rig that he put up for sale,
it was a little coil potted green mini rig
[SPEAKER_08]: and it sold for like $800 at auction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like his first rig that he ever
sold just cause yeah, it was a hype thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess with the market, what happened
was like everybody all of a sudden started
[SPEAKER_08]: getting into it and it built really fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it went from nothing to something
like in a year, mothership prices were
[SPEAKER_08]: quadrupling just because I really don't
know what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just be kind of like, people started
finding out about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it wasn't all of a sudden an
underground thing that it was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, people had Instagrams,
they get to show their stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So people were buying more stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then everyone at the, when the market
peaked, everyone was like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_08]: like kind of like a stock market almost.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a stock market crash.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to think about it like that,
where, you know, everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh, sell, sell, sell, buy, buy,
buy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, when mothership is like,
now's the time to sell the motherships.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so everybody sells their ships or I
guess, Elbow in this example, everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: had the Brontos and they were like buying
them for, I bought mine for $2,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, I bought it from Illusions,
$2,000 brand new, sold it about six months
[SPEAKER_08]: later for $1,700.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I struggled selling it for that,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was usually like before that had no
problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely bought mine at the peak of
the, the peak of the hype.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when you got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like right when I came down for
vacation for the first time before I
[SPEAKER_08]: moved.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a great little rig.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely loved that thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but I think definitely people,
they see what the rigs are going for
[SPEAKER_08]: retail wise.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they're like, okay, that's retail.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, they put a hype price on it
and it goes for a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then eventually it's going to build up
to a point and then people are going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not paying that anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the price will start going down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden everybody starts
to sell their rigs trying to, oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: should I get rid of this now while they're
still, while it's still worth something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that in itself decreases.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depreciates the value a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny to see the mothership hype.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw the motherships go one rig,
the same rig went from 12 to 18 to 24 to
[SPEAKER_07]: 28 to 32.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're about 18.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, there was a time when you could get,
I mean, clear, clear ships were going for
[SPEAKER_08]: like 9K at 1.5K.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, holy hell, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_07]: There are new ships.
[SPEAKER_07]: One just sold for $35,000 for the new
trifecta.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a, so mothership is known for the
decline, the Taurus and the fab egg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they combined all three into one rig,
sandblasted it and put some crazy logos on
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sold it for $35,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to Scott Deppie.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing all right over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to the mothership.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see some crazy glass,
you guys, excuse me, I'm all choked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting something in my throat here.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see some nice, crazy glass,
some high quality glass, go, I just hit
[SPEAKER_07]: hashtag mothership, mothership
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mothership glass, any of that mothership
glass you find, it will impress you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially those elites, the elites and
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: The clear ones, you guys are $3,000 each.
[SPEAKER_07]: 18 to $3,000, $1,800 to $3,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: The colored ones are starting off about
$4,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a mini for a little minis for
12.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the mini with the little swing on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that's not a fixie.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking at 2,800, 1,800 minimum and
up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's like 1,800 for just the rig,
no bucket swing cap, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just all hype on names too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how long is it going to take for you to
climb your way up to the top there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like, if I ever get up there,
that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just really a matter of,
I mean, with the glass, it's kind of one
[SPEAKER_08]: of those who you know, it is definitely a
lot of what you know, but it is a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit of who you know too and who you can
sell to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm lucky enough where starting out,
I have friends from like, because I used
[SPEAKER_08]: to manage a shop back in North Carolina,
a head shop back in North Carolina for a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I've made a little bit of
connections through that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a friend who just opened up a
shop in North Carolina, Transparent Dreams
[SPEAKER_08]: on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check them out you guys, check them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: He grew up in North Carolina if anyone
wants to check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some of my old coworkers have
opened up shops.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've had outlets to put my glass into
from the get go, which is really nice
[SPEAKER_08]: because I've had one of my shopmates,
you know, he's definitely he's had some ex
[SPEAKER_08]: shopmates, not shop anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had some trouble selling his glass and
he's been doing it for two years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, you know, he struggles
selling cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm here like two months in and I was
flipping, flipping mini tubes out the door
[SPEAKER_08]: and he just, yeah, it's just a lot of a
getting networking and marketing for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to hit one of your mini tube banger
hangers the other day and it hits very
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had good work.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had little shredders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the first ones you made,
I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I gave Mike over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's his new Instagram name?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a new name on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's Team Weedon710 now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check him out you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Team Weedon710.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our buddy, Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you follow him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the whole Garden of Weedon
crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through Team Weedon, I made, yeah,
that's a nice shirt, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through Team Weedon, I made so many good
friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much, so much family.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's how I met you down here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys, we've been going for over
30 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, thank you for taking some time out
of your day to come hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start wrapping this up and then
we're going to take some dabs,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we go, let's give some shout outs
and talk about some of my favorite glass
[SPEAKER_07]: blowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, I don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to look at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't pay the money, but I do appreciate
the art.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coil condenser.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is definitely one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's his monkeys and his little bananas
and that whole little series.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to say simplistic,
but some of the more simplistic stuff that
[SPEAKER_08]: he does is some of my favorite stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, if you're into that simplistic shit,
if you like that real, it's real stylish,
[SPEAKER_07]: but real simple SD Rhino or Rhino.

[SPEAKER_07]: The name is leaving my head right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Degenerate Arts.

[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to say Borough Hustler for some
reason, but I knew that that was not it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also check out the Pipe Classic
movies on YouTube too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pipe Classic on YouTube, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Pipe Classics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a good YouTube channel or a way
for people to go learn how to blow glass?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a great one, Revere Glass on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a whole channel and that is how
I got my start into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how most people these days are
getting their start into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have like 50 something videos and
each one's a little how-to video to do a
[SPEAKER_08]: different little, you know, different
technique or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're pretty cool dudes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dustin Revere and Kevin Foot are the guys
that do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually heard of the channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize that that's what they
did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a couple of different little
things they do on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to those guys for teaching people
all the shit that they know, because that
[SPEAKER_07]: is a huge art.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give a big shout out to somebody
who will never hear this, but my buddy
[SPEAKER_07]: Ian, I'm not even going to say his real
name, but he's Ian.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a glass blower.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not even like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's kind of, he doesn't want no to write.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just wants to make glass and be a glass
artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that dude tried to teach me how to
blow glass and it wasn't his fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: That I couldn't learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was totally my fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good at several things and blowing
glass is definitely not one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a fiber optic burn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I burned my foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I burned my foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what burned me, but something
burned my damn foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not meant to blow glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to all the people that can
and shout out to Ian for trying to teach
[SPEAKER_07]: me and shout out to the raging glass crew
that tried to tolerate my dumb ass in
[SPEAKER_07]: their studio for a couple of nights.
[SPEAKER_07]: It only took me like two attempts to
realize this is not for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, if you want to blow glass,
you better be prepared for some heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you got to get in that fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to just get in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to get just, there's no,
you can't hesitate.
[SPEAKER_08]: No stopping.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_08]: And keep that shit spinning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not so much respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand why glass is so expensive to
an extent, to an extent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Raw glass in itself is expensive too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a big thing that people,
a lot of things I think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_08]: don't think about is sometimes you can get
like a rod of slime, like a, just a couple
[SPEAKER_08]: ounces of slime, just a single little
color rod can cost like $15.
[SPEAKER_08]: bucks for just a little raw.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then how many, I know they break in
the kiln sometimes when you make a rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many, what percentage of your work
will break in the kiln?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, on a good day, like I'll get
like 20% breakage, but on an average day,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like 50%.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll just be like, not necessarily like
in the kiln, but it'll like, it'll break
[SPEAKER_08]: while I'm making it or it'll some,
a piece of it'll break.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to make a new piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like my base will break because acute
angles will kill you.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have an acute angle on glass,
when it, when it cools down, it cracks.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the seal's not perfect, there's air
pockets.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just so many little, little things
that go into it and it cools down quicker
[SPEAKER_08]: than one piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's too thick, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those little details are the things that
the China glass are not going to pay
[SPEAKER_07]: attention to, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The seals, they don't use proper seals.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could, you know, some of their
seals, you could just push it with your
[SPEAKER_08]: thumb and it'll fall off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy American glass, you guys, if you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Support American glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can support a local artist,
support a local artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I buy Hitman glass, but there's a
reason for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dougie is my homie.

Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been a huge, huge help ever since I

[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll get him back here in a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll set up another podcast here in two
or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have him come talk about how to blow
glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just 30 minutes basics.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're not going to get too in
depth.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, if you burn yourselves,
I'm not responsible either as well,
[SPEAKER_07]: either as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make sure you know that you get the
burn cream, get a fire extinguisher,
[SPEAKER_07]: some aloe.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: A chef told me to rub mustard on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That I guess that would work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's just a, what's that called?
[SPEAKER_07]: A placebo.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think it works and it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it works, it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rub some mustard on it.

[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm not going to read all that stuff
that I normally read because you're
[SPEAKER_07]: probably tired of hearing it and you
probably know it all by now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to wrap it up like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give a huge shout out to my

[SPEAKER_07]: It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you
with episode number 106 of the grow from
[SPEAKER_07]: your heart podcast, your source for
cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_07]: Education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'm coming to you with another
show from the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have been traveling back and
forth between Colorado Springs and Pueblo
[SPEAKER_07]: quite a bit lately and it's an hour drive
each direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've had a lot of time to think and I
have definitely had some time to do some
[SPEAKER_07]: recording.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here I am on the microphone traveling
on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Wednesday, November 18th.
[SPEAKER_07]: I plan on putting this episode out on
Thursday, the 19th.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just going to be a bonus
episode and I hope you guys enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make a very special announcement
while I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, as of yesterday around noon,
I am no longer involved with the spot
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have severed all ties with the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not employed by them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not affiliated with them and I am not
advertising for the spot in any way any
[SPEAKER_07]: longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to say goodbye to the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't work there anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun, but I've got to do other
things with myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no hard feelings or ill will or any
hatred or anything toward the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need to move on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes there are other options in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you need to follow or need to pursue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I'm going to do with
myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that being said, let me make one more
huge announcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: As of today around noon, I am officially
the lead cultivator at Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_07]: Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I quit a job yesterday and I've
got a new job today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big shout out to Hunt and the Grammy
Gatsby and the Green and Healthy Wellness
[SPEAKER_07]: crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: A few weeks ago, it was about two weeks
ago when the owner of Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_07]: Wellness gave me a call and he said,
hey bro, do you know anybody that would be
[SPEAKER_07]: qualified to run a large grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, yeah, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he gave me a nice description of the
job and he told me what would be required.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, you know, I think I want that
job.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, no, for real, I want the
job because I'm not happy with what I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we talked about it for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I drove up and checked out the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent a lot of time in the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent a lot of time with the crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is a go, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to be working at Green and Healthy
Wellness with Hunt, with Damsel,
[SPEAKER_07]: with Randall's.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of the team.
[SPEAKER_07]: So team Dreadlocks is getting a little bit
stronger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Green and Healthy Wellness
for having faith in me and giving me the
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity to be the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'm going to be the one
producing all of the medicine for their
[SPEAKER_07]: medical marijuana shop in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a medical patient,
look forward to, we should have a harvest
[SPEAKER_07]: coming down mid-February-ish is what I
have planned in my vision.
[SPEAKER_07]: So around March, around March 1st to St.
Patrick's Day-ish, we should have some
[SPEAKER_07]: Rasta Jeff grown flowers available for the
medical patients at Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_07]: Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I want to kind of elaborate here,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to let you know why I quit the spot
and let you know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I don't want you to think that I
hate the spot or that anything shitty
[SPEAKER_07]: happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been at the spot since the middle of
July and we have been building and getting
[SPEAKER_07]: things finalized.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is no sign of having plants in
that building for at least another month
[SPEAKER_07]: or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am not, I'm not a plumber.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a construction worker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do basic things, but I've been
trying to find stuff to keep me busy for
[SPEAKER_07]: 40 hours a week in the spot for the past
month and there's nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And without plants in there, I've been
going crazy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: The building is not ready for plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not ready to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expected to be there and perform.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was hard to be there every day with
nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was making me super anxious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was making me bored.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was spending way too much time on social
media because I was bored at the shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when my buddy Hunt called and said,
Hey, we need help here at Green and
[SPEAKER_07]: Healthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It felt like the right thing to do to jump
on and be part of the team.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the spot, they run hydro.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a big, huge hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not a hydro grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a soil farmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the Green and Healthy Grow,
we're running three gallon pots of
[SPEAKER_07]: soilless mix with plants already in the
building.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are plants there waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Friday, I'm going to move plants to the
flowering room and I'm going to give them
[SPEAKER_07]: a little bit of time to veg in the flower
room in their new home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And about 10 to 14 days after that,
I plan to flower the first crop for Green
[SPEAKER_07]: and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm leaving a facility that will not
have plants until my first harvest at my
[SPEAKER_07]: new facility is finished, is what it feels
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm in it to grow, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to grow and produce quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to make a move.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to make a huge move.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an hour drive to and from work
every single day.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a soil garden with my homies,
The Grimy Gatsby and Dude It's Damsel and
[SPEAKER_07]: John Randall's Jr. So in my mind,
this is the right decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you got to just, you got to make
a move that scares you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to make a move that puts you on
the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to make a move that breaks you out
of your routine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like my life has really been
routine for the past couple of years and
[SPEAKER_07]: shaking myself up like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really puts, it lights a new fire under my
ass, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: It puts fresh ideas in my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find new inspiration.
[SPEAKER_07]: I meet new people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I go new places.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really improves my life overall when I
put myself in a uncomfortable position.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I break out of my comfort bubble and
put myself in a position where I'm not
[SPEAKER_07]: exactly sure how this is going to play
out, it always works very well for myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you guys are scared to do something,
if there's something you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_07]: doing, if there's a big change in your
life that you're thinking about doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking about making, all I can say is
grab your balls and do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Success is scary.
[SPEAKER_07]: But once you succeed and you see what it's
like to succeed and not fall down from
[SPEAKER_07]: that, all you're going to do is want to
succeed more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your goals are going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your dreams are going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your abilities to reach those dreams will
get bigger right alongside all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're afraid of something,
don't be scared, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to try and you're either
going to succeed or you're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you fail, you're going to be right
where you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to go backwards by
failing because trying something is going
[SPEAKER_07]: to give you skills.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to at least be trying
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you succeed, holy shit,
you just succeeded at something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just opened a new door to your life.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have a new thing you can do or
somewhere else you can go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is that going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be a building block for
the next places you can go and the next
[SPEAKER_07]: things you can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're scared, if you're stuck in
your comfort zone, if you're stuck in your
[SPEAKER_07]: little bubble, you guys, all I can say is
step out of that and try to do some new
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have some faith in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have some faith in yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have some faith in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you're not a spiritual or a
religious person, you can have some
[SPEAKER_07]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have some, I guess, faith is what
you need to have and don't have fear of
[SPEAKER_07]: failing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your life is good right now and you try
something and you fail, you're still going
[SPEAKER_07]: to have the life you've got.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's going to take it away from you
because you messed up trying something
[SPEAKER_07]: new.
[SPEAKER_07]: And anybody that does talk shit to you and
disrespects you because you tried
[SPEAKER_07]: something new and you failed, they are not
your friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your friends are going to support you
through your failures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your friends are going to say,
man, that looks like a challenging task to
[SPEAKER_07]: try to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm proud of you just for getting off
your ass and trying it because 75% of the
[SPEAKER_07]: people that are out there wouldn't even
have gotten off their asses to attempt
[SPEAKER_07]: what you just failed at.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't be afraid to fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to try some shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's my inspirational talk for
the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my announcement for the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am driving down I-25 on a beautiful damn
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so gorgeous out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a cloud in the sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see for 100 miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see Pikes Peak.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see the wet mountains.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is such a gorgeous day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So guys, get outside, suck up some
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_07]: The winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should talk about how to prepare your
grow for the winter, I guess, pretty soon
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's some good shit to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'm getting out of here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm rambling into this
microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope everybody has a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke some great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke some good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love one another.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be afraid to reach your goals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And until next time, you guys,
take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
[SPEAKER_07]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are having a wonderful evening,
a wonderful morning, a wonderful
[SPEAKER_07]: afternoon, whatever time it is,
no matter what, no matter where you are,
[SPEAKER_07]: no matter what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you're smoking something tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you got a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you got a joint roll.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you got something like that going
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're coming to you on November 19th.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting across the table from me,
joining us again is our good buddy,
[SPEAKER_07]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to point this microphone a
little more at your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just get the words into it a little more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get back in our rhythm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to drop this music out a little
bit and we will get down to business.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for taking time away from the new
youngster to come see me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's sleeping right now, so I get some
away time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear he's had a little head cold,
so I hope the little dude gets better
[SPEAKER_07]: really soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on the mend.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope he didn't share it with everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet, but we can feel it coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to take my vitamins.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, if you're listening,
take your vitamins so that you don't catch
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike's kids cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take your vitamins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take some emergency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, nobody pays me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just take whatever vitamins you take.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a vitamin company that would
like to sponsor a podcast, you know how to
[SPEAKER_07]: find me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to not getting sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to good health, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you hydrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're dabbing and smoking a bunch of
cannabis or a bunch of hash or eating
[SPEAKER_07]: edibles or whatever you're doing,
you need to hydrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drink more water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of us are dehydrated anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skip that soda.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drink a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ludicrous, but hydrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I need to mention something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put out an episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 106 went up on Stitcher on
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually went up today, Thursday the
19th.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some reason, Stitcher is failing
on picking it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only got one second of the show
posted.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've emailed Stitcher and let them know
that there's an issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually Stitcher just goes and corrects it
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: The show is, it's available on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's available on my website,
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, it did not work on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Stitcher's problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell because it's playing on my
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's playing on my computer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just will not play through Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys did not get to hear episode
106, I made a very special and a very
[SPEAKER_07]: important announcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recorded the podcast from my car while I
was driving.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's one of those, and you do want to
listen to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a Stitcher listener and you
have not gotten to hear episode number 106
[SPEAKER_07]: with a very special announcement,
I encourage you to either go to my website
[SPEAKER_07]: or go to iTunes and check out episode
number 106.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on the grow from your heart podcast
tab, and it'll be right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 106, very special announcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give that a listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you will appreciate what I had to
say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do apologize for Stitcher not picking up
the episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've emailed them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to wait for them to fix it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much what we can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to reach for my phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got one more thing I want to talk
about before we start getting down to the
[SPEAKER_07]: heart of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to unlock the phone here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a screenshot of something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put a lot of work into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I take time out of my day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I take time out of my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike takes time away from his family to
come over here and record.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike works 40 something hours a week in
the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So getting him to come over for an hour is
actually a little effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got an email that makes all of our time,
all of our effort worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the emails that really make it
worth putting in the energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this came from somebody, we'll just
call him Mike O, and he says, the podcast
[SPEAKER_07]: is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Best show and I've listened to them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hoping you will do more shows with longer
content like the earlier episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see a pest management
episode and more BHO shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in Michigan and took a tenure hiatus
from growing after cloning the shit out of
[SPEAKER_07]: super skunk seeds smuggled back from
Amsterdam in 93.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure changed since 04.
[SPEAKER_07]: He lists a bunch of stuff he had to learn
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he keeps it going for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he says, I've listened to all the
grow shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam Dunn, Dude Grows, Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he says, yours is the best by
far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great mix of knowledge, humor,
and irreverence in a very easy to listen
[SPEAKER_07]: to style.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost done re-listening to the entire
series again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job, brother, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Signed, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, thanks Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says we are the best podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not trying to compete with anybody,
but if I'm being called the best,
[SPEAKER_07]: then that is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: The email is turned off over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This email coil needs to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we do a dab, the next dab that we
do is for Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get plenty of emails like that,
but it was time to read one on the air and
[SPEAKER_07]: say, dude, check this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what comes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably get an email or a text message
or an Instagram message or a Facebook
[SPEAKER_07]: message once a day saying, thanks for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of stuff makes it all worth
the time and energy and effort that we do
[SPEAKER_07]: to put in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to send me an email,
it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I would really appreciate is if you
go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_07]: search for the grow from your heart
podcast, find the review section,
[SPEAKER_07]: give me a five-star review and type in a
comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: What that does is moves us up in the ranks
and iTunes, and that exposes us to more
[SPEAKER_07]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then more listeners will grow better
ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: More people will help us liberate
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So give me a little review.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about it and scared it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have a real topic we want to talk
about here, but I want to talk about one
[SPEAKER_07]: more thing since Mike is a little familiar
with this region of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the privilege on Monday morning of
going to jury duty at 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: on a cold ass Monday.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got lucky the last time I had to do it
was during the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I wasn't cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to be there bright and early and
it's fucking cold and it was so windy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of the windiest days of the
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a jury duty on a really nasty day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird because the courtroom has
skylight sort of windows that are kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: tinted behind the judge and they were
changing from black to baby blue to black
[SPEAKER_07]: to baby blue with the weather every like
10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, holy shit, what's going on
outside?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had jury duty and obviously I was not
selected.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have never selected to be a part of the
jury.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get down to when they start asking
questions and they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can go home.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I went in there with a certain thing
in mind of what I was going to see and
[SPEAKER_07]: experience and how I was going to handle
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was nothing like what I expected.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not at all like it appears on
television.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the chairs are just as uncomfortable
as they appear on television, if not
[SPEAKER_06]: significantly more so.
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, very few
similarities.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like they were mad at us and made
us sit in shitty church pews.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're in them, it feels like it was
designed to punish everyone that was
[SPEAKER_06]: selected significantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the thing that stood out the most to
me, I'm afraid of judges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just straight up a judge can say you are
going to jail and you get to do some time
[SPEAKER_07]: in jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to go get butt poked for a little
bit and there's nothing you can do about
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The judge that resided over that courtroom
was cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't know the judge personally,
but he presented himself fairly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't feel like he was passing judgment
on anybody by the way they looked.
[SPEAKER_07]: He treated the guys in suits and the lady
in her sweatpants exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was kind to everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was respectful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was a human about things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured it was going to be rigorous and
like the time, everything would be on a
[SPEAKER_07]: certain time schedule and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he went for a little bit of time and
he goes, does anybody need to use the
[SPEAKER_07]: restroom or anything?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we wait another 15 minutes?
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone's like, I can wait 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, okay, we'll go in 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys don't worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he looked up the clock and he was,
oh, sorry, it's been about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, let's go use the restroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, he was actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, at this point for the most
part, it runs like it should, like it's
[SPEAKER_06]: much more functional.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know a human that a lot of
people assume.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know judges, like I've met many of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're people too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike's a little more in that realm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike has experience in that side of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm the dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got red eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I smell like cannabis most of the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to avoid those types of folks,
but you know, now that things are
[SPEAKER_07]: changing, I'm going to have to mingle and
rub some elbows with those types of
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the judge was very fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not feel intimidated.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't feel afraid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may have given me a touch of faith in
our system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a touch more.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to know that there's at least
humans involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we've seen it from just the juror
selection part.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't kick us out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't kick out the rejected jurors
until all of the jurors had been chosen so
[SPEAKER_07]: that they knew that there were enough in
the pool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to watch the selection process
and I got to watch all of the jurors be
[SPEAKER_07]: interviewed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at the end of that, the two
lawyers and the prosecution and the
[SPEAKER_07]: defense pass back and forth a piece of
paper and they agree on which people are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be the jurors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was laughing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, it's like fantasy football for
the lawyers or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, I'll trade you the angry
white guy for the passive white lady.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I could just see him
negotiating.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew who was going to go home.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, they're going to get rid of
that guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like he's too angry and he's too mad.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants this guy to go to jail before
he's even heard the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last two times I went, the first time
I got let go before any of that started
[SPEAKER_06]: even, I never even made it to the
courtroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: They called all, but like 20 of us and was
like, the rest of you can go home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just no ceremony about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have to sign out or nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I went, that's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a case that we were going to see
that day and the lady that was supposed to
[SPEAKER_07]: be in that case committed another crime
and had been re-arrested and was going to
[SPEAKER_07]: jail and was going to be retried for all
of her shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, she got me out of jury duty that
day, but she fucked up her life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last time they got down to
like 30 people that they liked and they
[SPEAKER_06]: just waved that the rest of us want to go
home.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we all got to go home at lunch,
which was nice, but we've had friends that
[SPEAKER_06]: have selected and served on juries and
it's a hell of an experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, if you did not listen to episode
number 106, I no longer work at the spot
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I quit the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I now work at Green and Healthy Wellness
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick update.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick update.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just since 106 may have been unlistenable
on some devices.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I quit the spot guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I work at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm now the grower there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was in jury duty and I'm sitting
here thinking, I don't have to work
[SPEAKER_07]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ain't got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't mind being selected for a case.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been a very learning
experience for myself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to imagine it, but now if I'm ever
in court, I know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got a little experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to shit my pants the first
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to invite Mike while he's sitting
here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get a commitment out of you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you to come do an episode with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: About how to deal with you, how to conduct
yourself with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether you're being pulled over,
whether they're coming to your home,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether you're in public, whether you're
at a smoking event, I'd like to get you
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll get somebody else on the show
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a good idea of who we're going to
get on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to get sloppy and you
on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll make for a really interesting
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're invited.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have such different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Experiences with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to get both you guys on the
show and we can talk about how to deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about how to deal with law
enforcement and not get your ass thrown in
[SPEAKER_07]: jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I must've blown a couple of dabs into
the computer because as I was saying that
[SPEAKER_07]: part about the judge, it totally just quit
recording here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The computer got too high.
[SPEAKER_07]: The computer is too dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that we're going to have to
start running an auxiliary output from the
[SPEAKER_07]: USB down here or the mixer into the H6 and
do record this bitch in case that happens
[SPEAKER_07]: again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I can just keep recording the H6
would have kept going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we'll go get a little Roland handheld
recorder and use the headphone out on the
[SPEAKER_07]: mixer and then just run that into the
handheld recorder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that just records onto an SD card.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's no failure.
[SPEAKER_07]: The H6 would work.
[SPEAKER_07]: The handheld would work.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do something like that as a backup
plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we can just take a dab when it fails
and come back a couple of minutes later
[SPEAKER_07]: and explain that we just had a major
technical failure here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the third option.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems simplest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_06]: If y'all were wondering like what kind of
equipment we're doing the show with,
[SPEAKER_06]: just got a pile of equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's larger than your car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is the home setup.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where, this is so that you can get
the voice like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what that's for.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the home base version is pretty
elaborate y'all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The to-go version was the size of a big
cell phone basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you hear me recording in the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zach Morris's cell phone maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Zach Morris's older cell phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just went fucking saved by the bell on
this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, the program crashed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to restart it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had just given a shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't had to restart us.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just given a shout out to the judge that
resided over that courtroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt that it was fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked the way he treated people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much of that got
recorded, but I went to jury duty.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, it wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: The judge was cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to move on from that and keep
going while the computer is working.
[SPEAKER_07]: That email said that they wish I'd do more
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll come you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that got recorded in the
part before, so we may have just
[SPEAKER_07]: double-talked that part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: More grow lessons are coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get to the music.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mail us and ask us what you want us to
talk about or him to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: We may have said that before.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll recruit the appropriate people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we're double-talking
because I don't know how much of that made
[SPEAKER_07]: it to the recording, but that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want more grow lessons,
all you got to do is let me know what you
[SPEAKER_07]: want to learn about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's growfromyourheartahotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tweet me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can send me a text message.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all one memory file.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you like how that went?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was almost like a Tourette's spasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean to make fun of Tourette's
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was rude.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys want more grow lessons and shit,
I understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: The listener that sent me the email said
that he would like more lessons on BHO,
[SPEAKER_07]: and he would like a pesticide issue or
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get our friend Sean over here as
soon as I can get him back, and we will do
[SPEAKER_07]: an organic pesticide management episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I need to find ourselves some hash
experts, and we will do some hash
[SPEAKER_07]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a hash expert, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spence is a busy motherfucker,
so getting him to come over here is going
[SPEAKER_07]: to cost me like $50 an hour to get him to
come record all the time, but we'll get a
[SPEAKER_07]: hash expert.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get him to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get down to the point of the show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been going for 15 minutes,
and all we've done is talk a bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: nonsense.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been covering this a little bit
lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got three news articles I'm going to
read the headline to, and then we're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to skip all of that, and then we're going
to go to the main article that I want to
[SPEAKER_07]: talk about, but this is kind of a little
bit of a buildup.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the website called The Cannabis,
which is where I find a lot of my news,
[SPEAKER_07]: big shout out to David Magoya and Ricardo
Baca for supplying the world with
[SPEAKER_07]: up-to-date cannabis news from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found an article.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one was written on November 13th,
and it says,
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's another article.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the headline, you guys, is all I'm
going to read.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one, once again, was in The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says,
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the byline is,
[SPEAKER_07]: And then here is the third one that I want
to read, the headline too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, This one was written on November
18th, once again by Ricardo Baca and David
[SPEAKER_07]: Magoya of The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says,
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, this is an upsetting trend we've
been seeing here in Colorado in the
[SPEAKER_07]: commercial growing industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not- It depends on your perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hate that we're finding
pesticides in final product, but I'm so
[SPEAKER_06]: thrilled that we're finding pesticides in
final product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this weird duality.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is regulation working.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is when you go to the store and you
buy a product, you know there's not
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that cannabis is legal, we're a year
or so from having all of that testing in
[SPEAKER_06]: place so that you know there's no bug
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no pesticide.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no mold or mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just getting delicious
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that they're finding it,
but it's awesome that they're finding it
[SPEAKER_07]: because now we can stop it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can start teaching the growers and the
grow facilities how to stop using these
[SPEAKER_07]: products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I pretty much in the future, I predict
that the Department of Agriculture is
[SPEAKER_07]: going to create a pesticide class for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to make their own
regulations because that's who's doing
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to tell us what we
can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of are now, but they're going to
have to do a class.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of that stuff from the ground up,
like it exists in every other industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we're not allowed to access any of the
components that do this for like
[SPEAKER_06]: cantaloupe or tobacco or beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because cannabis is federally illegal,
so we're not allowed to federally test.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we can't find what works.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the labs that are doing the testing
were created by the demand the medical
[SPEAKER_06]: industry created here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like all of the labs that are up and
running around the state came from the
[SPEAKER_06]: medical marijuana days and they weren't
state mandated.
[SPEAKER_06]: The industry demanded them and created
them on their own.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when the testing labs went to apply
for DEA licensing like they should,
[SPEAKER_06]: they all got raided.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they stopped applying for DEA licensing
and just ran a testing lab anyway,
[SPEAKER_06]: without that federal certification,
meaning that they can't do organics
[SPEAKER_06]: testing or certifying or anything like
that because that's all federal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I don't think organic testing is
actually federal.
[SPEAKER_06]: The regulations for using that word are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recently, if you're a legal marijuana
business and you had organics in your
[SPEAKER_06]: name, you had to change that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about that on the show a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Three Rivers Organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you guys going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about this article a little
bit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be a trend in Colorado that a
lot of the commercial grows are using
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides that have been banned.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that sounds ridiculous, but oftentimes
these products were sprayed on the plants
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 days ago and these rules came into
effect 20 days ago so that you can't retro
[SPEAKER_07]: actively unspray your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go back and.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants that were harvested six months ago
and turned into other earth sold off and
[SPEAKER_06]: turned into other products like edibles
and concentrates four months ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't account for the time from,
so you've got to grow these plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got to flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking at 90 to 120 days there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got to be trimmed and dried and
cured.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking at another two weeks there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're what, 140 days ish, somewhere
between 120 and 150 days by now,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's engineer math, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the product has to be picked up
by the infusion company, the MIPS,
[SPEAKER_07]: whoever's going to turn it into something,
the processing facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, then you've got drying and curing
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what got us to about 150.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, yeah, we're still rolling on
almost 200 days, 200 days, 250 days before
[SPEAKER_06]: it's even processed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it wasn't standard practice
for the company buying the product to lab
[SPEAKER_06]: test it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one of the things that these
recalls are starting to create is the
[SPEAKER_06]: first company to really fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the first big policy change they
announced was we're going to test
[SPEAKER_06]: everything that comes in now, because
that's how this happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: They processed really nasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we probably dabbed some of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of these recalls have been issued
because people got sick or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's industry-wide, they're all voluntary.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're going through and doing lab
testing, when one of their products fails,
[SPEAKER_06]: they just do a massive recall on anything
with that serial number.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is admirable because that's a lot of
money that these guys are losing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's tons of money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tons of money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just measured money and weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tons of money.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dollar amounts and weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these plants could have been sprayed
200 days ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these rules just were put into effect
whenever, 30 days ago, 45 days ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's not like people are fucking up
on purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like it's ignorance.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just timing of laws in a lot of the
places.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that I want to mention is all
that weed you used to smoke back in the
[SPEAKER_07]: day before we had dispensaries,
it was being sprayed with some shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something worse than what's
happening in these dispensaries on your
[SPEAKER_07]: weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've smoked it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is quality control is one of the first
things legal marijuana created as a side
[SPEAKER_06]: industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw quality go when medical came real
popular around 2010.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quality skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a huge competition for quality
buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then around 2013, 2014, the quality
started going away and the quantity
[SPEAKER_07]: started popping up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now everything looks the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything looks real similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to make that different at
Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got fire genetics and I know how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to try to bring that quality
back to the shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep looking back at the recording
software to make sure we're getting what
[SPEAKER_07]: we're saying because we can't afford to
try to do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're talking a lot about these tainted
products.
[SPEAKER_07]: This brings me to an email or an email,
a news article.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish there was an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have been great.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one, Mike sent this to me from the
Denver Post, right on Mike for finding us
[SPEAKER_07]: the good news.
[SPEAKER_07]: The headline is, Hickenlooper issues
executive order to declare tainted pot a
[SPEAKER_07]: threat to the public.
[SPEAKER_07]: The byline is any marijuana grown with
unapproved pesticides would be removed
[SPEAKER_07]: from commerce and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, the article is from David
Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to take a drink because I am dried
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I'll read you the article.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, say something impressive.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically this story, just to save Jeff
the effort of reading a long letter from
[SPEAKER_06]: the governor, any marijuana grown with an
unapproved pesticide is now a threat to
[SPEAKER_06]: public safety just sort of by default.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any grow that's got an unapproved
pesticide use going on in their grow is
[SPEAKER_06]: currently scrambling to figure out new
pest management protocols.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause the rule in this that's going to
really throw shockwaves through the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry is right now cannabis is
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to sell a pesticide in the United
States, you need a federal certification
[SPEAKER_06]: and approval.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your product has to be tested for all
kinds of stuff because it's being sprayed
[SPEAKER_06]: on God knows what around God knows what.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every pesticide comes with a lot of
really specific rules about how they can
[SPEAKER_06]: and can't be used and what they can and
can't be used on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And cannabis right now isn't on any of
those labels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the governor just said was if
cannabis isn't on the label specifically,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't use it to grow marijuana legally
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nobody's going to put marijuana on
there or cannabis or gum just because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a caveat.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some, some pesticides have,
they're super safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use them on anything and they have
a standardized phrase for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be on the label.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the pesticide carries that specific
use designation, then it can be used on
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like we can't use anything in
this industry, but I guarantee there are
[SPEAKER_06]: countless grows around Colorado that have
been using stuff that's perfectly
[SPEAKER_06]: acceptable for tobacco or flowers or food
and has been used on cannabis for a decade
[SPEAKER_06]: or more around the country, everywhere,
just as common practice.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're scrambling right now to figure out
what they're going to replace that product
[SPEAKER_06]: with.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to make a huge difference for a
lot of growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a timeline here and I will read
part of the article.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys might try to sum it up for us,
but I'll read a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a timeline off to the right of the
article.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was thinking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I needed a little bit of hydration.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that helped out.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a timeline here and it says on
September 7th, months after marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: holds post test, find pesticides in
products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was on September 7th,
September 8th, Denver recalls Mahatma pot
[SPEAKER_07]: extracts containing unapproved pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the 18th, Denver issues two
more recalls and it keeps going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado proposes stricter rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pot products made with unapproved
pesticides recalled.
[SPEAKER_07]: On October 18th, Colorado puts what?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a real word.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just abbreviated stuff on industry to
use pesticides that are safe on pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the 21st, nature's cure of
Denver recalls pot products containing
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides and it just keeps going you
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are a bunch of incidents of these
pesticides on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to keep seeing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think it'll taper off in the
middle of next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should by summer of next year,
by spring of next year, all this shit
[SPEAKER_07]: should be settled.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody should be well educated on what
they can and can't use.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the tainted herbs should be gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the problem here is we don't have
enough testing labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you were looking to invest in a fun
size business, call us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll show you how to set up a testing
lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want you to be able to test for
residual solvents and hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need you to be able to test for
pesticides and flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need you to be able to test for molds
and pathogens in our flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need E.
[SPEAKER_07]: coli testing in the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need all the potency testing,
reliable potency testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's read part of the article.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Mike tried to sum it up,
but it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Governor John Hickenlooper on Thursday
issued an executive order telling state
[SPEAKER_07]: agencies that any marijuana grown with
unapproved pesticides is a threat to
[SPEAKER_07]: public safety and should be removed from
commerce and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The order is Hickenlooper's first word on
a months old controversy over pesticide
[SPEAKER_07]: use to grow cannabis and a more aggressive
approach than half the dozen recalls by
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver health officials have put on
thousands of contaminated products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of it later allowed back into
commerce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, you guys, that was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a really long sentence.
[SPEAKER_07]: That whole paragraph is one sentence and I
didn't have a good rhythm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I made a wonky for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, that was a lot of breath.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do those technical issues where we lost
our rhythm?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was the tech issues or
the dads after, but it definitely fucked
[SPEAKER_07]: with my rhythm.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little from column A, a little from
column B.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: The article goes on to say the order
effective immediately was a result of a
[SPEAKER_07]: collaboration with officials from several
state agencies, the department of
[SPEAKER_07]: agriculture, revenue and public health and
environment among them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says when a pesticide is applied to a
crop in a manner that is inconsistent with
[SPEAKER_07]: the pesticides label and the crop is
contaminated by that pesticide,
[SPEAKER_07]: it constitutes a threat to public safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: The order says agencies should use all
investigative and enforcement authority to
[SPEAKER_07]: end the threat, including but not limited
to placing contaminated marijuana on
[SPEAKER_07]: administrative hold and destroying
contaminated marijuana pursuant to
[SPEAKER_07]: existing law.
[SPEAKER_07]: Industry spokespersons could not be
immediately reached for comment late
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_07]: The order comes from Denver post stories
that showed how potentially harmful
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides barred for use on cannabis were
still being applied.
[SPEAKER_07]: And fought at high concentrations in
products sold to customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Denver post is taking full credit for
this executive order.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what, yeah, that's what that
sounded like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Newspapers love it when they can say we
reported something and then change
[SPEAKER_06]: happened at a state level because of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is a huge feather in their
cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've just been buying up random product
at dispensaries and taking it to testing
[SPEAKER_06]: labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say the westward started
that part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, the westward and the Denver post
both, hammered the edibles industry a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of years ago over potency issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they started doing contaminants
tests or the post started doing
[SPEAKER_06]: contaminants testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's definitely sent shockwaves
through the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely caused change at a state
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're running around like they scored
cause they fucking scored.
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been a good smack for the legal
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like there was a little bit of
shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we brought a lot of the black market
stuff with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And eventually we were going to step up
enough to where we had to play by the same
[SPEAKER_06]: rules everybody else did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've passed that point in Colorado
now significantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of the things that happen at
every employer are now going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: happening throughout the marijuana
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of that's lab testing,
some of that's recalls.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's about time it happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll keep going with the article.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, where was I?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I wanted to give a shout out to Claude
the candy man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Claude the candy man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you're on an adventure of a
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're probably not going to hear this
podcast, but Claude is taking a personal
[SPEAKER_07]: vacation and I've seen his Facebook
pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dude has never had a bigger smile.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's making a life change.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Claude, I'm proud of you bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Support sweet stone candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what made me think of Claude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs a shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it goes on to say the post also
identified how state laws that barred the
[SPEAKER_07]: use of certain pesticides were not
enforced in the testing requirements for
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticide residues were set aside.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it says a threat to safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday's bulletin specifically mandates
state agencies to determine any off-label
[SPEAKER_07]: use of the pesticides, a threat to public
safety and ensure that the contaminated
[SPEAKER_07]: products are quarantined and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a bunch of hash and pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got to watch get just destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering how high the animals,
the landfills are going to end up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they just going to burn it like back
in the day or the fire department used to
[SPEAKER_07]: just put all the bales of weed in the
fire?
[SPEAKER_06]: They still do that all over the place and
every now and then they fuck it up and get
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole town really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I think it's just going to get
blended with dirt is what it's probably
[SPEAKER_06]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it, that's kind of what
happens at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you run a soil grow and you got to
throw leaves away, you do like lasagna,
[SPEAKER_07]: you do leaves, dirt, leaves, dirt,
just smash it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The article goes on to say Thursday's
bulletin specifically meant no way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just read that part.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a, that is a stiffer approach than
the quantum quarantines and recalls Denver
[SPEAKER_07]: health officials have put on marijuana
products contaminated with unapproved
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: In most cases, the products were allowed
back into commerce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once test confirmed pesticide residues
were at levels lower than what's allowed
[SPEAKER_07]: on other consumable crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hickenlooper's order appears to leave no
room for trace amounts and recalls for the
[SPEAKER_07]: destruction of the affected plants and any
derivative products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: No trace elements.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they used any pesticide,
they find it on there pretty much bye-bye
[SPEAKER_07]: to your whole product line.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they use some of this stuff,
I mean, in years ago, they could be
[SPEAKER_06]: destroying breeding stock or I,
how many, this is most of the recalls are
[SPEAKER_06]: stemmed from a couple of bigger grows that
wholesale off, um, dried flower to other
[SPEAKER_06]: companies to make edibles or hash with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's, it's the people that bought
it that are now issuing recalls is they go
[SPEAKER_06]: through and they're like, wait,
fuck, we bought 80 pounds of that and we
[SPEAKER_06]: make chocolate bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we threw that 80 pounds in with a
thousand other pounds we bought and we
[SPEAKER_06]: made butter out of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we made edibles and now we've got
to recall all the edible batches with
[SPEAKER_06]: those serial numbers on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's huge ripples to the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see lab testing at every
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see the labs triple or
quadruple the number across the state to
[SPEAKER_06]: handle all the testing that's going to
have to take place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised to see a little
spike in price of a buck or two per
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: To help cover all this fucking costs
because yeah, it's going to play into it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but at the same time, I'm happy to buy
stuff in the legal industry because I know
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to worry about what's being
sprayed on it or what's still in it.
Man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just made the greatest argument for
legal prostitution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That applies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't just study legalizing weed in
college, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: We study legalizing other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if the hookers are tested and clean,
then it's, it's better than getting some
[SPEAKER_07]: dirty hookers.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to continue with the article
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes on to say, a company could destroy
any affected marijuana voluntarily or face
[SPEAKER_07]: administrative actions by the state to
force the destruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: According to a policy statement issued by
the chiefs of the three state agencies
[SPEAKER_07]: involved, there is no pesticide
specifically approved for use on marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: because the chemicals are regulated by the
U S environmental protection agency and
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis is illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result, there have been no tests to
show how pesticides used on marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: could affect consumers or whether their
use is safe, but state agricultural
[SPEAKER_07]: officials have allowed certain pesticides
to be used on marijuana crops only if it
[SPEAKER_07]: would not violate the restriction on the
product's label.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a violation of federal law to use a
pesticide contrary to its label.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, this applies to you and your
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_07]: This applies to you and your greenhouse
grow any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be an extra charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you got to do when you buy your,
your spray products, your pesticides,
[SPEAKER_07]: peel off that little booklet.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on the back and read it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be rules on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there will be what you should really
pay attention to is the interval of
[SPEAKER_07]: reentry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if it says not to go in the sprayed
area for four hours, you should probably
[SPEAKER_07]: stay out of there for four hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take, take that seriously.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to notice that you're
getting sick from a pesticide until you
[SPEAKER_07]: start twitching in five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you really want to read those labels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, where the heck was I, uh,
despite the prohibitions, the post
[SPEAKER_07]: revealed in its own testing that a number
of marijuana infused products contained
[SPEAKER_07]: high levels of pesticides, not allowed for
use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: What followed were a number of recalls
issued by the Denver department of
[SPEAKER_07]: environmental health after investigations
into businesses connected with the post
[SPEAKER_07]: findings.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at the last paragraph.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, you had something to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: They downplay the other half of their
findings.
[SPEAKER_06]: They found, they tested eight samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of them came back pretty dirty,
but the other six came back cleaner than
[SPEAKER_06]: the lab testing dude had seen anything in
a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but that's not news.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it should be, it should be,
but there's no scare tactic involved in
[SPEAKER_06]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's, it's really unfortunate that
there's dirty product out on store
[SPEAKER_06]: shelves, but at the same time it's all
being recalled because we've got testing
[SPEAKER_06]: labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one else has.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm such a fucked up way though.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I will try.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make myself a note,
a list of approved.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to find a list of approved
pesticides, which I need anyway for the
[SPEAKER_07]: shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just, we use basically one or two
products at the shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a pretty good pesticide regiment
going on there, but I will get a list of
[SPEAKER_07]: approved pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about that on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we do the pest management episode
that I need to work on, I've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: episodes that are like halfway written.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I just need to put them
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things have been really chaotic in my
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been driving to Springs like three
times a week to talk about getting a job
[SPEAKER_07]: and now I've got the job.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get on to the last paragraph of this
news article so that we can get Mike home
[SPEAKER_07]: to his lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, although state officials had been
battling around pesticide rules for more
[SPEAKER_07]: than a year, there was no enforcement
until Denver health officials quarantined
[SPEAKER_07]: more than a hundred thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: It said were improperly grown with
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: The state said could not be used.
[SPEAKER_07]: The quarantines came after Denver fire
inspectors found potentially hazardous
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides and marijuana growing
facilities during routine inspections this
[SPEAKER_07]: year and reported it to health officials.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I mentioned this on the show,
they found a Eagle 20 in there and when
[SPEAKER_07]: Eagle 20 is on fire and burns,
the off gas that comes from Eagle 20 is
[SPEAKER_07]: cyanide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why the fire department doesn't
want that in your grow because when it
[SPEAKER_06]: catches on fire, they really read the
label people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like know what you've got in your grow,
know what you've got in your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all going into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should read the label on any product
you're using anyway, all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should kind of be aware of what you're
putting into yourself, into your plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: into your food, feeding your dog,
read the label.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last paragraph, you guys, last small
sentence in the paragraph.
[SPEAKER_07]: The state is amid rulemaking that would
strictly limit the pesticides that can be
[SPEAKER_07]: used on marijuana only to those whose
labels allow for unspecified crops that
[SPEAKER_07]: can be used in greenhouses and that are
not prohibited from human consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pesticides allowed in tobacco cultivation
also would be approved.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So any pesticides found in any tested
cannabis equals your cannabis is now being
[SPEAKER_07]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a huge move.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike said it a minute ago, it's going to
make prices go up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's going to send big ripples
through the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody was growing with the stuff
that's being banned or was banned a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: of months back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like everyone has to change
up, but every company that buys product
[SPEAKER_06]: does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's only a matter of time before
shops are lab testing everything that
[SPEAKER_06]: comes in just as a matter of policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let alone extract companies, edible
companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think of a product like Cheeba Chee
or Dixie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Think of the new Snoop Dogg products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how much stuff they buy and process,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Snoop's new line or Rihanna's new line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, Rihanna's new line?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I miss?
[SPEAKER_06]: That might've just been a meme on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm high and I scroll through a lot of
news.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Willie's got a brand coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just came out a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're mildly famous for marijuana,
you've got a fucking brand of marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since we're on the topic,
you know, what I was going to say is I
[SPEAKER_07]: want to see since Snoop, and I'm not
dissing you Snoop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snoop Dogg, I fucking love you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snoop Dogg, I'm from California,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up, my cousin lived in Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent a lot of time in the LBC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snoop Dogg actually went to school with my
cousin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm not dissing Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_07]: He might be.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you know Snoop ain't smoking a
blunt, listening to the grow from your
[SPEAKER_07]: heart?
[SPEAKER_07]: I listen to the GGN.
[SPEAKER_07]: He should listen to the grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: And reciprocity is nice, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Snoop, bro, he signed up with the
shittiest fucking dispensary in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they are known to be the shittiest,
the most low quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're that fucking dispensary that got,
or is accused of handing out fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: potent edibles at the goddamn state fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just keep fucking up left and right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they also had a lot of pesticide issues
in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm curious to see if Snoop's products
have residual pesticides from when they
[SPEAKER_07]: were made back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Money, money, money, money.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since we're talking about like
celebrities and things that are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: have strains coming out, let's go ahead
and toot some irie genetics horns here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the past two nights, I have been
harvesting the lovely damsels dank.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually got harvested a few nights
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was finally dry enough to finish
through the final trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: So damsels dank, you guys, is jarred up
and the curing process has been begun.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a tasting party the first
weekend of December.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a private party.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would invite you, but I can't have all
you guys showing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seats taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the seats are full you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will let you know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to get damsel on the show shortly
after that so that she can talk about her
[SPEAKER_07]: new strain that I made for her.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope she likes it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait till this process is over so
I can finally get some details.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause all I've seen is three jar samples
flashed in front of my nose.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of Instagram pictures and some jar
samples is pretty much what I've shown
[SPEAKER_07]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to dig through all of those
jars and there's a whole bunch of them
[SPEAKER_06]: over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are 10 that made it to the final
round for damsel to choose from.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whichever one of those 10 she likes the
best, we will work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's human and she may reject all 10 of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That may not be what she wants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this might just be round one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's the case, then I just did a
really cool phenol hunt and I found at
[SPEAKER_07]: least three keepers out of that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's some stank and there's some
stank over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never end up bust after a good phenol
hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: A phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys listen to the episode I did about
phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember which number it is,
but make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the website, look it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super easy to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to iTunes, go to iRegeneticsColorado
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look for the grow from your heart podcast
tab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scroll through every episode is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find it you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've covered the Hickenlooper article.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got anything else you want to say
while we're on the air, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not especially.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just like- Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of changes with people in my
life this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you change jobs, but you're not alone
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've talked to a whole bunch of people
that are going through a big change right
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out for people trying to do
something that's going to make them happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be afraid of a little bit of
success.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I said on episode number 106
that nobody got to listen to because
[SPEAKER_07]: Stitcher failed us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been 40 something minutes minus
whatever I have to edit out because of a
[SPEAKER_07]: little tech issue in the middle.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I've got Mike here, Mike,
you have got to scroll through Twitter and
[SPEAKER_07]: find the hashtag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like four people who hashtag
this appropriately within the timeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get them taken care of.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you count how many people there are,
we'll put envelopes on the table and then
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll email them or they need to send us
their addresses so that we can mail them
[SPEAKER_07]: stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening again tonight,
you know who you are, direct message me or
[SPEAKER_06]: at Nemopunk15 or Jeff Eric, grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send it to at RastaJeff420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just direct message that in Twitter or
over Facebook or whatever, and we'll get
[SPEAKER_06]: you your sticker pack mailed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get your stickers to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did not forget.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got such a big grin every time one of
those came through.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good hour of just smiling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag, I like it when you ramble.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love you guys too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's put an end to that now so that
people can't jump on.
[SPEAKER_07]: No moss.
[SPEAKER_07]: No moss.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is over you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: When's this dropping?
[SPEAKER_07]: This will come out Monday, which will be
the 23rd-ish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday the something something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, calendar.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to go faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Monday the 23rd, the hashtag I like it
when you ramble sticker pack offer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweepstakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweepstakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has expired you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is no longer an offer.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you really want some stickers,
send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send the tweet to, I'm giving you so many
different Twitter addresses to talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send the tweet to at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll figure out how to get you some
stickers one way or another.
[SPEAKER_07]: I may make you do something for them,
but it won't be anything real crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably make you follow me on
Instagram and all seven of my Twitter
[SPEAKER_07]: accounts or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have seven Twitters.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_07]: Social media challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it feels like I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just rambling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of being- I love that that one's
going to stick around.
[SPEAKER_07]: November 19th.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow is my mom's birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom does not listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom doesn't grow weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday, mom.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to send her love either way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's a good way to wrap up the
show, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys make sure you follow us on all
the social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you've caught all the names and
places by now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you follow Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Search him out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to advertise your Facebook
group while we're here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, might as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't mentioned it until now,
but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow me on Facebook if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just punch that into your search.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come right up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been getting a lot of feedback on
that lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit's been blowing up lately because
anti-pop people have taken notice and are
[SPEAKER_06]: starting to get really pissed when I link
their stuff and debunk it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's led to some really hilarious little
prohibitionist, I don't know, attempted
[SPEAKER_06]: trolling, I suppose is a good way to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny because it's sort of like,
if a small child decided to lecture
[SPEAKER_06]: calculus at you, it doesn't matter how
passionate they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're never going to get it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to learn anything useful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just this weird thing that,
I mean, to be against pot at this point in
[SPEAKER_06]: history is to have failed to do your
homework.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just where the argument starts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor Randy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, poor Randy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor Randy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Randy, I slayed you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much, so much passion, so little
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a poor little troll, Randy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I done slayed you so many times and
you just keep coming back for more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need someone who likes to make memes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have time to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need somebody to help me reply meme.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have got trolls on this podcast that
listen religiously.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you need a meme, you call them to
action and we will get you some memes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The anti-pop community learned a meme like
a week ago and it's stuff that makes you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to put your head through a wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are going to have to follow Mike
so that you can help him with the meme
[SPEAKER_07]: more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't have the energy all the time
to debunk nonsense because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of nonsense.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're way off topic, you guys,
but I hashtag I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope you guys are listening still.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out if you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a rambling meme.
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook has murdered me over the past
week with all of the change your profile
[SPEAKER_07]: picture to a French flag and all of this,
and everybody talking about who's a
[SPEAKER_07]: terrorist and who is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has burnt me the shit out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even look at Facebook the past
week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find myself shunning news and social
media after events like this just because
[SPEAKER_06]: of all the, like the event itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is bad enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the hate and the fear and the idiocy
and the ignorance that led up to it's bad
[SPEAKER_06]: enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the shit that comes after is just
so much worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook just makes me want to smash my
head into the wall lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been avoiding that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, if I haven't been returning your
Facebook messages and all that stuff for
[SPEAKER_07]: the past week, you guys, but once all this
stuff stops on Facebook, once we go back
[SPEAKER_07]: to talking about football games and stupid
shit, I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little too intense right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go unfriend people because of
some of the shit that I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to tolerate some of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm not going to get all political
and get my opinion going too much on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a weed podcast, but goddamn,
some people get really, really ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_07]: really, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: When people are afraid, they do really,
really crazy, insane things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what's going on right now is
there's a lot of fear out there and people
[SPEAKER_06]: are just diving into it because it's easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a lot of fear.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys don't buy into the fear.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's hard to do in the world
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of clouds, plus the ones
we're blowing, but you got to try to find
[SPEAKER_07]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Search for the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: The truth will set you free.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And calm the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take some tabs and calm the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I feel that way about half of the
people that I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, you need a dab and a fucking
chill pill, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's been the main thought going through
my head the last two weeks is just like,
[SPEAKER_06]: dude, calm the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you need two dabs and a nappy nap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's what your life needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Bernie, if you're listening to the
podcast, bro, we're still friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two dabs and a nappy nap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bernie, you need a dab and a nap,
but we're still friends, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though we had a heated Facebook
conversation.
That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave him a dab and a nap the other day
and it worked out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you tuck him in?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just gave him a couple dabs and sent
him home and he replied or sent me a
[SPEAKER_06]: message like 12 hours later that was like,
got super high and went home and went to
[SPEAKER_06]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you drive him around in your kid's new
car seat?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Bernie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys didn't catch on, Bernie's
about three foot two, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I don't feel bad picking on him
because he's actually a good dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I'm giving him a shout out
and saying, even though we had a heated
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation on Facebook and we totally
disagree on some shit, I agree that we
[SPEAKER_07]: disagree and you're still my bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a Marine and so he's done shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a combat vet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you and all the combat vets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we didn't have vets that signed
up to go do shit or people that signed up
[SPEAKER_07]: to be Marines and army guys and air force
guys, you and I would get drafted,
[SPEAKER_07]: bro, because we're big.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be so bad at the army.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've thought about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when I was a teenager, and I had
friends that were like, I think I'm going
[SPEAKER_06]: to go sign up for the air force.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I would die twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's so not me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bro, you've played black ops with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to be in the military with me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I throw, if I get flash banged 90% of
the time, it's because I threw the flash
[SPEAKER_07]: bang.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tight pants, lots of running.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so not me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't sound the desert.
[SPEAKER_06]: The desert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't look good in camo.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weapons are loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd miss everybody on purpose,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd be like, there's a terrorist.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd be like, just kind of fake aiming
at them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
[SPEAKER_07]: tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
[SPEAKER_07]: tick, tick, tick, tick.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the listeners really appreciate
them on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Davey, if you're listening,
bro, I hope you're feeling better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night, buddy.

coming through the microphone.

is just, so this is what it sounds like
[SPEAKER_07]: when you dab with the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're taking off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you guys are missing.

and give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling good, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got problem, I talk
domestically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my girl, she does.
[SPEAKER_01]: One who called me, I smoke the marijuana
and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love is the order of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm so confident in myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing or no one that could get
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even the damn system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen properly right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very entry and living happily.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those Babylonians mess with us today,
the music will play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smoke my problems away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just chilling on the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listening to the music from Jamaica to
Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we decided to go link the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need something for the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy as a lark when the good vines stir
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the chanting starts, you get burning
fuel corrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke all day, and still we got the
earth's a rub up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dirty Babylonian rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give thanks for the state we keep the
meditation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music and more music, we burn the pagans.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ifs, no buts, no argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is my holy sacrament.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go easy, we got enough for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the hydro to rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke and get wiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlie's off for blades.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking purple ace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause sometimes the things we need in life
may be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all the time, it's gonna be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pagans ain't feeling good well,
and that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got problem at home
domestically, and my lady just wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: quarrel with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love is all around the day, you gotta find
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big man and I put my problem behind
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
Stay above the weak kids.
