some great friends of mine there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: group of folks doing a podcast known as
the iry army podcast that's right it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of members of the iry army the iry
genetics crew has made their own podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got my blessing my permission
there's no competition or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that I love that they are doing a podcast
it's a bunch of my favorite friends a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of my favorite people a bunch of my
community that myself and graybeard and a
[SPEAKER_00]: few other people have really cultivated a
nice community and they have put together
[SPEAKER_00]: a podcast in that podcast they feature a
member of the iry army and interview them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a real friendly laid-back environment
we're all friends so it's not like a tell
[SPEAKER_00]: me about your grow it's like what's up bro
how do you grow man and it's we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: just buddies and bros hanging out talking
about the grow I say we because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: cordially and kindly invited me to be a
guest on the iry army podcast so next week
[SPEAKER_00]: early next week I will be recording with
them I honestly don't know if that show
[SPEAKER_00]: goes out live or if it is pre-recorded and
edited I do think it's edited and put out
[SPEAKER_00]: at a later time I will for sure let you
know when my episode of the iry army
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is available so that you can
listen you can watch you can enjoy that
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the meantime please do go subscribe
to my friends at the iry army podcast they
[SPEAKER_00]: are on YouTube they've got a great thing
started they're getting a good flow going
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give them a shout out and a
thank you because every episode I get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of love I get a lot of shout outs my
company gets a lot of love a lot of shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs a lot of attention comes on myself
and my company from that show I do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it thank you for the love they
talk about how I got them started and how
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of inspired people and teach people
and to hear so many people say such
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful stuff about me was it felt
really good especially right around my
[SPEAKER_00]: birthday to discover that there are about
seven episodes of people just praising me
[SPEAKER_00]: for an hour it was kind of cool so I
enjoyed that it's not just them praising
[SPEAKER_00]: me they talk a lot about their personal
growth their life their style but
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody does make sure to show me some
love and our boy lemur priest was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show recently and he made sure to remind
everybody that it was my birthday also
[SPEAKER_00]: graybeard made sure to remind everybody
that it was my birthday on the show so
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a tremendous amount of
podcast love from the podcast community
[SPEAKER_00]: birthday love birthday shout outs birthday
inboxes the PO box was stuffed with good
[SPEAKER_00]: shit my mailbox was filled with good shit
it's been a great week so thank you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks once the part of that was a shout
out to everybody at the podcast over at
[SPEAKER_00]: the iry army podcast if you're behind the
scenes behind the camera behind the mic if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're involved good show you guys I'm
proud of you people were like hey can we
[SPEAKER_00]: do this show because we're gonna use your
name we're gonna use your people and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like please do that is awesome but I think
that the discord the iry army discord is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great resource for new growers for
experienced growers it's not only a place
[SPEAKER_00]: that I go for grow information and grow
advice I go there for my social
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment during the pandemic during
the quarantine time we couldn't go places
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just jump in the discord and hang
out and there would always be a dozen cool
[SPEAKER_00]: people in there some of my favorite people
are hanging out in the discord right now a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of people that I seek guidance from
it real adult advice are in the discord I
[SPEAKER_00]: go there and hang out so they've
cultivated an amazing community for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a podcast from that community
and share that and express their ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: their views their opinions their
experiences with the rest of the world I
[SPEAKER_00]: fully encourage that so I'm proud of my
friends for creating a podcast it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: even an offshoot of what I do it just says
iry army it's and it is the iry army it's
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends doing a thing they just happen
to and I respect the branding I respect
[SPEAKER_00]: the its community I appreciate it and
respect it so shout out to those guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: this all started with I'm proud of you
guys and thanks for the birthday love I
[SPEAKER_00]: went far far too long with that big up to
lemur big up to gray beard big up to Billy
[SPEAKER_00]: big up to everybody behind the scenes and
once again I will let you know when I'm on
[SPEAKER_00]: that show I am scheduled to record I think
it's a week from yesterday or a week from
[SPEAKER_00]: today I know when it is but by the time
this comes out I will be no I'll record
[SPEAKER_00]: the day after this comes out I believe
anyway enough rambling I do have some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions here in front of me this podcast
is already getting lengthy let's uh let's
[SPEAKER_00]: jump into this first message this one came
from the man with no name that makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: easy this one says hi rasta Jeff my
question is have you ever thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: making and releasing auto flower versions
of for example golden goat sun kiss he
[SPEAKER_00]: lists a lot of a it says the man he the
man with no name lists several of my
[SPEAKER_00]: strains which would make great auto
flowers then it says I know I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: with your experience it would be a doable
task I am fervently I don't know if I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what that word I can figure out what it
means I don't know if I've ever heard
[SPEAKER_00]: fervent fervor fervently that's what it
says awaiting your next new drop I love
[SPEAKER_00]: the show I literally have listened to
probably four or five hundred episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: peace and love your pal and then he does
sign it with his name which we will not
[SPEAKER_00]: reveal here on the show shout out to my
friend the man with no name this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great question that I do get asked quite
often with all of the new states
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing cannabis and all of the new
growers coming on recreational medically
[SPEAKER_00]: and even illegally I do get an influx of
requests for auto flower seeds a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people teach that autos are the way but
I'm not going to discredit auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm gonna say is this I am not into
auto flowers auto flowers are not for me
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I think about auto flowers is
there is a time a place in an end an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and a situation in which those
plants are great for what I am doing for
[SPEAKER_00]: my goals my desires my needs auto flowers
are not for me they're great for other
[SPEAKER_00]: people I always tell one of my favorite
stories I got some weird echo in the
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones I apologize if that comes
through in the recording I will fix it
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'll just keep talking I've got one
of my favorite stories to tell about auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers because a lot of people do
discredit and talk trash about autos but
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a great thing that I've seen
happen with autos there was a an illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: cartel grow it was a allegedly a Mexican
cartel grow they say it was a Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: cartel because all of the food found at
the at the campsites was all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican branded products it was all
Mexican you could tell his Mexican food
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mexican brands and things like that
I'm not even trying to generalize and be
[SPEAKER_00]: racist it was a Mexican cartel grow so
they found this grow in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Forest and they were running
large patches of auto flower plants all
[SPEAKER_00]: through the warm season here in Colorado
so they had I don't even know this square
[SPEAKER_00]: footage but we'll say hypothetically a
quarter of an acre over here that they
[SPEAKER_00]: started today then like two weeks later
start another quarter of an acre and two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks later start another quarter of an
acre and two weeks later start another
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter and then if they time it right
every two weeks they're now pulling down a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter of an acre of ganja because
they're auto flowers they'll grow they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to change the sun cycle the sun
doesn't have to do anything differently
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants are just going to grow and
flower because that's what they do if they
[SPEAKER_00]: would have put photo period plants up
there they would have had to wait until
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly Halloween maybe a little bit after
Halloween here then they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested all of it at once and it would
have been a lot of work instead they threw
[SPEAKER_00]: those autos out got them going got those
healthy threw more out threw more out got
[SPEAKER_00]: a perpetual cycle going then I would
assume that every time you cut down a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: you immediately sow more seed keep that
pattern going if you've got an eight or
[SPEAKER_00]: nine week crop and you can get those seeds
reliable at eight or nine weeks and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can plant four squares that turns out to
about every two two and a half weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pulling a crop down and if it's if
it's a Mexican cartel pulling down weed
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't give a shit about that extra
week they want product to chop up put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking container and send it to wherever
they're making money they don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: care too much about that extra week of
ripeness their customer isn't the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: going out this is this could have gone
another week that's a different client
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a different customer altogether so
they're probably pulling a crop every two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks out there my point is auto flowers
do have a beautiful time and place if the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment situation is right but it is
not for me now let me answer the main part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the question the question was will I
ever consider or would I consider making
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers of some of my popular shit
like the Golden Goat they list the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss Lemon Jeffrey blueberry butcher and
more and many more it says I do know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it essentially but that's not for me
so the quick answer is no I will not make
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers of my stuff let me be clear
that I said I will not that does not mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the future I wouldn't have I
wouldn't work with another reputable
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder big up to my buddy Dazzy at night
owl he'd be my first choice that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that I wouldn't work with somebody to
maybe kind of make a fem or an auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: project really all somebody would have to
do all the dads would have to do Daz
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got my blessing and my permission
bro maybe send me a few or let's collab
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll do but if you've got the seeds
you could do this this is how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: works this is the beauty of it I couldn't
stop Daz and I have no problem with Daz if
[SPEAKER_00]: he does this and I hope you hear this
brother he could take one of my strains
[SPEAKER_00]: anything he could buy a pack of seeds he
could find a keeper he could breed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: his autos and he could make an auto
whatever I've got he could make auto I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know auto Sun Kiss he could do it
he's got the ability the skills he's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely further along in the auto
flower game than I am so he would know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed it what to look for how to select
it and get it there more quickly and be a
[SPEAKER_00]: marketable product if you wanted to do it
he totally could do it and I'm gonna say
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm okay with that I don't even need
to be involved if you want to cut or
[SPEAKER_00]: something bro I'll send you something good
so that you could work cut out some steps
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wouldn't hurt my feelings it
wouldn't bother me because I don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers it's not as a business it's
not gonna take away from my business
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't make autos my customers
don't maybe they do want autos but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not I'm not gonna make them anyway so I'm
not gonna lose any sales if somebody makes
[SPEAKER_00]: an auto of my line because I'm not gonna
do that if I was making autos and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else made an auto of my line and just
copied my shit that that's a dick move but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna do it so if somebody else
does that's that's fair game another big
[SPEAKER_00]: factor of that is I'm not into auto
flowers so I couldn't do it my theory the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the podcast is grow from your
heart I always say grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: and breed with love I'm not in love with
auto flowers so I would just I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: care it would just be is this good enough
can we just put these out and that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what my brand is known for I read genetics
is known for putting out top quality shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been thoroughly tested my testing
is transparent if you follow my discord
[SPEAKER_00]: server there is a tab that says I read
genetics testers and I encourage everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets a test pack of seeds from me to
go to the discord and post every picture
[SPEAKER_00]: you can on that server in the tester tab
that way we can see how many of your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted what they looked like when
they're little how long you vegged them
[SPEAKER_00]: what they flower like how long they flower
the colors the shapes the textures the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes like I encourage you to post
everything if you're a tester so
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that comes from me is bred with
love it's thoroughly tested I know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is top shelf top quality if I were to make
auto flowers it would just be some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I slapped together so that all the
people asking for auto flowers could send
[SPEAKER_00]: me their money and that's not how that's
not how I operate my company to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful I make things that I know are
top quality it doesn't go out unless it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a winner unless I want to grow
it again and again and I'm proud of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show it off and when people talk
about it they beam and they light up it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't leave here it doesn't become a
product in the catalog it gets tossed it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets forgotten about so my favorite way
that I could describe it is if I were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make auto flowers it would be
like playing in a country band I could do
[SPEAKER_00]: it I could hit the drums and it would
sound like country music but it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like good country music and if you
got me playing some reggae music if you
[SPEAKER_00]: got me playing some some jamrock music or
some straight funk we could get down and
[SPEAKER_00]: it will feel like reggae music it will
feel like jamrock music you got me playing
[SPEAKER_00]: rock and roll music in a rock and roll
band it will feel good and it will feel
[SPEAKER_00]: right but if you want me to play real
country I'm not into it my heart's not
[SPEAKER_00]: into it I'll do it for the money but I'm
not gonna do it a long time and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be the best it could be there's
somebody else out there that should do
[SPEAKER_00]: that job that's how I feel about auto
flowers country music is cool if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: into that it's just not for me and that's
how auto flowers are in my opinion I also
[SPEAKER_00]: often use this analogy cannabis breeders
and selections are like music I would
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously be the fucking reggae side of
that coin and then you got other breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: out there maybe one of those breeders has
more of a a death metal vibe and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: another one of those breeders out there
has like a b-52s kind of a vibe and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody out there is full-on got that
country music vibe we all find a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of speaks to us they kind of
connects with us that talks in a way we
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy and makes plants that we enjoy and
if I if I was making auto flowers I
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly would be lying to you and ripping
you off and I'm I'm not the the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower band if that makes any sense I've
talked enough about that big up to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy the man with no name I do appreciate
that long story short brother I will not
[SPEAKER_00]: make the auto flowers myself but that does
not mean that somebody on my team somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crew will not make them and we may
one day if they're thoroughly tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: they qualify and the consumers approve we
may put the irie label on them it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: transparent and well known that I didn't
do it that they were bred by a qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: certified auto flower constructionist I'm
trying to find a fancy word for that a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder is where I'm going all right I'm
gonna stop talking for a minute take a
[SPEAKER_00]: drink then we're going to read the next
email all right I am back I am hydrated my
[SPEAKER_00]: voice is lubricated I'm ready to get this
ramble fest going again I've got an email
[SPEAKER_00]: here in front of me from somebody that
who's become very familiar to me I see
[SPEAKER_00]: your name in a lot of places if I'm online
I probably see your name there big up to
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy Dave from Ontario this message
goes a lot like this it says I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: watching the thick shells episode I did an
episode a while back about seeds having
[SPEAKER_00]: too thick of a shell it says I thought I
would contribute a question in case you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it might make a good episode this
is a great question for the show I do like
[SPEAKER_00]: this it says my apologies if there's
already an episode on this subject I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna ramble on that there's like 700
episodes and I often forget what I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: shows about so if you have a question and
you're like you probably talked about that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be afraid I may have learned
something my opinion may have changed I
[SPEAKER_00]: may have forgotten to say something on the
last time I talked about it send me your
[SPEAKER_00]: question don't be shy because there are
722 episodes I'm not gonna make you search
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way back to episode 5 to find the
answer and if it's like a hundred episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: back that's a year right that's yeah
that's a full year my education my theory
[SPEAKER_00]: my practices may have fully changed so
re-ask your new question and I may give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a completely different fucking answer
than what I gave you last time you can
[SPEAKER_00]: call me on it you can see the growth
experience don't be afraid to change but
[SPEAKER_00]: um yeah so don't be worried if somebody's
already asked the question that you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool because most people I've
learned don't really search through the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog to find the old stuff they just
ask the question hope for that I'll answer
[SPEAKER_00]: it now let's get myself on track here this
question from my buddy Dave goes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: like this it says I am growing Raphael and
Sunkiss together my first iri genetic run
[SPEAKER_00]: and I cannot wait until harvest that's a
great lineup together but that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: smell so good in that grow room that's
gonna smell like a smoothie it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like a smoothie shop a fruit stand
it's gonna smell like a good fruit jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be beautiful in there and you
said I can't wait until harvest bro please
[SPEAKER_00]: wait until they're done which is a good
part of this the question here but a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people say I can't wait bro just wait
set your mind to I am going to wait make
[SPEAKER_00]: it a game that you're gonna wait even
longer than you should and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychology will work out to recut it down
at the right time a lot of people get too
[SPEAKER_00]: eager and cut down too early and
disappoint themselves and they say next
[SPEAKER_00]: time I'll go longer do it right the first
time we'll figure it out all right there
[SPEAKER_00]: is more to this it says Sunkiss says 50 to
60 days Raphael says 65 to 70 days my
[SPEAKER_00]: question is and I like this question how
accurate would you consider your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: times also if you could comment on the
flowering times versus flowering times of
[SPEAKER_00]: other breeders are yours more accurate in
your opinion this is such a great question
[SPEAKER_00]: and a good topic it says I would be
harvesting Sunkiss on day six or would I
[SPEAKER_00]: be harvesting Sunkiss on day 60 would it
be approaching over ripeness what about
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting in the 65 70 day range and then
similar question here what harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss on day 50 considered harvesting
too early even though it is in the range
[SPEAKER_00]: all right we've got enough of the question
figured out I know exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking this is a really good question
there are two parts to the question so let
[SPEAKER_00]: me jump up and get the first part how
accurate would you consider your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: times and I think that'll segue us into a
good ramble to answer this whole question
[SPEAKER_00]: here my flowering times the flowering
times which I print on my website and my
[SPEAKER_00]: official seed packaging and you will
notice that sometimes I do go and update
[SPEAKER_00]: the website because we learn through let's
say I put out a hundred test packs that
[SPEAKER_00]: means I'm gonna get 80 to 90 reports back
and if those people tell me it took nine
[SPEAKER_00]: to ten weeks we're gonna put that on the
package but over time people will buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: product now that we've released it and now
500 people will grow it and we'll get the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio the options grow now that our test
sample is larger the options for more
[SPEAKER_00]: anomalies and outliers start popping up
and so sometimes with more test samples
[SPEAKER_00]: with larger test batches we get more data
and we do have to adjust our flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: times but I do really think that the
flowering times I list on my website are
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly accurate that comes from a few
things that comes from me growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out that comes from like I said a
second ago sending the seeds to testers
[SPEAKER_00]: when I make new seeds when I have a new
batch of seeds I'm doing it right now you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have heard me I'm looking for testers
I'm auditioning testers if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: test seeds let me say this again make sure
you listen to the seed tester episode I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it is number 590 find that episode
listen to that then the next thing is to
[SPEAKER_00]: join the discord and let me know you're
serious because I will require you to post
[SPEAKER_00]: photos on the discord server if you are a
tester where the hell was I oh testers
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody likes to test things I send a
lot of test seeds out I've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: test seeds out there right now when I get
new stuff I send out testers I'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: send somewhere between 25 and 100 I know
that's a random number but it just depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on honestly how many of the seeds I've got
and sometimes I can see what I want right
[SPEAKER_00]: away sometimes I know exactly what I've
made sometimes art and then sometimes I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like I better run that a few more times
we've got one right now that I'm testing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had about 20 people say it was
looking good one person came up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird anomaly that I've never seen before
and so I sent out 25 more packs just to
[SPEAKER_00]: see like I said numbers maybe maybe
somebody will see that again and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: have more research more data so we do a
lot of testing my testers all have
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels of experience different
environments different lights different
[SPEAKER_00]: soil different maybe not even soil
different cocoa different hydro different
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients different air conditioners
different filters they've got different
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of different setups so I let
different people run the same seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I put all of that data together I get
all of these grow reports and I'll put all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the we're just gonna say that right now
people are testing let's talk about one
[SPEAKER_00]: that finished testing just recently and
that'll make it more easy for me to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about a strain I recently was testing
Bubba Kush cross to arise it's the pre-98
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Kush the female pollinated by the
male arise King Solomon that's it passed
[SPEAKER_00]: testing it has been officially named that
is the moon tower so people were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we sent out a bunch of packs of moon
tower nobody knew what they had they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that I got a lot of feedback
people sent me like just a list of people
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me all their grow reports I've got it
all on in an email all on discord and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just open up a little file that says moon
tower and then I'll put your name and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put all the details that you send me
in a list and then I kind of can do it's I
[SPEAKER_00]: could just see commonalities like oh tall
smells like pinecones smells like gas
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me lazy gives me the giggles I can
find the commonalities in there and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of how we list our descriptions that
is also how I come up with flowering times
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is mostly going to be 8 to 10
weeks sometimes and rarely less than 8
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks sometimes 10 12 14 16 weeks just
depends on what you've got so I let a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of people run it most of the time
they give me very common reports I get
[SPEAKER_00]: like this one was done at 63 or this one
was done and a lot of times getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: tester to go past 70 days is also a
challenge so that's something that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to do I've got to run those on my own
sometimes I get a lot of reports and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just see like I watch the the
flavor reports the growth statistics and
[SPEAKER_00]: character characteristics I watch for
flowering times just like I do all those
[SPEAKER_00]: other feedbacks then I kind of do a law of
averages if a lot of people say this takes
[SPEAKER_00]: nine weeks I will tell you that it takes
nine to ten weeks I try to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra week because like I talked about
earlier people get eager and anxious and
[SPEAKER_00]: they cut shit down too early and if it
takes nine weeks I'll put ten weeks on
[SPEAKER_00]: that package just sometimes to encourage
you to go that extra week also sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: that extra week is where some of the stuff
really bulks up and beefs up so how
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate are my flowering times in my
opinion in my experience they are fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate I do offer a two-week range on
most of the packages now let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: something very important these plants are
being grown in different environments they
[SPEAKER_00]: mean they may be grown in a dry climate
they may be grown in a wet climate they
[SPEAKER_00]: may get overwatered underwatered overfed
underfed abused loved cherished insulted
[SPEAKER_00]: they could get a lot of different shit
every one of those things I mentioned can
[SPEAKER_00]: alter the flowering time also phenotype
maybe you got the let's talk about sun
[SPEAKER_00]: kiss because sun kiss is one that could
really this could really happen that tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning phenotype that's done in 56 55
days if you get that more golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning phenotype that's a 65 day or so
you could have both of those from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds it's just phenotype
dependent and a lot of people really like
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that golden goat dominant
phenotype it's golden goat with oranges on
[SPEAKER_00]: it a lot of people like finding that tangy
phenotype because it's tangy with golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat potency and then somebody's gonna
want the one right in the middle so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all about finding the one that works for
you but the point is the phenotypes are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make a difference and a lot of
people don't like the f1s because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype variation I love it a lot of
people like that you could find the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that is for you so that is why I give you
approximately a two-week window within
[SPEAKER_00]: there are always outliers this is nature
this is science and nature coming together
[SPEAKER_00]: there will always be outliers if I say 55
to 65 days there will be 50 day flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and there will be 90 day flowers that's
just how genetics are gonna work I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you the best idea that I can always
pay attention to the trichomes always go
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion if I told you 70 days if I
told you 65 days in the first run always
[SPEAKER_00]: go to that last number that's what I
encourage I want you to see what it does
[SPEAKER_00]: let's watch it see what why are you gonna
cut it down to early it might bulk up it
[SPEAKER_00]: might get more potent it might do some
cool shit might get some cool colors
[SPEAKER_00]: always go to that last part so how
accurate do I consider my flowering times
[SPEAKER_00]: to be I like to think they're accurate
because I do a lot of testing a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of testing I'm making it very transparent
I'm having a lot of fun making the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: transparent because you guys can already
see what's coming and it makes people
[SPEAKER_00]: super excited about it and it builds a
little bit of hype and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: mystery I don't tell you what you've got
when I send you testers but I know I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a legend and I'm like oh our buddy
Dave over here is testing product number
[SPEAKER_00]: five and then I know that you've got Bubba
Kush to arise and you don't know it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just watching you grow and comparing
yours to lemurs and lefties and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever else is growing whatever I'm just
throwing out random names don't think I
[SPEAKER_00]: just told you what you've got I made shit
up just now but I'm comparing notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: watching pictures and just getting excited
for you and then when everybody's close to
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing I start telling you what it is
I'm like everybody in this group has the
[SPEAKER_00]: same stuff and everybody in this group has
the same then we reveal what it is it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of fun I love the testing so that is
how I determine what to write on the
[SPEAKER_00]: packages I watch what the testers do I use
their feedback kind of average that and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know by the male plant and the female
plant what to expect in flowering time
[SPEAKER_00]: also so I have some anticipation there I
don't tell the testers how long to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: flower I tell them let it go till it's
done sometimes like I said it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: let them go past 70 days for a tester all
right so I've answered the first part how
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate are my flowering times where do
we go from there my flowering times versus
[SPEAKER_00]: other breeders I can't I'm I don't know
honestly what the other breeders type on
[SPEAKER_00]: their packages unless I'm buying that seed
pack and running it that's not my business
[SPEAKER_00]: literally not my business I'm gonna focus
on what I read genetics does and we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna praise or bash any other company
yeah that we'll just leave it at that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what other breeder I don't know
what they're doing it's not my business
[SPEAKER_00]: quite literally so then you're talking
about would harvesting sun kiss on day 60
[SPEAKER_00]: be approaching over ripeness all right
this is where I'm going to say this is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be plant specific I don't know your
grow I don't know what you're doing I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know how hot cold dry wet humid
overfed underfed abused loved kissed
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipop to defoliated overheated stressed
dark interrupted I don't know what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got going on in there so I really would
say watch every single plant you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: just so if you've got a pack of sun kiss
and a pack of strawberry starburst you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't just say the strawberry are done it
one day and the sun kisser done it another
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to watch every single plant in
there and pay attention to each one I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that is probably not the answer you want
but that is it's the way it's got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done if you want perfection now in a
commercial grow environment I would take
[SPEAKER_00]: all these to 65 days probably six about 60
65 days and then just chop them because in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial environment it's in a
commercial environment most of the time we
[SPEAKER_00]: go nine weeks 63 days unless it's a unless
the owners are really cool then you go
[SPEAKER_00]: seven we are 70 days the 10 weeks but in a
commercial grow these would probably all
[SPEAKER_00]: come down at the end of week nine to be
honest with you what I would do um I would
[SPEAKER_00]: find if you want to run these together
this is the inaugural run this is your
[SPEAKER_00]: first date I would find um find two that
work well together something just went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with that fucking camera we're gonna
have to finish the whole episode on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one we're gonna wrap it up quick that
camera just took a shit fuck you camera
[SPEAKER_00]: one um I hope I got this so let's keep
going um I would find phenotypes it works
[SPEAKER_00]: well together and grow them together or
find phenotypes that are completely
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite that complement each other and
run them you can grow them at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time that's not a problem you're just
gonna have to time it when it comes time
[SPEAKER_00]: to flushing which will be cool because
that will save you on the headache of
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming if you've got the Raphael that
comes down closer to day 70 and the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: kiss that comes down closer to day 50
that's hypothetical that gives you nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks of dry cure and trim time you
could almost get one down dry it trim it
[SPEAKER_00]: get it in the jars to get cured and get it
into wherever it goes for storage before
[SPEAKER_00]: you even cut down the other batch you
could have a nice perpetual harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: without having one harvest at one time and
a perpetual grow all right this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: got shorter than I intended it for it to
be because I don't know what happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: that camera honestly you guys it's plugged
in everything should be rocking it flash
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit on the screen it went out no
excuses we're gonna make this work thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for watching um the next episode will
be better because this one was a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck big shout out to my buddy Dave
uh where are we if you have any questions
[SPEAKER_00]: corrections comments or concerns please
send me an email the email address is grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart at hotmail.com everything
else is on the website iregenetics.com I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna wrap it up because I don't want to
ramble if this isn't even recording guys
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for watching I love you every
day big shout out to my buddy Billy bong
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and until next time take a fat dab
and give your mom a hug for me you you you
