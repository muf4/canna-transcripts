[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Show Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 417 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds will be releasing the
first batch of Blue Raspberry Truffle on
[SPEAKER_00]: 420, so make sure you check them out at
OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a regular podcast listener,
you know that I like to start the show off
[SPEAKER_00]: by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a delicious dab of Malibu Pure
Kush Batter from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this has 67.8% THC and
80.4% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color and consistency of this batter
are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really light golden yellow color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a dollop of yellow frosting
right in the middle of this container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromas coming out of here are
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a hint of gassiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a hint of fuel, but also an
overwhelming scent of pine and kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a kush smoker, if you are into
the California kush flavors, the Malibu
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Kush Batter from Apothecary Farms is
a delicious treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of my friends at
Apothecary Farms for this delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to read a
couple of listener emails, but before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get there, I owe a couple of people some
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to my friend,
Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to Richard
Memel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a giant shout out to my friend,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout
out to Farmer John.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout
out to Ryan Schmidt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, a giant high five
and a shout out to my friend, Eric Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn, how to support
the show through Patreon, you can do so by
[SPEAKER_00]: going to Patreon.com slash Grow From Your
Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information that you need will
be right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to read listener emails
on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first email in this episode goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just listened to your episode on
determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a strain that has another week of
push before I flush the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scoped the trichomes and I noticed that
they are all amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure what sped up the ripening,
but the buds themselves are still pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the buds may be pushing,
but the main goal is to grow ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to harvest when the trichomes are
ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if those buds are still pushing,
if the trichomes are ready, it is time to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't harvest that plant,
those buds will keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it will grow itself to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't chop it down,
if you don't do something, the buds will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a possibility if you give the
plants the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say that the plants are done one
week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go on to say, I'm wondering what
environmental factor could have done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that could have
done it, but let's read further into this
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet we are going to get some hints and
some clues and maybe some tips as to what
[SPEAKER_00]: went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues and it goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some background on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a sulfur burner start fire on week
one into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is a good hint of what went
wrong in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few big leaves dried out and died.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canopy is 12 to 16 inches away from
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a 1000 watt HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room temps got into the 90s early into
flower as I'm running CO2 in late flower
[SPEAKER_00]: 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's saying it was 78 degrees in
late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the email by wishing me good
luck at an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, follow my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gives us his Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is Gallatin gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's G-A-L-L-A-T-I-N gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, thanks and signs his
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gallatin gardens from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about why your
plant may have finished itself a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to touch on again
is the goal is ripe trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said those plants are still
pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't matter if the buds are still
swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those trichomes are done, if you've got
20 to 30 percent amber trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is probably time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to quickly be 50 to 60
percent amber trichomes on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will not be as desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will miss your opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about reasons why this may
have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sulfur burner you talked about in
week one that did not help.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably not a major contributing
factor because it happened so early,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it certainly did not help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I would think about is it
probably got kind of warm in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said the temps got into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably wasn't helpful either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you were running CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can go a little hotter,
but you also had the lights 12 to 16
[SPEAKER_00]: inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have glass between the
bulbs and the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of reflectors have glass in the
middle there and they are air cooled so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're getting that heat away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your heat situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sounds like maybe those plants
got a little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you had the light too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not able to stick my hand in there and
feel what those plants feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't be afraid to put your hand
around your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe wear a glove when you do it so you
don't get all sticky, but just grab a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As your mom, when you're a little kid,
your mom ever touch, reach down and just
[SPEAKER_00]: touch your face and go, you're cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I'm cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants can't tell you when they're
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to grab them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an experienced grower,
you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they feel cold, they are cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to heat up the room a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same with warm plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when your mom used to reach down
and touch your forehead and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have a fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the same about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach down and touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they feel warm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they feel cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were the leaves getting taco shaped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any bleaching to the tips of
these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know a few more things and we
could help you dial in exactly what made
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants speed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm thinking they got a little bit
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were too close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sulfur burner certainly was not your
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming that since you had a
little bit of a heat issue and these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were probably too close to the
light, there was probably a poor VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vapor pressure deficit was probably
not ideal for these plants, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the ripening time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of stress may increase
ripening times in some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm going to assume that there were
swings in your day and night conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you had such a high daytime
temperature, I'm assuming that your
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime temperature probably dropped
fairly low and you were having a large
[SPEAKER_00]: swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have encouraged your plants to
speed up a little bit and finish sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: than you expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the CO2 probably helped them speed
up a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible that one of your nutrients
made these plants finish a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure what you fed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I am assuming on the vapor pressure
deficit situation and your diurnal swings,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the environment in your
room was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I'm assuming that since
you had high temperatures and you had
[SPEAKER_00]: issues before that you're probably having
other environmental issues and those may
[SPEAKER_00]: be contributing factors to why your plants
are finishing a little bit earlier than
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here is my main question that I
probably should have asked very first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you feel like the plants are
finishing a week ahead of schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: What gave you that schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the seeds come with a thing that says
these plants finish in eight to nine weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and you think they're eight to nine weeks
in and it's time to cut them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your friend say, hey, I ran this clone
in my room and it takes exactly 63 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to kind of know what gave you the
idea that these plants have the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time you think they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you experienced with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ran them before?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't ran them at least two times
before, you don't know them well enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that they are behind schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they change with the very
slightest changes in your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the very slightest changes in your
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very curious what gives you the
idea that these plants should be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific timeframe in which you have
decided.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doubting your grow knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doubting your skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wonder where this number came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that number came from a seed pack
and this is your first run, you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to let the plants do their
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not second guessing your
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got it from seed,
you need to let it go long enough to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about what the number on the
package says.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the ideal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get outliers that take
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get outliers that finish
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's from a seed pack, you've got to
be a little more flexible with your
[SPEAKER_00]: timeframes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the clone came from a friend and your
friend said that it takes a certain amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of time, who knows if your friend is a
good judge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what type of environment your
friend was using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he was running an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running an HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he was feeding a botanic care and
you're feeding it whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to assume what you're
feeding, but maybe a lot of things could
[SPEAKER_00]: have been different and a few different
things can make the plants finish a week
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier or a week later, just depending on
what you're doing in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain stresses can speed up ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stresses can slow down ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some environmental factors will make the
trichomes ripen more early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some environmental factors will make the
trichomes ripen later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened in your grow
room, but it sounds like you had quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: few stresses and they probably
contributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every one of them contributed a
small bit to these plants finishing sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: than you may have anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know how you have decided
that these plants should be done by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've grown them 20 times and you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your situation is,
but all of these small stressors seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: have added up to making these plants
finish earlier than you think they should
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say they are possibly in
panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that they are getting beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that they have had a lot of
problems and they're just looking for time
[SPEAKER_00]: to clock out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, is it done yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just ready to clock out and go
home and smoke a joint like we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about in a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're finishing up their life cycle
and they're just wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just ripening up so that you'll
cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just jot me down, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing we should consider that
I just thought about is foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you sprayed these plants with
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar sprays can mess up your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar sprays can mess up everything if
you do it too late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you foliar spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you say that you had that sulfur
burner catch on fire early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How late into flower did you run that
sulfur burner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you keep that going into week six into
week seven?
[SPEAKER_00]: That also could have done damage and sped
up the ripening of your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that may have sped up the
ripening of these plants is a reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did these plants start getting less light
than what they were used to?
[SPEAKER_00]: A light reduction could speed up the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants think that the end of season is
coming and they will speed up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a plant that won't finish in
the amount of time I want it to finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I will reduce the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go from 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start off with 11 on and 13 of dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes I'll go like 10 hours
on and 14 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really late in flower with some
really picky cultivars, I will have as
[SPEAKER_00]: little as eight hours of daylight and 16
hours of darkness each cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really speeds up those plants of
finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did these plants get a light reduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a bulb go out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a bulb going out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time to replace a bulb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an issue in the grow room to
where this plant got moved away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm very curious, where are you
checking the trichomes on the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes on the top of the plant,
trichomes in the middle of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the trichomes on the bottom are going
to be ripe at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to check the plant in
different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really not trying to sound like I'm
second guessing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just simply listing things that I
think may apply to your situation that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have not noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not trying to doubt your ability or
your skills as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You reached out with a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing my best to cover all of the
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main assumption is that your plants
finished earlier due to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stress was probably from the heat,
probably from the sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That CO2 probably did speed them up just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you fed them something that made
them ripen a little more early than you
[SPEAKER_00]: had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I wonder where you got this
arbitrary number of when they're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know if you've grown these
plants 20 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it is your second run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you got this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to adjust that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the plants were sprayed with
something that would have damaged the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my last suggestion, suspicion that I
would like to talk about is perhaps those
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of your bulbs is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps one of your ballasts is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're running a thousand watts and
you're not getting a thousand watts coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you need to invest in a lumen
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to borrow one from the grow
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just need to replace that bulb
and see if that was the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I am not in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have only got the information that you
sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sent a lot of great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you a lot of good advice in
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to thank you for the great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing about how this
crop came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the final product?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you let it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you cut it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you dry and cure it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it smoke when you got to test it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you going to do different in
your next grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks again for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I just got a text
message letting me know that my next
[SPEAKER_00]: appointment has been moved to an earlier
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a meeting that I need to get
