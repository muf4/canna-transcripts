[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 715 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to answer a few
grow questions before I get to that part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a few shout outs to a few of

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen and you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: do include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize if you hear my voice
getting raspy there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I did take a few
fat dabs today and they are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through one of those phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this occasionally on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious how your life is, how you
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's communicate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go through phases where you can
smoke a lot and you don't get blazed or
[SPEAKER_00]: some days you could smoke very little and
you get blazed all the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: The past two days, I could just smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like a fog machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like my job in my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My duty was to see how many grams of
concentrates I could put through my rig
[SPEAKER_00]: and through my lungs and I wasn't getting
blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just getting work done and I
couldn't fucking stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just smoking and smoking and my
brain was like, no, do more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not high yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just take more dabs and do more work
and I just didn't feel like I got blazed
[SPEAKER_00]: for like two straight days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I've been smoking the same
concentrates that I smoked for the past
[SPEAKER_00]: two days and today that first dab of today
that shit wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kicked my ass and every dab after
that has been beautiful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you go through phases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, like I said, sometimes I can
smoke all the dabs and I don't get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's some days when I can open
the jar and look at the dabs and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your body do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mine is attributed to a lot of his
hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I'm dehydrated, I'll get super
blazed super quickly and I cough more my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I eaten enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've had too much sugar, too much junk,
then maybe I don't get as blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes I'm just in the fucking
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain is like, dude, you're going to do
work today and nothing is going to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I ended up transplanting
everything cleaning everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain was on fire that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today anyway, I am going to be high
and rambly because the dabs are working
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're back in full effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to keep my high ass in focus on
track on some sort of path here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next note on my list is that I have
added the I read genetics merchandise
[SPEAKER_00]: store to my Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I figured out how to use Instagram as
a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the I read underscore
genetics, Instagram page, I read
[SPEAKER_00]: underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top there, there is a shop now or
visit the store button.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what it will say for your
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can click on the visit the shop is
what I think it should say since I added
[SPEAKER_00]: it edited it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on visit the shop and you'll
be able to buy hats and t shirts and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will take you to the web store
where you can find all of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise like stickers, trays,
grinders, a lot of stuff is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one more avenue for you to be able to
find the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already following the
Instagram, you're messing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Instagram is I read underscore
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I R I E really quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a lot of people call me eerie
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call me what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the word is I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read is a Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means to, uh, to feel as blessed as you
could feel is basically what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had a reggae show and you hear
him go, how are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crowd goes, I read it's cause
you're feeling I read, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as, uh, for me, I read is
like, uh, sitting on like the top of a
[SPEAKER_00]: grassy hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that cold feeling of like when the
sun is shining and the grass is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sitting in the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe you got a lady next to me,
maybe a dog on the other side of me,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe multiple dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, uh, the, the sun is just
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeze is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vibe is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a fat spliff burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries in the, in the, in my mind at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that little breeze, the grass,
your partner, whoever is with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're, if you're at whatever you're
into, if you're into f***** snakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: parrots, have some of them with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be surrounded by trolls and
monkeys, you can have those too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my mind, I got a pretty lady with
me, got a couple of dogs hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that is irie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just feeling, that's like as good
as you could feel, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything feels nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is irie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's the name of my seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my Instagram irie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what's better than just
feeling irie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means to feel blessed and powerful
and pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just that feeling of feeling
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the best that you could feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's bugging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So irie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're checking out the
Instagram is where I'm headed with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have added the Instagram store to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get an irie army t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your grow from your heart
podcast hats there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also every Monday I do an Instagram live
there on that exact irie genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram live feed Monday at seven 10 ish
PM mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at seven PM mountain time,
it's about seven 10, seven 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I try to get going about seven 10,
but sometimes, uh, the internet is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes Instagram fights me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a couple of tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll be there every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't missed a Monday in a really long
time years, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every Monday around seven 10,
we go live on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to music and I basically answer
the questions that are on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: People type in comments and I will answer
politely, uh, do my best to respond and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, answer all those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me on the Instagram for the
Instagram live, check out the Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a big thank you to the
people who helped me, uh, encouraged me to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the store up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the nudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the encouragement,
the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people were telling me that
I could get badges on Instagram live,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would allow me to monetize the
Instagram live, which would be cool
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of people in there and I do
freely answer grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask a question, I do my best to
answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I give golden nuggets that are
worth a million dollars and someone told
[SPEAKER_00]: me we could monetize it to where you could
give me a dollar or $5, uh, just by
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing a little button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Instagram denied and
rejected my application for those badges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to let you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give me no bonuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get none of that stuff,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still going to do the Instagram lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's not going to change
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still free information, free knowledge,
free hangouts, free vibes, free love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I do it for the love of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have notes because I told you,
I took dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got blazed, uh, added the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to the people that helped denied
badges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also follow the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re underscore genetics is the seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a bunch of flower pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you'll see that I use creative
hashtags to confuse Instagram so they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what I'm posting all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, there is a grow from your heart
podcast, Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use hashtag GF Y H podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will come into play in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do other things, if you're using
hashtag GF Y H podcast, it may help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you post anything podcast related,
please do use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which side is that going to be on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be turned around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be here or here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag GF Y H podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do both sides, I can't be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot of questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get to the, uh, the good part
of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is going to say the good part
actually starts around nine minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the free show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from the grow help tab on
the, I read genetics.com website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com has a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you go there, you will find a grow
help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on that, we do ask you one,
two, it's about 10 or 12 looking like
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you while you're strained,
where you're growing, what kind of whites,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some information so that I can help
diagnose the problems in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom of this questionnaire,
we do give you an opportunity to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or ask the question, which is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from the grow help tab
came from our friend, Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Adam wants us to call him Adam on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's growing several strains indoors under
led lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's grown in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about, um, we do need to know
pH of the last feeding six, four daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: sent temp 78 nighttime temp 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not give me the humidity and these
questions going to set that page aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a note on there I need for later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: To page two, the grow help question,
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it says here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cloning problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take my clones from healthy mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always water the day before cutting
clones and I'm always sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys clean up your cloning aerial when
you're taking clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, think of it as like, uh, if you got
your finger cut off, you could bring your
[SPEAKER_00]: finger to me and your hand and you could
throw them down on this table and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say, bro, can you stitch my finger
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could, but I've been taking dabs at
this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have eaten Thai food at this table
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This table may not be the cleanest place
for me to, uh, reattach your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want a more clean, sterile,
uh, sanitary type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that when you're cutting
clones, you're cutting their arms off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cutting their legs off and you're
trying to make them grow into fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend says, I always try to be
sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good practice to teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always cut clones in that clean sterile
environment, if and when possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: as clean as possible and you'll also use
clean, uh, sterile equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's getting a hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're passing around this virus and it
can move from plant to plant via your
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean your scissors all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now is something we should talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's like fucking plant COVID plant
AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll get somebody who's more qualified
to talk about hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honestly not qualified to talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a more qualified, uh, school
educated person for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smart enough, uh, not smart
enough, educated enough to come talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow I do, uh, got another microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our buddy, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have an at least 95% success
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is once my clone or my clones
always look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time they go into flower
and revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right there is a main key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a main hint that tells me that
they're not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, your light cycle is not on long
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they under 24 hours of light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your light on 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe get it closer, maybe get more
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want 24 hours of light to get these
clones go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know your light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not include that in the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any data to work with
there, but my first guess is more light,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, longer light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will do a podcast on DLI here
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into flower and revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time they go into flower and
revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them more light, they won't go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my leaves turn yellow and get
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is either overfeed, underfeed,
or improper humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't have a reading on your
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at this paper again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, I always get nice and healthy
roots, but it takes forever to get them to
[SPEAKER_00]: snap back and turn healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the same for mothers,
uh, that I cut from clone or from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use an oxycloner with Horne X or clone X
pH to 5.8 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your meter doesn't have an ish on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your meter puts out numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your number on the meter isn't 5.8 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the number on the meter,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you should have typed right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, uh, that's going to tell me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use a humidifier to keep the humidity
up in the 70% range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any pointers would be very appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you might, uh, what is the,
I want to know you can message me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there are things I want to know in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the, uh, the PPMs or the EC of the
solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the oxycloner, what else did you put in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a Horne X or clone X pH to 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's your EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your PPMs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that Horne X or clone X are
you putting in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then how hot is that water?
[SPEAKER_00]: That water could be getting too hot or
that water could be getting too cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: which doesn't sound likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause you're getting the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think you need more light and I
want to know what, how much of your
[SPEAKER_00]: solution you're using, but honestly,
I think the first thing I'm going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said there are very few people who are
vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going into flower and revenge,
which is a light issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed them properly and get them light
and make sure that the water in that
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner is nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 70% humidity range that's going to
help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, when I'm using the
cloners like that, humidity isn't super
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to be real high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more important to keep that water,
uh, pH and properly nutrient did keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're using an arrow cloner that's
bubbling constantly, or if it's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot, here's something you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got two things, two things of thought
to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's getting too hot, give it
downtime, let it turn off, let it bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: for 15 or for 50 minutes, maybe 45,
then give it 15 to 10 minutes off to cool
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I was going to say,
it's constantly bubbling or almost
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly bubbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting, uh, water through
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting air into the water,
which is going to create a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the water evaporates, the nutrients
that are salts do not evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those salts are still staying there in
your reservoir in the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, now your PPMs, your EC and your pH are
all going to fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to check that on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes on a twice daily basis,
depending on the size of the machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, your temperature, how much the,
how much your plants are eating,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how much water is being eaten,
how much is, uh, evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check that, check the pH, the EC,
the TDS of that water frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're setting it up and you're saying
it's at five, eight right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's legit on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but by day two, day three,
it's gone up or it's gone down some
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, check the, uh, the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those are things that I really think
will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a definitive answer because I
don't have, uh, enough definitive data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me more data and I will
again, respond and try to get you more
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to our friend, Adam,
for the great clone question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving because I do have
another great question here in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, hi Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is from our friend, Canadian Mike
big up to our friend, Canadian Mike up
[SPEAKER_00]: there, north of the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says big respect for all of your hard
work, your seeds, your breeding and your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it also says hopefully one day soon,
a drum solo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you do know that I'm a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you may know by now that I'm a
breeder and I do make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, you might not know that I'm a
drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played drums since I was 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm approaching 43 at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say that very often on the show,
but I've been playing the drums for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can read and write music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that a lot of people want me to
whip out a drum solo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are videos from 2008 on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, bro, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the respect and appreciation
and the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says first here's my setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only grow regular or regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tried autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an old hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really mess with the auto flowers
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a couple of reasons why I like
the regulars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, bet that's regs, uh, fems or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's photos is what we're trying to say
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why I like the photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, regs or fems don't matter to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can work with both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it says I've got quite a few four by
eight flower, veg, mother, clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling, mother and dry tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of pheno hunting in very small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a 750 liter nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nursery bags are about the size of a
solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I imagine when you said 750,
uh, point 750 liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did read that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it right, set it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then it says I use the paper towel
method for 24 to 48 hours until roots
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in Jiffy pucks, uh, with 24 to zero
hours of light, uh, 24 on zero off after
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days, uh, 1212 in the nursery bags
filled with cocoa, only a 400,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a photosynthetic photon flux
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up to 900 PPFD near the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: No CO2, Remo nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow 16 or 25 plants per four by four
square.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss those days, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you guys, I did go really fast
over a lot of those, uh, and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be important for some of the
questions that for the questions coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up, but some of you will understand and
appreciate those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, growing 16 to 25 plants per four by
four, depending on the strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the width, lanky branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cut most of the sides off to get
only a few most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we weren't limited by numbers here,
I would grow this style in my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow back in the day, allegedly,
uh, before I was known before I,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, was people knew who I was and what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have done stuff similar to this,
uh, in home grows and we may have crushed
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have been a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a great way to breed because you can
fit a lot of phenotypes in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see a lot of things and you can breed
a lot of things and it really speeds you
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing it so I can maximize real
estate and they have a full canopy like
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without a net, yes, I totally
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a sea of green instead of a
screen of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did throw out the letters of SOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he understands now it does say my
question and I've been rambling for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad we got to this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question since these are small
pots, they're 12 to 20 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get our plants that are 12 to 20
inches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get the full expression of the plant
regarding effects, aroma, and taste just
[SPEAKER_00]: like a normal veg and fully grown plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I only grow for the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest are just bonuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says big cheers from Canadian Mike,
Canadian Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big cheers back at you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this because this is how I like the
testers that I give out to be ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give a lot of test seeds out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people have been asking about
being testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, by the way, if you want to be a
tester, there is an episode of this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow from your heart podcast is titled
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've listened to that, then follow
the appropriate steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you'll have to send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also be required and requested to
join my discord server and join the tester
[SPEAKER_00]: tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already testing for me and
you're not posting pictures in the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: tester tab, please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get more test seeds in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's where all of the testing will
be kept and done and journaled and
[SPEAKER_00]: documented and highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that is how I like to do the
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like small plants, uh, because why are
we going to run gigantic plants if we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if they're any good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you're saying, um, I don't think
we need big ass plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're asking if we're going to see the
full expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I have grown, um,
so I've grown a lot of plants in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I test brand new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I just made, let's say I just
made a brand new batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to grow it in a 10 gallon pot
and get it fucking 10 feet tall and spend
[SPEAKER_00]: six months on it to find out that it's a
male or it's intersex or it's trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow a bunch of plants in small
pots in a small space, just like this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do I had a tray that would hold
24 cups beautifully, 2428 doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds them perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once I got the tray out and set it up,
I would remember quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 24 could fit 24 cups in this
tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could fit two of those under a light
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 48 seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would veg them tiny flower them out,
see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would keep the best out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would revedge those and grow them again,
or I just let them go and re redo more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I have done is I've grown the
same thing in little cups and in big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen the, uh, similar results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show you the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, in my experience,
what I've noticed and what other growers
[SPEAKER_00]: will probably agree with those big giant
plants become more problematic,
[SPEAKER_00]: more prone to problems, more prone to pre
more prone to pass pathogens, diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to prop them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start falling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they get more problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller, younger plants, you don't get
as much time to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less time you're on the road,
the longer you have to crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go faster, get to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back on my notes because I
do have notes written here in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, you will see that full
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hormones are going to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things are going to happen just like
they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'll see those plants in my
experience, the small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were going to enter a competition for
buds to see who grows the best buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: photogenic wise, flavor, aroma,
potency, overall cannabis cup winning
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not grow giant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow small to medium sized plants
and I'd grow several of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the way I would prefer to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like they spend less energy on
growing, uh, less energy on supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves on beefing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've got so much energy already in
that small ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do provide light and all that shit,
but I mean, like, I just think they have
[SPEAKER_00]: more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They focus more on bud development,
potency, flavor, the things that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're not trying to make them
gigantic and make them support themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and be branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think they're better,
smaller, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my honest opinion, my experience,
I would prefer smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know that I would always go
with the tiny nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go, uh, just the one step above
that, like a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your plants are making you happy,
uh, it sounds like you're doing a great
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells, it sounds like you're a great
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got the right idea in the
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think if you're growing them
properly, giving them their love and care,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mentioning how much PPFD you're
giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume with that many details in
this note that your plants are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: very close to their maximum potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you'll learn more very quickly
because I could tell that you are a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, curious and intelligent person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big cheers, my friend, Canadian Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor and a pleasure to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to future correspondence
with you, my friend, because that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: great question.

boys and girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
and pollen chukers, all of you beautiful
