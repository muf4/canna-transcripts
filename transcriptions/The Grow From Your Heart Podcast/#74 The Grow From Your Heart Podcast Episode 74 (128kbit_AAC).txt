[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 73,
73, 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be 74 of the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast, your source for cannabis news,
[SPEAKER_02]: education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting across the table from me is my
good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give you a big personal thank
you before we start the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: My car has been broke down, like you guys
all know, and Mike was kind enough to run
[SPEAKER_02]: my errands for me today, and he actually
stopped at the donut shop on the way home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all hopped up on donuts and
caffeine right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, dude, for hooking me up with a
ride lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, while we're giving thanks,
I got to give a thanks to the Mystic Roots
[SPEAKER_02]: band.
[SPEAKER_02]: That song that I cut off abruptly there
was the Doggy Dub from the Mystic Roots
[SPEAKER_02]: off their album, The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Kat Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that they let me play their music
on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really super kind of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a shout out to my buddy Deez.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working on a new intro song for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big thanks to Deez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I were talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have anything to do on a
Saturday night because we're a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: bums, and we're like, why don't we do
something productive and record a podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some time to good use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, put our time to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put our sugar to good use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be bouncing off the walls
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Amy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Amy's Donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Amy's Donuts in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whoever was the one sad, lonely guy
working the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to make you laugh, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't going to stop and get donuts,
but as we drove by, we could see into the
[SPEAKER_02]: building that there was just one dude
standing there staring out the window,
[SPEAKER_02]: watching traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I predicted that if we waited four
hours without going, he may kill himself
[SPEAKER_02]: standing there staring out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked so sad and lonely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had to go cheer him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought some donuts and Mike gave the
dude a fat tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nice of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fat for Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a donut tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I handed it to him, it was kind of
clear that he did not expect to get tipped
[SPEAKER_01]: on this shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then now he's got money for whatever
he does after work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's at least got a story to tell at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two super high guys came through and
bought a lot of donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the directions were to fill the
box with something, quote, colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I want one of these specific
donuts because they're tasty as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, just put colorful
shit in the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he met that goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking forward to eating the lime
green, possibly apple flavored one later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of them got marshmallow on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really try to stay away from the
marshmallow products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, he didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I've had a lot of sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about donuts for almost
three minutes now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are no ads on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to read some news.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day I told Mike, he was talking
about news.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I tweeted you some good news
and no, not necessarily good news,
[SPEAKER_02]: good news articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all good news, but he tweeted
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, you can go ahead and use
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, why don't you go
ahead and be like my news guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you send me all the news about
cannabis that you can find?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way I can work on the grow
lessons and we can get Mike doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: news for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have to read all the news and
review it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mike's searching out the news a little
more for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to keep doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to keep the people informed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have time to do this show's news,
the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: My focus on what you do best, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got their wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having you do some news is fully part
of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely going to make it a little bit
of an improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you get bored on the news shows,
I apologize, but I think it's just as
[SPEAKER_02]: important as the lessons and things and
tweeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of us tell us you want more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you find a news article you want me
to read, you can tweet it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's find one of these news
articles we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready for this, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with let's start with Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you done now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's usually some fucked up shit we
hear about from Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one doesn't involve a goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not involve a chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: No face eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: No bath salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually this is a step in the
right direction for Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida is going the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I've got a giant slide on my
screen right in the way here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did that article go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to refresh because this
website I'm using is filled with ads that
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot find the article under.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually some good news coming out
of Florida this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scrolling to the article right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the headline is Florida low THC
medical marijuana law passes major hurdle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you guys kind of know where this
is headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, this is actually from the
first coast news.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to give them credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, we've shared their emotional
stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents from all over the state have been
waiting, waiting to get their hands on
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte's web, a low THC form of medical
marijuana to treat illnesses their
[SPEAKER_02]: children have such as epilepsy,
seizures and cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says from Tallahassee, Florida,
we've shared their emotional stories
[SPEAKER_02]: parents from all over the state have been
waiting, waiting to get their hands on
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte's web, a low THC form of medical
marijuana to treat illnesses and their
[SPEAKER_02]: children such as epilepsy, seizures and
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now finally, on Wednesday,
they got an answer when a judge threw out
[SPEAKER_02]: a lawsuit holding up the implementation of
the drug, Jeff Sharkey started the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana business association.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's followed the entire process of
Charlotte's web from lawmakers legalizing
[SPEAKER_02]: it last year to several other lawsuits,
including those that are being filed.
[SPEAKER_02]: lawsuits from potential growers,
halting the sale of the drug to today with
[SPEAKER_02]: a sale date in sight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rule that was finally approved was
fair and balanced, Sharkey said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long discussion and dialogue
and I know there's been some frustration
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, but here we are with a rule
that's going into effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys, I'm trying to cough and read
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have people submitting applications
to become dispensaries and I think Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: is ready for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida's Department of Health has been
the agency in charge of implementing
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're expected to take applications from
eligible growers within three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the law, only five will be chosen to
sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty soon in Florida, there will be
five dispensaries selling Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have mixed emotions about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you, Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you got shit to say already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel a little bad because I
didn't follow this story as closely as I
[SPEAKER_01]: follow most cannabis news because it's
another Charlotte's Web state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while any progress towards medical
marijuana access is huge and awesome and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's another big win for reality and
science, CBD only is silly and it's a half
[SPEAKER_01]: step that no one needs to take at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: California has been medical since 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this CBD stuff and Charlotte's Web
came out of our medical marijuana system
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to the vote last year in
Florida, they've got CBD only now thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: to this law, but it's only Charlotte's Web
specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only strain they can sell and
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realm of Caring did an amazing job
trademarking and getting their name out
[SPEAKER_01]: and pitching it as safe and not
intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add that and Sanjay Gupta together and
we've got 13 CBD only states.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I said I had mixed emotions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my opinions is like you said,
it's great that we have medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: in Florida now so that these kids can get
their medicine and the parents don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to watch their children suffer and the
kids can live a happy normal life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that CBD only medicine
is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, like you're saying, this one
company that owns the Charlotte's Web is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make money off of this like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a cool way to go about
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, if you really think about
it, the article talks about the kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not just children in Florida that
would be accessing Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_01]: medications through these five
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all the adult patients with all of
those conditions as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about a huge number of
people, five store locations, one product
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to run out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be huge product
limitations and it's going to be like two
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous cost per gram like it is out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the price off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost threw out a random number,
but I don't want to do that because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculously high, but I don't want to be
wrong about how ridiculously high.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'll let you live with that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so there's something that Mike
said that the THC is good medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something I feel about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to call it the entourage effect in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the industry term has moved to the
synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the effect of the cannabinoids,
the palliates, the terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavonoids and the estrogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all working together to provide you a
medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just by isolating the CBD,
I don't think you're getting the full
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit of the medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to say it works with the
kids and the kids don't have seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, CBD medicine doesn't do
anything for my medical condition that I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great for me, but it doesn't do
everything I need it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the THC half of that puzzle as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mike, we see this with the there's a
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent THC pill called Marinol
on the market for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one likes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody likes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have the rest of the
cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried to see that balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to see that of X.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just called it sativa X.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's one company in Europe
that's doing a whole plant extract where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're taking the whole raw marijuana
plant and making some sort of I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a sublingual spray is spread under your
tongue like Benaka.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were testing it for MS the last I
read.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are companies looking at whole
marijuana plant extract rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: isolating one or two components.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does your friend, Dave, listen to the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea he should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you do, bro, shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought of you and he said that we've
got a friend that could benefit from this
[SPEAKER_02]: sublingual spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sublingual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just spat that one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to work for a lot of
people, but I'm a medical smoker and I
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely need my THC heavy sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out for going the right
direction, Florida, for trying to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this will open the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do they have to just go with CBD
medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the end of what they have going
for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's another group working
towards getting legalization on the ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: in Florida, either medical or rec again in
the next presidential.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess we can look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, excuse me, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had sugary Dr. Pepper and donuts and my
voice is already all fucked up from the
[SPEAKER_02]: show, but we can look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sick kids who have seizures and
epilepsy and cancer and things like that
[SPEAKER_02]: that need help can now get the CBD
medicine and the people like you and I
[SPEAKER_02]: that are in our thirties that know some
people that know some people that aren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're able bodied.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go out and get some herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kids, those kids needed it way more
than the folks that want the sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps a lot still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan, but at the same time,
I remember how many epilepsy patients used
[SPEAKER_01]: to come into the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember them enough to have
researched some of this stuff after we
[SPEAKER_01]: left and THC is fairly effective on
treating seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having some THC in an anti-seizure
medication that's made from cannabis makes
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole lot of sense in Charlotte's web
specific laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't end up with Charlotte's web
because it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw it working great for seizures and
dove into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found it had no THC and that certain
medical patients were looking for a non
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxicating medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're afraid to give the THC to the
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big scary part here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a much better pitch when there's
absolutely no THC in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you can just say straight up,
there's no high to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no intoxicating effect,
but an intoxicating effect doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: non medical effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means also intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get out of Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a couple of minutes on that
news topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to bore the folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was big in the news this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is going to remain big in the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for the next little while,
what's the next, this is a random
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the next cannabinoid to pop up?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping it's CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the good fortune to get a small
sample of CBG capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was during a period of time where I had
some bad back pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Lordy, they helped me get through some
long shifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did those come from within our circle?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made me sleep like a baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I need some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been having some sleep issues lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking too much sativa and
taking the alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more reason to get caregivers back
into the testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking about this alpha brain
and when I take it too late in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gives me the most craziest dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did an article from Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's jump to our hometown here in the
lovely steel city, Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_02]: 719.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline here is, Pueblo County wants
to keep excess weed money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This article is by Jeff Tucker from the
Pueblo Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Pueblo County will be asking
voters whether they want the equivalent of
[SPEAKER_02]: about three spins of the city park kiddies
ride, or if they would rather let the
[SPEAKER_02]: government use a little less than $150,000
in excess marijuana revenues for something
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, they're not from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a local joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a park here with some kiddie
rides.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs like 50 cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that they're going to write
a check for about three spins on those
[SPEAKER_02]: shitty rides, or if they'd rather let the
city just keep the money in the excess
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana revenues and use it for
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, the Pueblo Board of County
Commissioners instructed County Attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg Steidar on Wednesday to start work on
a ballot language that will give voters an
[SPEAKER_02]: option on what to do with the marijuana
sales tax money they collected in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: As part of the exemption, the 3.5% sales
tax from the State Taxpayers Bill of
[SPEAKER_02]: Rights, let's make sure I read that right,
3.5% sales tax from the State Taxpayers
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill of Rights, the county made an
estimated income of $400,000 from the
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana sales tax collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first year of legal recreational
sales in Pueblo County, $548,479 was
[SPEAKER_02]: collected from sales tax, meaning that
$148,000 and $479 is due back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: public unless voters give the county
approval to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let them keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they can fill some of the damn
potholes that are all over this city
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny that you say that the county
raked in a huge amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 1.7 million just in Pueblo
County last year from the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of that was taxes, half of that was
fees and application fees and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Pueblo West Metropolitan District
whined that all the shops were there but
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't getting a special cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the county commissioners broke them off
like 200 or 300 grand and they're throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: it all onto their streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they need their streets repaired as
badly as we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a good argument, the shops are
all here, we want a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the county said, here's your cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, thanks for the road money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it an extra shitty winter or are the
roads just not getting paid attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: because they've been terrible here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the cited issues I caught down at
city council is our roads right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get them up to speed at the pace we're
doing just to get the Pueblo stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: order is going to take 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how bad our infrastructure stuff is
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not just Pueblo, that's all
over the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why bridges are collapsing and
trains are crashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to invest in infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather have not heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the big reasons to vote this
year, and make sure you're registered to
[SPEAKER_01]: vote for this November election is if
you're in Colorado, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: half a dozen marijuana questions,
almost all of which are your state asking
[SPEAKER_01]: if they can keep the extra tax revenue
they collected last year, your county
[SPEAKER_01]: asking the same question, your city asking
the same question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get registered to vote, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Register to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, in the future, Mike is going to
come do an episode for us all about how to
[SPEAKER_02]: get yourself into politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're ready to lobby for cannabis or
anything else, Mike is going to come teach
[SPEAKER_02]: us a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put him on the spot now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just looked at me like, shit,
now I really have to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be a quickie, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just teach my friends that are listening
how to get into politics, how to get
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves started, get them going to
council meetings and shaking hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike will get you on the right track.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was our article from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how long we've been recording
before we jump in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some time left.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could definitely go for a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, well, your options are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This torobora that was grown by myself and
extracted by our good friends at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from our good friends over at
Terpex, Terpy Boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, fellas?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I picked this up over at the Green and
Healthy Wellness in lovely Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a week or two ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice guys, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to John John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great fellas.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Randalls Jr. What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some Durban Poison on the Sativa
end of things and we've got some 818
[SPEAKER_02]: headband, which in my opinion is more on
the indica side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm on getting dug with high
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's poison time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for the poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to get sued if I do that
too much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what, 15 seconds?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are rules around that and I read
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as I'm not making money,
it's cool if nobody gets mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they get offended, they can make me
take it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really it's like a fair use act law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just talking out of my ass kind of
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember exactly what I read,
but you can and can't at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's up to whoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get permission, then I can use
whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the songs I use in the intros and
outros, Mystic Roots Band has given me
[SPEAKER_02]: full permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Nickatee has given me permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally just tried to stab the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike held up the rig and you're not,
I don't know if that was your second time
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it or if you're the second person,
but he put his mouth full on to the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone and tried to dab through the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to put the dab on the nail and for
some reason put my face on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was going to do anything for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the process happen in your brain and
it was fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start reading this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember what the hell I was
saying anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feds tell their employees to stay away
from marijuana, even in states that have
[SPEAKER_02]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a federal agent, shout out to
Terpy boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the Terpy crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get them back on the
podcast again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have my car back here within the next
few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be able to go do a podcast with
the Terpy boy crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the cannabis grand crew that
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's happening as we record right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we were there, but I was not
prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this article, if you're a mailman,
what a mail person, we shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_02]: mailman because they're a female mail
carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a mail carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, is this a state park people,
if you work for the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal government, it's a huge number of
people, IRS, FBI, IRS can't smoke weed no
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to crunch numbers like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's read the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government wants to clear with
its federal employees that it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that might live in states that have
reformed their marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana remains illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't use it in guidance issued this
week from Katherine Archuleta,
[SPEAKER_02]: director of the U S office of personal
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's personnel management to the heads
of all federal departments and agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Archuleta says in no uncertain terms that
marijuana use for the more than 4.1
[SPEAKER_02]: million federal employees across the
nation is banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a shocker.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about, man, people need to smoke
their medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what makes you feel better,
you need to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feds don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds have no heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: High level of abuse, no medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feds have no heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Federal law on marijuana remains
unchanged.
[SPEAKER_02]: She writes in a letter announcing the
guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got four legal states, 30 some
medical states, 23 medical states,
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 CBD only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not one of them came with worker
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take any other intoxicating
medication you feel like or are prescribed
[SPEAKER_01]: or your doctor recommends, but not
cannabis, not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who's who?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we go about writing the worker
protection rules?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably not going to happen in our
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your new job, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your new calling in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's got to pay me for that amount of
lobbying.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, there's click the donate
button.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a donate button and you you write
Mike on there and then Mike will use that
[SPEAKER_01]: transmissions done getting paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, don't remind me transfer that
over to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't remind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mike, just he's not even reading the
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just said, well, four states have
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just read part of the article out of
your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So federal employees are also part of the
Drug Free Workplace Act guidelines,
[SPEAKER_02]: which ban any use of illegal drugs on and
off duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, most of the routine drug
testing of federal employees primarily
[SPEAKER_02]: occurs within federal agencies that have
personnel with safety sensitive jobs like
[SPEAKER_02]: those working in law enforcement or
national security.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a good time to mention to
those of you living in not Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about moving to heaven and for
our wonderful we laws that have a job when
[SPEAKER_01]: you get here because they're going to drug
test just like the one in Minneapolis or
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever you're flying from Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had a friend that had to pass a
drug test yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, she's like, how do I do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't know if they if I have to
take a P test, I don't even want to work
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do that back before Dabsworth
thing and Dabsworth thing for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've probably forgotten exactly how to
do that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: My way of doing it is the only way I can
do it is use fake piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only way I've ever been able to
pass a P test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go buy that fake pee and keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took breaks and just I was just be
sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never that painful.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time, dude, I went sixty three days
without smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to try to tell the drug test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's like, you had to have smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I went to Reggae on
the Rocks with my brother Bradley and
[SPEAKER_02]: rolled down the windows when he puffed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did not puff at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was laughing at me and I still failed
the P test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a fed in any way,
who else is a fed?
[SPEAKER_02]: We always said mailman's park rangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it applies to all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of different professions,
I suppose is the easiest way to say it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have rules that the feds get to lay
out regulations that the feds get to lay
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it comes with tax breaks if
and one of those is almost always drug
[SPEAKER_01]: free workplace act, which is why shit like
McDonald's drug test like mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all going to be kiosks pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That article actually came from the
Huffington Post by a dude named Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me read your article
there, Matt Ferner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably get in one more article here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to make it a good one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got about five minutes before I
want to start wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's going to be long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap this up with a funny one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we talked a whole bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you made it to the 30 minute mark on
this show, here is something for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hanging in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is good, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, and where is this from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Pendleton, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, man asks city to ban fart
smells for a good reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this came from the Huffington Post.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's written by Hillary Henson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to like this also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says a resident of Pendleton,
Oregon has written a letter requesting the
[SPEAKER_02]: city council ban the smell of farts in the
community, but he has good reason to be
[SPEAKER_02]: raising a stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, the city of Pendleton uploaded
its nuisance ordinance to cover the smell
[SPEAKER_02]: of marijuana, NBC reported at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that even though recreational
marijuana will be legal in Oregon starting
[SPEAKER_02]: in July, a person can be fined up to $500
if someone complains they smell marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from that person's property.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a letter published in the East Orgonian
on Thursday, someone who signed his name
[SPEAKER_02]: as Peter Walters merely asked that council
members take the next logical step and
[SPEAKER_02]: start regulating a far more noxious sin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was with great relief Thursday when I
read the East Coast of the East Oregonian
[SPEAKER_02]: that Pendleton city council took the time
to pass an amendment to the city's
[SPEAKER_02]: nuisance order, banning marijuana order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly there has been no issue of greater
importance facing the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that this important work has been
completed, I hope the council will move on
[SPEAKER_02]: to restricting the other offensive smell
that plagues our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walters, who is pretty clearly mocking the
marijuana ordinances, notes some habitual
[SPEAKER_02]: farters argue that they need to fart for
medical reasons, but that doesn't mean my
[SPEAKER_02]: kids should have to smell their farts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an elected official and you
behave absurdly, people have the right to
[SPEAKER_01]: mock the living shit out of you by sending
you public letters asking you to ban the
[SPEAKER_01]: smell of farts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo, last summer we passed a smell
ordinance down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's considered automatically a yes,
that's definitely offensive thing if your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor whines about the smell of your
pot garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be smoking marijuana on your porch
and that smell cannot be considered
[SPEAKER_01]: automatically offensive, but growing
marijuana is automatically offensive by
[SPEAKER_01]: city ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only odor that you can get in
trouble for in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if this passes, I pretty much can't
go to Pendleton, Oregon.
Ban.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be fined 500 bucks every couple of
minutes out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a farting fool on some days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's this vegetarian diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what do it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty soon you guys in Pendleton,
Oregon, they're going to ban farts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, but I think that's a great way
to respond to some dip shit ordinances
[SPEAKER_02]: made by some dip shit people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the guy who signed his
name as Peter Walters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're one of my heroes today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've gone 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some more news, but we're going
to save that for another episode because
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys really like these 30 minute
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Mike, thanks for hanging out with me
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for recording a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for kind of being my chauffeur.
[SPEAKER_02]: That little Ford Focus is killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to get you a better stereo in
there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole car is from 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not the car, it's what the
radio plays around here makes me want to
[SPEAKER_02]: stab my ears with fucking butter knives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear Channel's taken over the world and
I've been pushed back to FM recently and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been a tough transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I heard Taylor Swift,
Poison, Metallica, and I think it was some
[SPEAKER_02]: Bon Jovi on the way over here just as you
channel surfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were in the car for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got fucking bad people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God the digital age came along when
it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be so glad to get my car back and
then we'll get everything back together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all the people that have
helped me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of people that have
really given me some rides and shit for
[SPEAKER_02]: the past few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done me some favors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the people that have showed
up at my house with food because I hate
[SPEAKER_02]: eating food that I have at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cook the same shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of people that have
showed up with some fatty meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to be a homebound vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all my shit's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't stock the fridge for more than
three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can get a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a shit ton of bananas and apples
and I've been eating all kinds of goodies,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to the people that have helped
me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap up a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, remind these people how they can
follow you on Twitter one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.

Kevin Sebette for you.
