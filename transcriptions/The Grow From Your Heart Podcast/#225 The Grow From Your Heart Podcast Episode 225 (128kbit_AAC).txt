[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends and the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Pooh, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I just took a giant
dab of some Lemon Jeffery high cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dunked that into the Lemon Jeffery high
terpene full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just taking a dab, everything was going
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right toward the end of the dab,
I just started fucking sneezing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sneezed about 12 times in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke came out of my ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke came out of my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the smoke came out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was kind of not pleasant for a
couple of seconds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face feels all swollen and puffy like
after you sneeze a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good side is, I feel super
medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head is very mellow after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a fun intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a good 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not give your mom a hug for me
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get this podcast on the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it has been hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've been dealing with the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything's been going well in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the air conditioner is holding up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your brain hasn't melted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're staying hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to any festivals or
anything, stay hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were at Chalice, I hope you
survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big ups if you survived Chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chalice was a festival, a hash music and
art festival hosted by our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out in a northern part of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say Oxnard, but I could be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was seeing people posting pictures of
110, 112, and I think somebody posted 118
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were out there smoking hash and
watching music and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better people than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go play when it's 118
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I want to do is turn on the air
conditioner and stay the fuck inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to mess around with 118.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not sound like a good idea at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super pale.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, when I go out in the sun,
I'm almost gingery.
[SPEAKER_00]: My beard comes in red, but my hair is
blonde.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I go out in the sun, I just burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just roast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn bright red, and then I'll peel
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day, I'm not even a
suntan anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get a suntan or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go from white to lobster red to
peel to nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already off to a good ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a little bit of a breeding
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about the breeding project
I'm currently working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know anything about me,
you know I'm working with an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a golden goat female pollinated
by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise progeny has tested in the high
20s and low 30s in THC very consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Organtica in
New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, they have tested the highest I've
ever seen it test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tested at 35% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the highest that I've ever seen
steep hill test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big love to our friends at Organtica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using a male from the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named him King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: On June 18th, I used King Solomon to
pollinate a redheaded stranger,
[SPEAKER_00]: a protagium from Ethos Genetics,
a Flo, Kalonji Kush, Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Hellzog in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lemon skunk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capelten, Chefzog, White Widow,
Platinum Tangi, Chem 4, Jack Flash,
[SPEAKER_00]: Critical Mass, and a whole bunch of other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I pollinated them on the 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today it is, let's look down and see what
the date is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is 7-13 as I record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means they were pollinated almost
a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the seeds in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any sort of assistance to
see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are swollen up with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be done somewhere between two
and four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to let them go the full
four weeks to make sure that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with letting seeds go too
long is sometimes they get a little too
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and they don't germinate well.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these that are being made out of
this batch are going to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got plenty of other things that are
available for market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's where this breeding
project is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, something, I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited about the Platinum
Tangi to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put that orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I've been watching it happen,
the Chem 4 Arise combination has just been
[SPEAKER_00]: making me more and more excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm growing the Chem 4 in the
commercial grow at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gets huge and chunky and
stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been getting me excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about the Arise to Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's going to be a lot of cool new
shit coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are getting huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them in there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not quite turning dark yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're white and they're going kind of
grayish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go white and then kind of this
grayish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll turn to green and they'll
start turning that tiger stripe thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of doing the first transition
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost starting to be like real
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an update on the breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for paying attention to the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, huge thanks to everybody who have
been sending me strain name ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on new strains all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of new strains that could
use names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those strains have been Flow, Cross to the
Arise, and of course, White Widow,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been sending in names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've decided the name for Flow to
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Widow to Arise does not have a name
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any suggestions,
I'd love to hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tweet me at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey__genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, huge thank you to everybody who
contributed to the Patreon in the past and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This month was a great month for Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what Patreon is,
let me explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a service that allows you as a
listener to financially contribute to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks of your time, you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: to patreon.com slash
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can learn how to sign up to
contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging for money, but if you feel
like the show was worth a couple of bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love it if you threw them my
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will do with those couple of
dollars is I will keep my website up that
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is ireygeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like shit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus more on the podcast and more on my
grows than I do the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is the podcast or the
webpage is where the podcast is hosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to keep the webpage alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the podcast goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into an RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it ends up in iTunes and Stitcher so
that you're able to listen to it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm asking for is help in covering the
cost of my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also buy these little phone microphone
covers for when people come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a few other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy water bottles for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also dab everybody the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just looking for a little financial
help for the things that I've spent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast so it doesn't all come out of my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys can't contribute, I will
continue to do it out of my pocket because
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cannabis and I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn how to contribute,
simply go to patreon.com slash grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart and Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N,
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, huge thank you to
everybody who has contributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't contribute, don't feel
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want you to listen to this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are just a few people out there that
have asked how they can help out and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, moving forward, I've got a
little teaser.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was contacted by a company called PL
Grow and they are going to send us a
[SPEAKER_00]: product to review on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product is coming all the way from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little while,
but I am excited to get the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to test it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm even more excited to get
behind the microphone and tell you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: all about what these people sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at PL
Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really look forward to the box from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to press
pause here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's already doing that thing where
it sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I'm going to take a couple
of gigantic dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be right back and we're
going to read some emails from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first email is going to be about
trellising a commercial grow in a
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have another email that goes
right along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stick around, take a couple of dabs and
I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab of some,
what was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was strawberry icy ambrosia from our
friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up to Apothecary on ambrosia days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see some cool glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at the Glass
Grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Logan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me watch you blow
glass, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it was a hundred degrees that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super sunshiney and dude had a
tent, a little booth set up with two
[SPEAKER_00]: torches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were actually two Elevate had a
booth there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally these guys would fire up
their torches and blow glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't even go near the damn booth
when they were working the glass because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the glass workers who
were doing glass in the fucking heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a tougher man than me and woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a woman glass blower also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mad respect for the people out there in
the fucking heat working behind a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I went to the ambrosia days
on, it was 7-9, the day before 7-10,
[SPEAKER_00]: we picked up some pretty stylish hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some, I think one of my favorites
was honestly this Strawberry Icy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pleasantly surprised by some
Killer Queen Ambrosia and also the High
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Clementine, the Ambrosia and
also some Clementine Terps and some
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was some High Cannabinoid
Full Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of great stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've honestly been sitting on a bunch of
this Lemon Jeffrey High Cannabinoid Full
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been saving it for 7-10 and I've got one
gram of it left and I don't want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next things I'll be smoking,
I'm going to finish this Strawberry Icy
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambrosia and this Killer Queen High
Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract probably
[SPEAKER_00]: by the end of tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be out of all my 7-10 fancy
goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on Apothecary, have another sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go back up there and get
myself some more goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Cooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Coop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you up there at the Ambrosia days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coop had a little, a little surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to hear your taint is doing
well, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got weird super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I said taint, I regretted it,
but I'm not going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward and work on some
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of great emails
from listeners and I love doing shows
[SPEAKER_00]: based on listener content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets me know that I'm hitting my
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me know I'm helping at least one
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a question or if you need
some guidance on a grow or want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: something about cannabis, I would love the
opportunity to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I
will read your email on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people have sent me emails
and they're going to say, what the hell,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent you a message a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still haven't read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm working my way through it
and I'm getting caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I bought the printer and I've
been printing out the messages,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your chances are getting much higher
that your message will be read on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with this one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a person who calls
themselves Aaron and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use my name, the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently found your podcast and is now
part of my daily work routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually work on a commercial rec grow
in Oregon and introduced it to a few of my
[SPEAKER_00]: coworkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when people share the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully those people listen and then
hopefully they share it with somebody else
[SPEAKER_00]: and the podcast grows and grows and grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, now onto the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch, but we'll only throw a
few at you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I look forward to the other
questions, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you've got more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear them, so shoot them my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say recently you talked about
doing a Scrog, a screen of green in your
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you work that into a perpetual
cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm having issues with russet mites
and root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to get rid of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more organic, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you also point me in the direction
of where to find a grow Kashi bucket or
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Much thanks from Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first question is how do you work
that screen of green into a perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how you're doing the
perpetual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I do it in the grow at three
rivers is we've got three separate rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: that are used for flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we veg in one room and then we move the
plants to the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to leave them in the flower
room for about a week before I flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day they get moved into the flower
room, they get trellised.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get Scrog out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the screen up the minute those
plants are done being moved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're in there, we just start
Scrogging and then we put the,
[SPEAKER_00]: we put the Scrog kind of low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we honestly lower the plants anywhere
from four to six inches lower than what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were with that first Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bring them down right away,
spread them apart, spread them apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: lower them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we're doing it is we're doing
the whole room at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's making it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move it all into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we Scrog it on day one and pull it
all down and let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we flip it a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about two, maybe three weeks
after that we throw on the second net.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes two or three weeks
after that we throw on a third net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically how we're able to do
it in a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing more than one phase in a
tray or one area, it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you learn how to never cut the
screen down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we harvest, we cut the screen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything just comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to use something a little
more rigid than a net.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell plastic screens that you can use
or chicken wire or something so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can manipulate the plants through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you harvest one section,
you don't have to cut the net down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's going to be a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way, I can't say the only because
there are always options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it works for us is by doing whole
sections or whole rooms at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a tray, like an eight by
four tray, I wouldn't try to do one side
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 days ahead of the other and try to
Scrog it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to fucking suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get another tray or I would just
do a bigger room and I would do two
[SPEAKER_00]: separate sections for Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want two five by five tables
instead of one five by 10 or four by two
[SPEAKER_00]: four by fours instead of one four by eight
to Scrog like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be easier in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that we do it for a perpetual
cycle is I move them into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Scrog them that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They veg for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they flip about two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another net.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first net of Scrog is to spread them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that net on there and I just pull
them down and I double their width and I
[SPEAKER_00]: lower them by about four to six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just put your arms straight up
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine if somebody just grabbed your
arms and pulled them down and made a Y and
[SPEAKER_00]: made your Y wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give them go from a Y to a T and now
they start growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you turn your wrists up and
that's what they start doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just start shooting up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week two they need a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second trellis is just to support the
buds because now the buds are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to give them a little support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of hold them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third one is for those giant
donkey dick buds to just start flopping
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just put that third trellis in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow stuff like Jack Flash,
Kim For, Bordello, Blueberry Headband,
[SPEAKER_00]: those things all require a third trellis
if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I rambled on enough to answer that
part of your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the second part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're having issues with russet mites and
root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you do to get rid of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more organic, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites are a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites can destroy your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you sent this July 11th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully these things haven't eaten your
whole crop yet because they fucking have
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites are a real pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your pesticides that are allowed
by the marijuana enforcement division in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado won't be strong enough to take
down some russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're allowed to use in
Oregon, but one thing that I was told
[SPEAKER_00]: worked amazingly well in a commercial grow
in Colorado was granulated sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granulated sulfur was applied to the plant
as a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix it with water and spray it on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really need specific info on the
ratio of granulated sulfur in water to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to plants as a miticide and a
fungicide, send me an email,
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will ask my friend I was having this
conversation with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will remind me the exact grams per
gallon and we'll get you guys all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my friend used granulated sulfur in
water and applied it as a foliar spray on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top and bottoms of the leaves the
underside of the leaves, and it got rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: his russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did an application on Monday and
another application on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked again on Monday,
there was no sign of russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good thing about that is it's not
considered a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be loopholes on if you are or
are not allowed to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it in Colorado because it's
not a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be marked as a spray
with the Department of Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're allowed to use that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing I should say if you use
the granulated sulfur, do not apply any
[SPEAKER_00]: oils to your plants a week before or after
using the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five days should be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say a week just to be extra
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add something like azimax or smite
or even azotrol or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreen, if you add that after the
sulfur has been applied or before the
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur has been applied, the oil in the
sulfur will combine and there's a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction that happens that fucking
decimates your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ruin your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not apply sulfur and oils to your
plants within five days of each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even a week to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use granulated sulfur to start
getting rid of the russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you may be in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you could be in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put that fucking flavor
in your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to decide now, do I want to
spray the sulfur or do I want to lose my
[SPEAKER_00]: entire crop to russets because once they
eat the flowering plants, they're headed
[SPEAKER_00]: right back to the veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're headed to the mom plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to eat fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to spray them with the
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work or you don't want to
use that, you can try zero tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero tolerance may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flower, it won't leave a
funky flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it late in flower if
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never recommend spraying anything late
in flower, but if you've got russet mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to go hard right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things I can recommend that will
help you are Grandivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandivo is a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend Grandivo WDG, water dispersed
granules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do somewhere between 10 and 15 grams of
Grandivo per gallon of water and apply it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use Azimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those may help you get rid of your
russets, but you're going to have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very diligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to treat these plants
like every other day, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: products you're using, but you're going to
have to stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do to get rid of the
mites is defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a mite or a mite egg or some
mite damage on a leaf, just pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking leaf off, put it in a trash bag,
seal it, get it off site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you got to do to get that
fucking bag of leaves the fuck out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just taking colonies of mites
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning them with fire if you have the
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Grandivo you can mix Grandivo,
Azimax, push.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mix a lot of pesticides together
and you can come at it for multiple modes
[SPEAKER_00]: of attack and then you get the least
amount of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, imagine if I came at you
with a karate chop and a knife and a gun,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have no way to fucking block that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you have to do to these spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to karate kick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stab them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to shoot them all at the same
fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some Grandivo, maybe some Azimax,
maybe put in some push from vegans bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: just because if you're going to hit them
with all this bad stuff, put some push in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to kind of make the plants happy
while you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can hit them with some evergreen
or some smite, maybe some double nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things you can put in
there, but I think the Grandivo is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sulfur is probably your best
bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If none of that stuff works, or if none of
that sounds like a good idea to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's time to try some predator
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial mites like, this one's hard to
pronounce, the amblyseus endersoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spell it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's A-M-B-L-E-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: L-Y-S-E-I-U-S-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N-I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amblyseus endersoni is known to eat the
russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you need to get some of those
guys, release them in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe they'll get in there and they
will eat the shit out of your russets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend some persimilis
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the swarski's get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if the swarski's will eat the
russets, but they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be no reason why they
shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get in there and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some swarski's, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are amblyseus swarski.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Photosilius persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the new guy we learned about,
the amblyseus endersoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great predators that would get
in there and they would eat the shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they're 100% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not applying anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just releasing bugs the way that
nature would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole bunch of different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope something there works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more guidance, send me an
email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will narrow down what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good luck with the fucking russets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root aphids are fairly easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to kind of make them not want
to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a root drench with Grandivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you Google Grandivo, it's going to
look fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the price of that,
but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do anywhere between 10 and 15
grams of Grandivo in a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per gallon of water and do a root drench
and just soak every plant with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandivo mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should get rid of your root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use Grandivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use Evergreen as a soil
drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere around 15 milliliters per gallon
of Evergreen as a soil drench works very
[SPEAKER_00]: well to get rid of root aphids,
fungus gnats, anything in the soil like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are more established and
they're stronger, you can get closer to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: mils per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with 15, then maybe try 20,
then see what 30 does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe try 30 on one or two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't fuck them up, then go ahead
and feed them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help get rid of root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's another product called
Botanagard Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's B-O-T-A-N-I-G-A-R-D, Botanagard Max,
M-A-X-X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanagard Max is kind of pricey,
but it will work very well to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil borne pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is approved by the MED in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
Division does allow, and the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture will allow the use of all of
the products I've listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grandivo, Azimax, Evergreen,
Botanagard, Cease, Smite, all of those I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure at this time are legal and
able to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Zero Tall, what else is on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Nichols on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just a bunch of pesticides and
products that I know that we use quite
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the commercial grow settings,
those are all allowed by the MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know the new rules on the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not apply the sulfur in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not my research to be done,
but it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may wanna do research if you're in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if it's allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it even needs to be mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's not a pesticide, it's not a
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it even need to be listed on your
ingredients list?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the rules about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several products you can use
to get rid of your root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you're gonna say, I wanna go
organic, and I don't wanna go putting
[SPEAKER_00]: products into my soil, and that shit's
gonna be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what I'm gonna say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to our friends at Arbico Organics
and let's grab some beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the ones that you're gonna want to
get rid of your root aphids are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be called, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called aphid parasites and aphid
predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I would recommend making sure
that what you've got are aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids have, I'm pretty sure that I was
taught that the difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids and the fungus gnats, all aphids
have two little tailpipes is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure I was taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fungus gnats are just the little
black flies that if you smack the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: they fly up out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would verify which insect you've got
and then I would work from there and work
[SPEAKER_00]: on getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got aphids or fungus gnats,
all of the sprays and drenches I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: will work, but you may need different
predator bugs to get rid of different
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I wanna move forward with
this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I really hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part of the email says,
could you also point me in the direction
[SPEAKER_00]: of where to find a grow kashi bucket or
how to make one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are easy to search for on
Amazon, but you have to search for a
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi, B-O-K-A-S-H-I, a Bokashi compost
kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 49.99 on Amazon, which is a very
reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow stores, they're closer to 60 because
they know they can mark that shit up on
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a Bokashi bucket, just go search for
Bokashi on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you type in Bokashi,
type in Bokashi bucket DIY.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you how to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a very quick, basic rundown on how
to do it and I'm just doing this by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the Bokashi bucket,
both on my counter a few feet away from me
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this picture here on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna need a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need another bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can either be a three or a five,
as long as it's about the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's about the same diameter as the
other bucket, it's going to kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: as a lid for the other bucket and it's
also gonna have a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to get a lid on it and also be
about the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two five gallon buckets or a five and a
three that are near the same diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The five gallon bucket, you will put a
hole near the bottom that will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: spigot in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you will drain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your five gallon bucket with
the drain toward the bottom so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can drain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you take your three gallon bucket and
poke some holes in the bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you throw all of your shit into the
three gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add your Bokashi activator,
which you'll have to order also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some Bokashi or Grokashi bio
activator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need a little bit of it to get it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your three gallon bucket
with holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put down a layer of newspaper just to
stop shit from falling through the holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it builds up, the moisture will poke
through the paper and you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: drain it properly and it will slow down
any debris from falling through and
[SPEAKER_00]: clogging up your spigot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a five gallon bucket with a
spigot on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a three gallon bucket with
holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put a layer of one sheet of
newspaper on top of the holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put your food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put all my vegetable scraps in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My avocado seeds, the shells from my
avocados, the ends from my tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ends from the carrots, leftover
salads, whatever like that shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: any vegetables or fruit, the ends of the
strawberries, the ends of the watermelons,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all goes in the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put about an inch or two inches worth
of food waste in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I sprinkle a handful of the
activator on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you set the three gallon bucket
inside of it, do the paper, put the food
[SPEAKER_00]: waste in there, sprinkle the bio activator
on there and seal the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time you have, I would save up
the scraps in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't open it every time because it
starts to fucking stink and oxygen does
[SPEAKER_00]: not help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep this thing sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep all my food scraps in a bowl
kind of near the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the bowl starts getting
full, I peel off the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw in a bowl full of food scraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put in a sprinkle, just a
little sprinkle, a nice little layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: the activator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I seal it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after about 10 to 15 days,
so you can days ish, you can usually start
[SPEAKER_00]: opening the spigot and draining out a
little bit of the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably open it right now and get
half a mason jar full of just disgusting
[SPEAKER_00]: juice out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called leachate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is high in a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean and Jesse tell me it's mostly lactic
acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that it really works like an
enzyme would work for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed when I recycled soil,
I used to do a lot of soil recycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would put the lactic acid bacteria,
it would dilute it heavily and put the
[SPEAKER_00]: lactic acid bacteria in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those old roots would really decay much
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it helps speed up the decay of
dying and dead matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I've used it to unclog shower
drains and sink drains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that when you pour it
down the drain, it leaves the chrome super
[SPEAKER_00]: shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes dead and dying organic matter
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you feed it to your plants,
when you just mix a little bit of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: with your regular basic feed or if you're
making a tea or whatever, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a good thing to add to
your lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, you can get it at amazon
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to Amazon and search for the
B-O-K-A-S-H-I Bokashi Compost Kit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the base model for $49.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it even comes with a bag of
the activator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the cool little rake to mash the
shit down because you want to push down
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes with some instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, just be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking stinks when you crack it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go mashing the stuff down in
there to make room to squeeze the air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will run everybody out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to do it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make your own, make sure it doesn't
leak because when it starts dripping that
[SPEAKER_00]: juice, that juice will stink forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it on your hands, your hands
will stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink and then
I'm going to read another email that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of goes along with this one because it
talks about Scrogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am back and I
am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to get to this next
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Dank Mile
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Rasta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last episode you spoke on Scrogging and
you recommended heavy defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have limited space with the screen of
green method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the first things that I noticed
was how limited your mobility can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the middle of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could go more into
depth on how you would advise someone to
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate four five by five by five
canopies in a rather tight 12 by 12 grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't missed any of your new episodes
since I started listening a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran a five pack of Black Cherry Kim
and have found a keeper that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim dominant with plush berry coming
through in the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever come to the Midwest Cup,
I'll show you some samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it easy, Dank Mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there's some great talking
points in this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, when you were doing a screen of green
method, I recommend heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take off a lot of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at my pictures from the
commercial grow, you'll notice that we
[SPEAKER_00]: make them naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes trim time, there's not a lot
of big fan leaf to take off because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: already taken it off by week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do recommend heavy defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got limited space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in a room that has 24 tables and
they've got about a foot of square of
[SPEAKER_00]: extra footage on each side of me total
around the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 12 inches of extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's maybe 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk through there, but there's 18
inches of extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to slide the plants,
the trays apart, got to walk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a water, got to slide them back
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself laying on my back inside of
a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself just crawling like a monkey
under there, however I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five, so I can reach quite a
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can reach all the way to the center of
that canopy, but sometimes I can't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side of a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will literally lay on my back and
wiggle army crawl underneath the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and get to what I need to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to do it is just get in there
and do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to crawl on the ground,
crawl on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get down there and climb up
in the tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climb up in the tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful not to fuck anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only way to do it is just
get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really frustrating when the space
is so tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put on some good music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in the right head space and go in
there and just get it done, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way it's gonna happen is if
you get in there and pull those leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent an entire eight hour shift just
pulling leaves by myself in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got four tables, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will improve the quality of your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will allow for more light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll prevent bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll prevent molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just help you out overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and just pull them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get taller, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or climb up right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun when you walk into the
ground and you find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six and a half feet tall, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I'm six foot five and 200
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wingspan is super long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find me just curled up underneath
the table just picking leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I wanna keep going with the
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't missed any of your new episodes
since I started listening a couple years
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're also enjoying the Throwback
Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are for the guys like you that
missed all that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep going and you say, I ran a five
pack of Black Cherry Kim and found a
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's some old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grown or made Black Cherry Kim
in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got that keeper, keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let go of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not make more seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have more seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that is in my past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang on to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool that you got one that's Kim
dominant with plush berry through the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them came out either really
purple or really green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you got one kind of in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do ever come to the Midwest Cup,
I'd love to see some samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're ever in Colorado,
I would love to see your samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank Mile, I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I told you pretty much just reach
in there and do it, but that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: way you can do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you can get yourself one of those
mechanical arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when you're a kid and you had
that thing, the fake hand, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: squeeze it and it was like a claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them one of those and get in there
and pick leaves at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, the best way is just shimmy
on up the table, crawl underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen, get in there and just defoliate by
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Dank Mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to
send me an email, I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read your messages on an upcoming
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been going for just over 35 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I go by myself, my voice tends to
burn out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already feel it doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of making you guys listen into
an episode where I'm just clearing my
[SPEAKER_00]: throat, sounding like shit, I'm going to
say thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to remind you to stalk me on
social media.

photography, I put a lot of work into my
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis photography.

pictures as much as I love growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love taking pictures of the plants I
grow as much as I love growing it,

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Tony T in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She says one thing that changes her mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a mystery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes a boy feel blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: From hot to cold, in the blink of an eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she can't be told, but you can try.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about
[SPEAKER_02]: her.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about her, girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about her.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She confusing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what she think or what she do
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, she treat me like a king,
and then she through with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But truly, I give her loving every day,
because it's my duty, even if she kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: moody rides.
[SPEAKER_01]: She make you a king when you do her right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're back to suffering when she puts up
a fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a boy to do with her instabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make every day new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to keep your sanity.

[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about a girl that keeps
you coming back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every little thing she does is magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tragic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to keep up with her is a day to
daily task.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like I've got four girls in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's cranky and mean, but crazy and fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which side I'ma see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this your reality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you with me, always switching
personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep a Hershey kiss, because chocolate
is the key to her heart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She knows it ain't easy being a man.
[SPEAKER_02]: She love you only like a good woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the struggle in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always easy, but she's your best
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to try so hard to figure
her out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you think you have,
she'll make you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a game that you can win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay by her side and be her man.
