Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back, Podcast World!
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 633 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few
shout-outs to a few members of the 710
[SPEAKER_00]: Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 Club are those folks
who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a
[SPEAKER_00]: month level or higher, so with no further
ado, let's kick it off with a big Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart Podcast thank you
shout-out to my friend to my friend Jackie
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytona.

[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can't pull out your phone and
hit that link right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're doing both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're chasing the kids around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're hanging out with the lady and
got this in one earbud acting like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're doing,
but don't get yourself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link will be there when you've got
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's patreon.com forward slash grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start off by thanking everybody
for the tremendous response to the release
[SPEAKER_00]: of the blueberry butcher strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sold out in two different websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to restock them two different times
and then it sold out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a restock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few more packs of those to put
together and get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not expect to sell as many packs as
I did that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you missed the blueberry butcher
episode, I highly recommend you go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and check that out when there are more
seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more seeds very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I'm going to have to
make a lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few more to get out,
so there will be a restock, but grab those
[SPEAKER_00]: while you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get them on the restock,
they will be made again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, you guys, I'm high and rambly,
but thank you for the support on the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry butcher release on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shytownseeds.com for just killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Main topics of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to answer questions from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Patreon supporters, their questions
get moved to the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been slacking on Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of holiday stuff to get
through and then I got distracted by 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back in the swing of Patreon
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question for a cannabis
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend All Mixed Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to All Mixed Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, you do great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love looking at your photos on cannabis,
on Instagram, on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a really good eye for where to
take the shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants look good, so you've got good
subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got good framing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looks like you might have learned
from me, to be honest, but I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give myself credit for that,
but it looks like shots I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking taken, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good damn job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, very good tester work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I send you tester seeds, you do a
damn good job with those also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my friend All Mixed Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into the message because
it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I have got answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says, before I ask my questions,
I just want to say thank you for all that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be the team captain, but without a
captain of the team, without a team,
[SPEAKER_00]: the captain is just a fucking egomaniac.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that I've got a bunch of
people that listen and learn and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate and respect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the feeling is mutual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate, I learn and I respect you
guys just as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of feedback from you that
teaches me as much as I feel like I teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the feeling is mutual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just my friend All Mixed Up,
but the whole army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good teacher once taught me that you can
learn something from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a musician, I learned I can learn
something from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard brand new musicians that have
no idea what they're doing pull off the
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest licks on a guitar, play the
freshest fills on the drums because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the most creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just did some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned something from that little kid
in the guitar center, fucking drum room
[SPEAKER_00]: who just did this thing and I was blown
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it into my repertoire as a
professional drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can learn something from anybody on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some everybody's got something to teach
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned from you guys as much as you
learned from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to learn to stay focused because
I'm rambling as as shit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thank you, Ro, for recognizing my
hard work and my dedication to this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, this community, this craft,
this lifestyle where I'm fucking in it to
[SPEAKER_00]: win it at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, it says, bro, my question goes,
like this, I have a white widow plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I've been growing for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that's a badass plant, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old school white widow was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you've chosen to keep it
around for 20 years, it has got to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat that has got to be a gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I keep a mother plant in veg for
around six months to a year before taking
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of healthy clones, then sending
her into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of us do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep a mother plant around for about six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I chop the mother plant into a
bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flower out the some of the clones and I
keep one of the really good ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the best goes to the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep one of the like the top three as my
new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just keep refreshing that genetic
every three, six, usually about six
[SPEAKER_00]: months, sometimes nine months to a year,
depending on how the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the Mac, you only need to do it
once a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a rise, you got to do it three
times a year just depends on the speed of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend has a white widow plant,
they keep a mother plant, they cut some
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, send it to flower, and then they
keep the mother plant around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is, would it be possible
and actually type Is it be possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it be possible to make seeds of her to
keep her around instead of always keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: a mom plant around taking up space?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend does not want to keep the
mother plant around and they want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mother plant is not always taking
up space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would recommend is just
little tiny bonsai mother plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut a clone as soon as it gets too big,
cut a clone of that as soon as it gets too
[SPEAKER_00]: big, cut a clone of that and just always
have a little tiny one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little tiny, tiny mother plant would be an
option, but that's not what you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked about seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it would be very possible,
very viable to make seeds of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just make S ones, self seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more in detail about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to wrap up the letter and then I'll
get myself on a good rant talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend going this route by
making seeds of this Fino or just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it the way I have been doing it,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your way works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to keep a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a large veg plant going and
as soon as you put it into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut a clone of it and then let that one
keep growing as the next veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have a mother plant per se,
but you've always got a healthy plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: veg that you can get a clone from and then
maybe wait seven to 10 days before you
[SPEAKER_00]: flip it to make sure you're going to get a
clone and then maybe take too many clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I don't know your clone skill,
but you don't have to keep a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a veg plant that is a clone
donor as well and then flower it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one that is a veg plant that goes
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that, but that's a real easy
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to think about making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part where I'm going to focus
because I'm known as being a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the keeping a veg plant and not
having a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can understand how to move
that into the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take the mother plant you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider that a veg plant when it's time
to get clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take three, five, 10 clones from it flower
and I think that's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you figured out that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about making seeds because that
is where my area of expertise does lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does wrap it up with thanks Ross to
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the feedback, the input and
the great question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make preservation seeds of
this strain so that you've got it forever,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I would do and this would
work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just don't want to keep this
strain around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to go on vacation and
simply just not grow for a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want to come back and have a
reliable stock of something to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just want to move and you can't
move the plants with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or however you want to preserve this
forever in seed form, this is how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would reverse the plant to keep it pure
and use that plant as the pollen donor and
[SPEAKER_00]: the female plant, the pollen receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we're not adulterating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this to happen, you've got to make
feminized S1 selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to cut one clone and that
will be selected as your pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female right now, but we're going
to make it give you pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would cut two or three other
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be the pollen receivers that
are going to make you seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds will come from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your pollen giver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look the same right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all clones of that white widow
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look the same, but we're going to
take one and we're going to treat it with
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on making
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those two episodes together,
you should be able to get at least a good
[SPEAKER_00]: head start, a good blueprint on how to
make femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to hit me up for details,
questions, maybe search the internet for
[SPEAKER_00]: some fine details, some fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think with what I gave you,
you should be able to make, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find and make the silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you should be able to execute the
process of reversing the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating the pollen receiver plants and
creating seeds out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you listen well, and I know you can
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got the knowledge all ready
from listening to the show to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you keep it pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you come back to these
seeds, it is unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just your white widow plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other way of crossing this plant to
make seeds would adulterate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took another male plant and
pollinated that female, you're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: new F1 cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be something white widow to
arise, white widow to strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: starburst, white widow to whatever other
male plant you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you grow it, it's not going to be
your white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse the kombucha burps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I would reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're keeping it pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find a little bit of
phenotypical variation, but within five or
[SPEAKER_00]: six seeds, maybe 10 seeds, you'll
definitely find that phenotype that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the one you started with that
you reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut two or more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need one as a pollen
donor, one as a pollen receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my scenario, I would do two or three as
the pollen giver and six as the receiver
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would reverse the other three at
different spray intervals and ratios to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't know how well the others are
going to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure that I got enough plants
to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just extra careful when it comes to
reversing and pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also my career, so I got to rely on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut two or more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, you've got the
knowledge in your head already from
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to my show, how to make silver
thiosulfate, how and when to apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, how to fucking make that plant
create pollen stacks and put that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: on the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't message me, I'll get you
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reverse one plant, pollinate one or
more, and then wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is wait, then harvest
the seeds, then store those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be nice and hard and tiger
striped or at least dark brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pull them out, let them dry
really hard, then store them with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your other seeds well labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've now got a reserve stock of your
white widow and they're feminized also,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're not going to find boys in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to help you out,
but you're not able to breed with that
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you do more reversals or find a
different male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be a male for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause, take a drink and
catch my breath and we'll wrap this
[SPEAKER_00]: question up and move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to ramble on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I pretty much answered this
question about preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut a few clones, reverse one,
pollinate, make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest the seeds, dry them and store
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it comes time to grow this
again, you have got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part about this project,
in my opinion, and many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to agree with me,
is cutting down the plant you've kept for
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making fem seeds out of it, that's just a
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting down a plant that you've been
attached to for 20 years is going to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: strange inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it wasn't before, now that I've
mentioned it, it is certainly going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make you feel some type of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part that's going to be the
real challenge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no SOP for detachment,
for cutting down a plant you've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: love with for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently let go of my flow plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing wrong with flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had flow for 12 years, 13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly just got bored with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred it to everything and it was a great
plant, but it just wasn't, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like a seven out of a 10 and I like
11s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that plant was around through my
evolution as a grower, as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: as like a basement buccaneer to a
commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flow was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flow paid a lot of bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flow paid a lot of favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flow paved a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wake up and smell that plant and
it would make me nauseous because I had
[SPEAKER_00]: been around it, grew it, smelled it,
smoked it, sold it for so long that it had
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're done with this white
widow, but obviously you're not done done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a girl you want to break up
with, but you still keep her number in
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I ain't done yet making these
fem seeds out of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm rambling, but the hardest part
is going to be getting rid of this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make all the seeds you want,
cut all the clones you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck when it's time to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get shaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a video, make a video when you do it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered it thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying that you've got the
information to do the reversal because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know you're a smart person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need help, if you need guidance,
you know, I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all you have to do is ask me for
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, all right, I'm ready to do the
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll guide you through it if you
need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to keep moving because I'm awful
rambly on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from Patreon,
patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from our friend sticky Randy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Rasta, Jeff, here's a good
question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of notes should I take while
doing a breeding phenol hunt for males and
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's kind of up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a very vague, shitty
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are you interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you care about?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main things I look for our germination
ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're asking me like,
you're doing a breeding phenol hunt for
[SPEAKER_00]: males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you looking for males to use in the
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not sure what exactly you're
asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for notes for taking, I always take
like notes on germination rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many sprout throw 100 seeds in a paper
towel and see how many of them pop,
[SPEAKER_00]: write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my germination ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy number to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real easy number to math up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good number to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I start germination
ratios, then how many of those made it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of them were males and females?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many looked like shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many were vigorous?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my plants are labeled with a number
and or a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of anomaly gets written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you notice gets written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're interested in as
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see growth structure at certain
times how it responds to certain things I
[SPEAKER_00]: do to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I fed it recharge, did it over get too
absorbed too much nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes if you feed it too much
recharge, it'll make it cycle too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I gave it calm egg, did the leaves
get real serrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did it start to get pale on me because
I overfed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down notes like that things that I
notice, I write down every feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I mix up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got a 25 gallon, I will say a
20 gallon reservoir, it's easier to do
[SPEAKER_00]: math.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do a 20 gallon reservoir,
I write down that I put 60 mils of this
[SPEAKER_00]: product in there, 120 mils of this product
in there, 10 mils of this product in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I write down as I pour it in,
I've just, it's a Google document,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just opened it up and I type 60,
I pour in 60, then go to the next product
[SPEAKER_00]: type in Equinox 120, pour in the 120 of
Equinox, 74 grams of shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a fucking wild
exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making up numbers now,
but put a bunch of shine in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: stir it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then guess what I do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I measure the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measure the EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what I do then I write those down in
a Google document.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Google documents for the pH,
the EC, the feed, and the runoff in and
[SPEAKER_00]: out for the past fucking six years of my
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I come up with any issues,
scroll through, I've got a good guideline
[SPEAKER_00]: on what might have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are notes I take, you're asking
about breeding, inter nodal structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: how far apart are the nodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like a criteria in your head
that you say, these branches are squatty,
[SPEAKER_00]: these branches are sturdy, these branches
are stretchy, these branches are twisty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has a Christmas tree structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has a fern like stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you have something, even if it's
just a guideline or a bracket system in
[SPEAKER_00]: your own head, do you have something like
that to compare the plants to in your own
[SPEAKER_00]: head?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you find important is what's
important for your grow notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously structure, appearance,
leaf size, leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germination rates, growth rates,
aroma, rub the stems, give it a smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: rub the leaves, give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the leaves perking up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the leaves drooping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there 10 plants in the room and one of
them is doing something different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that one plant is doing,
write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also stand near that plant and look
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the air conditioner blowing on that
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the heater blowing on that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the humidifier extra humidifying that
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it right under one of the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it right far away from one of the
lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the shit I write down because the
scientific method requires all of the data
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say, I've got 10 plants and this
one over here is growing real tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: that must be the best plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the lights right there and we
don't know that and we pick that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: we take that plant to our facility and
fill the entire facility with that one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and it doesn't perform the way it
did in that one situation because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: right next to the fucking light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it was right by the heater and it loved
that heat and we don't know that that one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant got the heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's no scientific method to
that, unless you write down every detail
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, details we cannot see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity, temperature, VPD, anything you
can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write all of that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, one of the
things I like the guys to do, guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: gals, now there are lots of lovely,
excellent ladies working in the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk in and out of a commercial
grow room, I have you write down the VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature and humidity on a little
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just it gives us accountability,
also makes you look.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you walk in the room,
you check the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get complacent in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the staff is busy thinking about
task A and they get color blind or they
[SPEAKER_00]: get the blinders on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunnel vision is the word I'm looking for
and they can't focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just walk right in there and they
don't realize that the room is super humid
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're going in there just to
find that pair of scissors at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: that hallway, at the end of that fucking
grow table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't realize it's super humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they walk in there every time they
got to look at the monitor, write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD, the temperature and the humidity and
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way I know the last time that
Mark came in here, Mark is a made up name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't yell at Mark for fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time Mark came in here,
he looked at the VPD and it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was two hours ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something happened when the last hour and
a half we got to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at the cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what went wrong in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the dehumidifier broken?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the air conditioner stuck on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one of the blowers in the room stuck
somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we start investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every little detail make notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can find the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every it's like a murder investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more shit you know, the easier it is
to solve the crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times when you find a problem
in the grow, it's like a big old who done
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too cold in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too hot in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that shit is going to go through
your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you see an issue in the grow,
you're going to go, Oh, what did I feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: last time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you spray it anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm a consultant and I come to your
grow to help you out, those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I'm going to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you spray anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the last thing you sprayed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was the product you sprayed
before that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's see if those two products
are having a reaction on your leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be fucking everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may solve the problem just by looking
at paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not have to leave the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could have saved yourself half
of the consulting fee by doing it over
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom and not making me drive all the way
to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the minute I put on my dunks,
I start charging you extra money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm driving to the facility,
it costs you double what it costs for
[SPEAKER_00]: costs for me to do a consultation on zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a business way of doing
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could save yourself half the money
by having double the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep fucking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask you, what did you
spray these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you spray them before that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many milliliters of whatever shit you
sprayed on there was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who applied it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you soak the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just spray them till they're
running off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you spray them with a mist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you spray them from the underside or
do you spray them from the top?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sprayed them, did you turn the
lights off or turn the lights on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got notes for those
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to ask you, what did you
feed these plants last?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you fed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the PPM or EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a runoff chart that I can look
at to see what looked like for the past
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks until the week when shit went
wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the questions I'm going to want
to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to ask you, what was the
VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD can cause and solve so many problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put you outside for two weeks and
made you just deal with shit, you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd go through some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fix your whole life with the VPD
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask you all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have those notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the notes I recommend having for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said phenol hunt for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure, shape, aroma, leaf size,
color, trichome density, trichome size and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants have long, skinny,
tall trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have shorter, thicker, fatter
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, you get a different buzz
from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing to make concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make concentrates,
you want the taller, skinnier trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come apart from the buds better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to manhandle your buds,
maybe you want those shorter, thicker
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate makers are going to have
feedback and opinions on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the notes that you would take,
honestly, I got way far rambling into the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds on that, but the notes are all about
what are important to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What matters to you when it comes to your
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to want to pay
attention to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to want to document?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some OCD in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing things on a different level
because I've got a different passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain is on that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to be OCD about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to take copious notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridiculous notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to take just enough notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can not even take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke right before I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I put on music, put on my
favorite song, put on my favorite podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Joey Diaz cussing me on my left ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking cruising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple dabs and go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got Joey, what's up, cocksucker?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grow some fucking weed
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, hell yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a couple dabs and go in and get
all these marvelous ideas and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, oh, I'm going to do this and
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to feed the plants
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't take fucking notes,
I don't remember any of the marvelous
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I did to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take a lot of notes because I like to
smoke dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm listening to Uncle Joey or some
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I don't remember a goddamn
thing because I'm nice and high in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should take notes on what is important
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticky Randy, I rambled on about that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely got a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more questions,
if I can dial that in for you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better, send me some feedback because I do
want to make sure I answer your questions
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went overboard on that one, bro.
