[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to take a brief moment to send a
big shout out a big big some love some
[SPEAKER_00]: energy to everybody in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been watching the news,
the Boulder area of Colorado has been
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing suffering from some extreme
fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have lost their homes,
their properties, their businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: their belongings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of shit has burnt down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is devastating to watch on the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people personally who have lost
homes, items, animals, a lot of shit went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out lots of love and energy
to all of the people in Boulder that
[SPEAKER_00]: entire area suffering through those fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is terrible to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their houses got burned down and then the
next day we got a foot of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got their asses kicked up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of love to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some help, if you need
anything, reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to help you out any way
that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, big shout out to everybody in
Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody going through
some rough stuff at the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start the year with some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this is of course the first
episode of the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's shift gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick off the new year strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do as growers, as breeders,
as cannabis consumers to kick off the new
[SPEAKER_00]: year strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start goals and journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing, you should have a grow
room journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside of that journal, you should create
some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to get better at this
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you fuck up last year in your
grow that you didn't like the way you did
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know you could have done better?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to improve on this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Set some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set some ways to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success in this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have any goals, if you don't
have any objectives, any notes,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you know if you're improving?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what you did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the second part of that journal,
let's start taking a lot of notes so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when the grow comes out better or worse
than last time, we know exactly what we
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off this new year by
starting a journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that journal, let's set some goals and
some objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we're working in the grow room,
let's write down everything we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mix up a feed solution,
write down how much water you started
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a five gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have a 10 gallon
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rock a 30 gallon reservoir in one space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another room, I've got a 250 gallon
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on where I'm working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But write down the amount of water you
started with and then write down
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix up 100 milliliters of this
nutrient and pour it into your 250 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: res, write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with 250 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I poured in 100 mils of this, 150 mils of
this, this much of this nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: this many grams of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff I feed is in a powdered
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pHed it to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I put in the pH down or the pH up to
get it to the 6.2 to 6.4 range I would
[SPEAKER_00]: approve of, then I checked the EC and I
wrote down the EC also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know every nutrient that went in and
exactly how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the EC of that total solution
was at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the pH was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I feed those plants, I can watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if some shit goes wrong in a few days,
I've got a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say, well, it's because we gave it
1,000 milliliters of this instead of 850.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know not to give it 850.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to 1,000 just to stick it 850,
maybe 900 next time we push that bitch a
[SPEAKER_00]: little too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got a little bit fried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that you can learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us who are cannabis growers and
breeders, we are heavy cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like taking a couple of
fat dads or smoking a big fat joint on the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the grow place, wherever you're
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't smoke in the car while
you're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke right when you get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got to be safe with what we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke while you're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow all the legal laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: But smoke right before you go into the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's legal, it's like a Zen feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to get fucking stoned and go
in there and work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the music going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in my bubble, my element.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I feel super comfortable on
the stage behind some drums and in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and obviously behind this microphone
doing a podcast or some of my comfort
[SPEAKER_00]: zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to get a little blazed and go in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, when you get blazed and go
in there, you get in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just start doing shit like mix up
nutrients, adjust the pH, test the EC,
[SPEAKER_00]: water the plants, catch some runoff,
test the runoff sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do runoff reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to delve into the runoff
reports right now, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: will also test the runoff of the feed
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to have a little
drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the EC and the pH of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand how to decipher that
code later in the future, that may help
[SPEAKER_00]: you solve some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to be in there doing your
routine and then you're just going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get in the flow and then
you're going to run into either great
[SPEAKER_00]: success or great problems in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to remember what you
did to cause that success or that failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would have just done a few things,
taken a couple of notes, do a few things,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a couple of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the grow, the more notes I
take, which I guess that's because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more of an investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll carry a clipboard around and a
big grow and just write down what I did
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I've got a couple of guys doing
work, I have them report to me at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day and I fill out just a big
report of everything they got done in
[SPEAKER_00]: every room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to compile all of the EC reports,
the feed reports, all the, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what got defoliated, what got lollipop and
twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were any equipment issues that
were noticed, if any bugs were issued,
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed in the room, write down
everything that you can in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, like I said, if you have good
success or big failure, you can repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can create what is known in the
commercial industry as a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that on day one, we do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day two, we do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write a book and then every time
you grow, you can follow your own
[SPEAKER_00]: instruction manual and you can nail that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can learn how to improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you've got some sort of standardized
sample, you don't know that you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that you're proving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we wanna keep notes,
see what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've been rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check on my notes and see where we
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything that you spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are spraying food, a pesticide or a
foliar application, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying to the plants, write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we are required to write down
any pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticides have to be approved by the
Colorado Department of Agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado Department of Agriculture,
the Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of letters to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be on an approved pesticide
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write down the pesticide you
applied, how much of it per gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water, how many gallons of that solution
were mixed up and applied, the EPA number
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pesticide you used, the time you
applied it, the plant numbers of which got
[SPEAKER_00]: applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of notes to be taken in a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just start doing that in your own
personal grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, there are a lot of advantages to
writing down these pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something goes wrong in the future,
you've got that paper trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why you've got that weird rash on
your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the doctor, you could say
on five days ago, I applied this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peel the label off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the label to the hospital with you
when you go see the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them what you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them you didn't use proper protective
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a little rash from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But write down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything we do in a commercial grow
has to be written down and marked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in the habit of doing that now,
because what if you end up working in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can tell when you go apply
for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say I'm already documenting
pesticides to Department of Agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already practicing that standard in my
personal growth, so I'm comfortable doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to work in a big grow,
that'd be a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've rambled on for the first
part of this podcast long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start a journal, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up for success in this
new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a brand new calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just turned the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many harvests are you going to pull
off this calendar year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get six harvests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get five point five harvests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you stagger them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just want four harvests?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have enough rooms to get six harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to improve on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you really suck at before?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you not happy with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people, their clone game sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people aren't exactly sure how to sex
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are afraid to pop seeds
because they don't know how to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're afraid of that, I'm here to help
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of resources that will
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Discord server, my website,
me personally, the podcast, the ivory
[SPEAKER_00]: army.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will definitely help you identify your
males and your females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pop some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a new new goal for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expand our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get any better if you
keep doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're satisfied with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't you want a little bit more for
your money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can just learn how to save a
little bit of electricity and still put
[SPEAKER_00]: out the same amount of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can save you a few bucks
somewhere and that will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if your product is as good as you
think it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can save money on lights,
air, water, soil, maybe a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a way that we can
improve you this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what you feed, what you mix,
what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down a schedule and a plan and a
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some sort of a flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do your clones live in the clone
machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do your seedlings stay in that
small section?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you put them into smaller pots and
have small veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do they go into the bigger veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you veg those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when do you put them into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they go into flower, how often do you
defoliate?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you lollipop?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you pop and twist?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you start adding your bloom
boosters based on your specific feed
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set some goals and routines based on
this new schedule we've got for a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys write everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling about that part for
long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to segue into the second half of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finally snowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be a big deal to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, we've been getting very
worried about drought-like conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're not getting any snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're into January.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that we get snow on
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a big joke that we arrange our
Halloween costume in Colorado around the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather because it always snows on
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see people out there, the girls in
their Tinkerbell costumes and the guys in
[SPEAKER_00]: their whatever costumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what dudes wear anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there in their costumes,
little tiny, Walmart outfits because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't buy expensive shit for Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just freezing their nuts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always joke that you got to set your
costume up around a jacket or some long
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I was always Chewbacca.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that long, just a big fursuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even wear anything under it and
I'm nice and warm all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I gave you that detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we didn't get any snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been too many months without some
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound like an old guy talking about that,
but that brings drought-like conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't get any water for the summer,
which leads to forest fires, which leads
[SPEAKER_00]: to shit like we've had in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what is happening in the Boulder
Superior area right now, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the weather would have been a little
bit more moist, a little bit more snow,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little rain, we may not have had such
devastating fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound like an old guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound like a too old guy sitting on the
porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get no water soon, but that's
really how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we finally got some snow and when it
snowed, boy, did it snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is deep out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drive a Ford SUV and the snow is up to
about at least halfway, a little bit past
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway from my tires, which is a lot of
snow for my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the city here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually don't get that much,
so it dumped on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature is confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, you guys, it is cold now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just suddenly went from really nice to
super duper cold here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in Colorado, if you are in
North America, now is the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have not already, now is the time
to jump our grow rooms into winter
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, winter preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you're growing at all,
but if it gets cold outside, now is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: to make some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can learn a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can save some electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move heat around to the right
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not have to duct as many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a few things to adjust
now that it is winter time, because being
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, being indoor growers,
this is mostly going to apply to the
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have to learn to adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't expect the exact same things that
worked in the summer to work for us in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need to make some gear changes,
some room changes, just some basic
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments just to maximize potential for
our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our plants to still do the best in
the winter as they do in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, my fall crop, when I grow
indoors in my personal grow, my crop like
[SPEAKER_00]: around Halloween is always the best
because it's not super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets hot here in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have 102, 110 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets negative 17 in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that fall crop when it's like actually
tolerable conditions for plants and humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't have to fight the sun and
the snow in your grow space, those crops
[SPEAKER_00]: are always the finest in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, those are the most successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to learn to adjust and adapt
due to seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a couple of
adjustments that I make automatically when
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually run in the summer, springtime,
the warmer part of the year, I run LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I recently fell in love
with the LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running the Canon LEDs from
Blacksail, big up to our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Blacksail Market, argh, whatever else
their slogans are these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up with our friends at Blacksail
Market, give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good lightings, good lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the Cannons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make my plants bushy and dense and
they do all the things I need them to do
[SPEAKER_00]: now that I've learned them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a learning curve figuring out how
to use the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the winter, those lights do not
provide enough heat to keep my grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to keep that room warm, I simply
replace the LED lighting with HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take down a few LEDs and I put up three
HPS lights and those keep that small space
[SPEAKER_00]: warm very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to duck the air out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do run a duct out to get the humidity
out, but I don't run it as often as I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I switched those lights out to create
some heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the cool LEDs in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually want the hot HPS lights in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another thing that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put those lights on a different
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will run the HPS lights during the night
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of having the lights on from 9
a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will run the HPS lights from 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: till 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make sure to carefully adjust my
light cycle if I've got plants and flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm experienced in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also done a full podcast on how
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful if you're adjusting plants
that are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just don't give them a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them an extended night to get back on
schedule is the tip there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will run the lights during the night
because it gets colder at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets colder at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally, the sun goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use my grow lights to keep my plants
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep the space warmer during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heater is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grow space will stay ambiently warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays the same temperature as the rest
of the building, the rest of the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is ambient temperature because
there's central heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the place stays warm during the normal
part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it gets cold outside,
that sun drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything gets colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to keep it a little bit warmer in
there, the lights do come on during the
[SPEAKER_00]: night cycle during the night time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the night time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I would be asleep, the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for me very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one quick adjustment that I do
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I think about is moving
and ducting my hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those warm lights are creating hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a veg room, which is also filled
with warm air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to duck that air out of the grow
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to go outside so that it would
just get away from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that it's warm, I utilize that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sometimes I'll dump some of that
heat into a bedroom and just warm up the
[SPEAKER_00]: house with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the rooms are right and conditions work
out, sometimes I'll dump the heat from the
[SPEAKER_00]: veg room into the flower room during the
night time so that that flowering room
[SPEAKER_00]: will get some heat during its dark cycle
and not get too cold while the lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all small adjustments that you
can learn to custom tailor for your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you getting too much heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you like that heat to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it too cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you like that cool to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to manipulate and move that air
around and save yourself on electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: and ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your grow room as sufficient as you
can make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter time is a good time to learn that
it's a completely different struggle than
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn to move the air around instead of
dumping it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste that hot air in the winter
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heat it up that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it somewhere useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing else, dump it into the house
and keep the house warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already paid for the electricity to
warm that air up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep that heat in the house in
somewhere in the facility to at least warm
[SPEAKER_00]: up a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe warm up a bedroom, warm up
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste that hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's think about something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are dumping that hot air out
somewhere, are you melting the snow in a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird section to where your whole
neighborhood knows that that is a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where the heat is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all seen that photo from Canada
where the guy's got the apartment building
[SPEAKER_00]: and his apartment is the only one with the
snow melting off of it and they busted him
[SPEAKER_00]: for growing weed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing that in the winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you snitching on yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your blower melting snow in an awkward
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is your roof the only roof,
that attic space, the only space in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood without a bunch of snow on it
because your grow is up there melting that
[SPEAKER_00]: snow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how you're going to bust
yourself here in the winter because the
[SPEAKER_00]: snow could give you away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beware of the evidence, is what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, another thing I want to talk
about is warming up our water,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we use to water our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of the commercial grows that I used
to run, the water would come from a well
[SPEAKER_00]: basically outside into the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, that water would be
extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to put heaters in the reservoirs
to warm up the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your water comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water is coming from outside,
in the winter, the pipes are outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming into your home,
into your commercial facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice, fill up your reservoirs,
whatever you're holding water in,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill those up the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of the commercial grows where I
work, we will just get trash cans on
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels, a big Rubbermaid or a Brute trash
can, a 50 gallon trash can on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll fill those up with water and we will
move those into the veg room under the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to stay there overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come back, they have reached room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're safe to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't water your plants with extremely
cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go less than 70 degrees,
maybe 68 at the very lowest, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want cold water watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about putting your toes,
your balls, your hands, and some cold
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to piss you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to make you want to drink
or eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to make you angry that
we'll do the same thing to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not piss them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get that water nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another thing we could do is get the
plants up off of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grow room is cold, if you're
growing in the basement or a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility with a concrete floor,
let's not have the plants on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That floor is very cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't comfortable walking around
on that floor barefoot, the plants are not
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put that water or that
plant on the cold floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to pour water into it and
that cold floor is going to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: water really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to feed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pH is going to get all out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to go really wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can, get those plants up off of
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise them up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get another pot, whatever size
pot you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll raise your plant up a couple of
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the plant right on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use pallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like pallets because I kick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trip on them and they're wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like adding that wood into the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's what you got to do,
that's what you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer you get a table with a
hydro tray in there and put the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: that and put a drains where they could
drain into something underneath and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could pull out the drain and get rid of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's spending some money that's going in
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get those plants up off the ground for
the winter because like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can't put your bare feet on that
floor and walk around and some of you
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfuckers got those Chewbacca fee,
you can't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been at the festival for your whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those plants up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximum root growth, maximum potential if
the roots are nice and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I've covered all of my
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for

[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my New Year's resolutions once
again is to be better at answering my
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to answer all of the emails
that come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Patreon messages, Discord
messages, multiple email accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making excuses, but it is just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only one answering all of those
emails, doing these shows, living a life,
[SPEAKER_00]: building a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my resolutions, however,
is to get better at answering those emails
[SPEAKER_00]: and answer more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I answer them, you guys reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got to answer that again and
then you reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like it's it's I'm just
kidding, but we'll catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get more emails answered.
