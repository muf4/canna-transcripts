[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy
these chunks of old episodes, so here we
[SPEAKER_08]: go with the Throwback Thursday episode of
the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: welcome back cannabis community,
and it's time for episode number 95 of the
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to turn down this music.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a little bit loud this time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not have any ads for this show,
but I do want to give a shout out to
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel for being a great reggae date.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, big shout out to Rasta Stevie.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think sometimes you might listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys, I've got a couple of
things coming up in this episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to address an email that was
sent to me from a friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to talk about something I said in
the episode about bag seeds, so we will
[SPEAKER_08]: discuss that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, I want to read a news article
that just came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: This article came out on September 16th.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it in the Cannabis Of Course.
[SPEAKER_08]: This article was written by David Magoya
and Ricardo Baca, and the article headline
[SPEAKER_08]: says, Colorado Ag, Examining Pot Industry
Use of Organic Term.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sub headline says, because marijuana is
illegal under federal law, the use of the
[SPEAKER_08]: term organic is federally regulated.
[SPEAKER_08]: The state licensed cannabis business can't
be certified as organic no matter their
[SPEAKER_08]: practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to turn up my headphones just a
little bit, and then I will read this
[SPEAKER_08]: article for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Headphones are loud enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: A mic check.
[SPEAKER_08]: Headphones.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's much better.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado's Attorney General is
investigating several marijuana businesses
[SPEAKER_08]: over concerns the word organic in their
names or advertising might be misleading
[SPEAKER_08]: to consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: The office is reviewing complaints from
the consumers that the merchants have been
[SPEAKER_08]: misrepresenting their product when they
say organic or organically grown,
[SPEAKER_08]: said Roger Hudson, spokesman for State
Attorney General Cynthia Kaufman.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking for information inside those
complaints to make a determination on what
[SPEAKER_08]: those next steps are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it consumer fraud?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it criminal?
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ag's office would not give more detail
on the scope of the investigation,
[SPEAKER_08]: but a lawyer who represents a marijuana
business contacted by investigators said
[SPEAKER_08]: it appears to have limits.
[SPEAKER_08]: The inquiry includes grow operations,
some with organic in their names.
[SPEAKER_08]: Recently caught up in Denver quarantines
over pesticide concerns, Attorney Sean
[SPEAKER_08]: McAllister said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry guys, I read that statement a little
bit oddly, but you caught what I said.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ag is ensuring that businesses that
use the word are at least consistent with
[SPEAKER_08]: the concept of organic, McAllister said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because marijuana is illegal under federal
law and use of the term organic is
[SPEAKER_08]: federally regulated, a licensed cannabis
business cannot be certified as organic no
[SPEAKER_08]: matter its practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: As such, no marijuana businesses in
Colorado can technically use the word in
[SPEAKER_08]: its name or in selling its product
according to officials and industry
[SPEAKER_08]: insiders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Potential fraud penalties under the
Colorado Consumer Protection Act include
[SPEAKER_08]: fines of up to $10,000 per violation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Federal rules say that businesses wrongly
selling a product as organic could face
[SPEAKER_08]: fines of up to $10,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet those rules have not been enforced in
Colorado's marijuana businesses until now.
[SPEAKER_08]: State marijuana license records show that
29 businesses, growers, retailers,
[SPEAKER_08]: and dispensaries use the word organic in
their name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some use a trade name containing the word
organic to market marijuana products or
[SPEAKER_08]: use the term or do use the term in their
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_08]: A spot check of websites by the Denver
Post found businesses claiming to sell
[SPEAKER_08]: 100% organic cannabis, offering organic
treatments of medical marijuana or use
[SPEAKER_08]: only organic methods to produce their
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some shops describe their product as grown
in organic soil or that they use organic
[SPEAKER_08]: growing techniques.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another website touts certification of
organic standards and testing that mirrors
[SPEAKER_08]: the US Department of Agriculture organic
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brook Wise, owner of the Growing Kitchen
in Boulder, said that she's willing to
[SPEAKER_08]: take the risk of labeling her company's
edibles, made with certified organic seeds
[SPEAKER_08]: and fruits, as organic even if the
marijuana in them isn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a principle, an ideology that doesn't
belong to anybody, she said, noting her
[SPEAKER_08]: plants would be certified organic if that
existed.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the list of sacrifices and gambles I
take, organic is definitely on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But River Rock Cannabis in Denver has
backed away from using the term until
[SPEAKER_08]: recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: The company had been known as River Rock
Organic Medical Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: The attorney general sent something saying
that no dispensary can be certified as
[SPEAKER_08]: organic, retail manager Chris Haggerty
said.
[SPEAKER_08]: The company changed signs, stopped handing
out promotional items with the company's
[SPEAKER_08]: name, and even stopped selling t-shirts
with the old company name, Haggerty said.
[SPEAKER_08]: A group seeking to have marijuana
certifiable as organic said a system for
[SPEAKER_08]: informing consumers how marijuana is grown
is needed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The word organic is being used
inappropriately by people who are using
[SPEAKER_08]: very toxic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no governing agency that is
regulating that, said John Paul Maxfield,
[SPEAKER_08]: co-founder of the Organic Cannabis
Association in Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the absence of a body coming through
and branding organic cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: that term can be used by everybody even if
it's not done properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: The USDA accredits companies and state
governments to certify any farm as
[SPEAKER_08]: complying with federal organic regulations
for agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_08]: No company may use the term without this
certification.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marijuana may not be certified organic
under the USDA Organic Regulations,
[SPEAKER_08]: said a USDA spokesman who could not be
named because it's the agency's policy
[SPEAKER_08]: when discussing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marijuana is considered a controlled
substance at the federal level and organic
[SPEAKER_08]: certification is reserved for agricultural
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: The USDA's National Organic Program rules
say companies with organic in their name
[SPEAKER_08]: cannot prominently display it on a product
and cannot use the name at all if it
[SPEAKER_08]: misrepresents that a product has been
certified organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It falls to the Colorado Department of
Agriculture to certify and to credit
[SPEAKER_08]: agricultural businesses in the state as
organic as well as police for
[SPEAKER_08]: inappropriate and illegal uses of the word
on behalf of the USDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the state chose to certify marijuana as
organic, it would have to ignore federal
[SPEAKER_08]: rules and that's unlikely, said Mitch
Yerger, director of CDA's Plant Industry
[SPEAKER_08]: Division.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird because we've already ignored
federal rules and we have legalized
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational cannabis, so why wouldn't we
just do it again?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The state's inquiry came after the Denver
Department of Environmental Health this
[SPEAKER_08]: year quarantined more than 100,000
marijuana plants over pesticide concerns.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their actual corporation name is Organic
Greens, but they don't use it in
[SPEAKER_08]: advertising, so they don't publicize
themselves as organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't do any advertising as organic,
so nobody's being misled, McAllister said,
[SPEAKER_08]: confirming the company name under ag
scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_08]: McAllister said the ag is focusing,
at least in part, on companies that have
[SPEAKER_08]: used pesticides not allowed by the state
for use on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: They understand you can't get federal
certification for the word organic in
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana, he said.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ag's office is not substituting
themselves for a certification agency,
[SPEAKER_08]: but if it's clearly not organic,
if someone's using mallet or Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're also looking for those cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mallet and Eagle 20 are pesticide trade
names whose active ingredients contain
[SPEAKER_08]: chemicals the state has not approved for
use on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've said this on a previous episode,
but I was speaking with somebody from the
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually came to, I'm the master
grower at the spot dispensary,
[SPEAKER_08]: so I had to meet with the Department of
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: They sent two reps down to come talk to
us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the main rep told me that the main
reason that Eagle 20 has been banned from
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary uses is because if there's a
fire and the Eagle 20 burns, the off
[SPEAKER_08]: gassing turns into cyanide and the fire
department doesn't want to go into a
[SPEAKER_08]: building that is filled with the gas of
cyanide.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's mainly why Eagle 20 has been
banned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, it's completely toxic, but he didn't
even seem to care about the toxicity of
[SPEAKER_08]: the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just wanted to tell me about it turning
into cyanide is why it's been banned from
[SPEAKER_08]: use in commercial grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll keep going with the article.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one more sentence here left,
one more short paragraph.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Although no chemical pesticide
can obtain federal approval for use on
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, state agriculture officials have
determined which products have labels
[SPEAKER_08]: whose restrictions are so broadly worded
that using them on marijuana would not be
[SPEAKER_08]: a violation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're cracking down on it,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I first started in the medical
marijuana world, I was shopping at a
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary that had the word organic in
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I knew right away when I looked at the
medicine, when I saw how they grew,
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew there was nothing to do with actual
organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just trying to use the word
organic as a marketing ploy and it was
[SPEAKER_08]: working.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also just to put this out there,
they do require that all of the
[SPEAKER_08]: ingredients used in the grow, anything
that was sprayed or fed to the plants does
[SPEAKER_08]: have to be listed on an instruction list
or instruction ingredients list,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, an ingredients list on the
outside of the container.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of that shit does have to be listed
on the package that the cannabis or hatch
[SPEAKER_08]: is sold in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, let me reach over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just the inner packaging.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one doesn't have the ingredients on
it, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of the time it's got a few things
written on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you come by cannabis in the state
of Colorado, you'll get a little jar,
[SPEAKER_08]: like a childproof jar or whatever they put
the cannabis in and it'll have some
[SPEAKER_08]: ingredients listed on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll see things like calcium and
you'll see things like mycos and
[SPEAKER_08]: beneficial bacteria and you'll see stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all what was used in the growing of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they will also hopefully list any
pesticides that were sprayed on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so they're cracking down on the
name organic and then they are also
[SPEAKER_08]: cracking down to make sure that your shit
is organic, which I really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like that because there are a lot
of shops serving up doo-doo that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: tell it was not organically grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can taste the fertilizers in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know friends that own hydro shops and I
know friends that are reps and consultants
[SPEAKER_08]: for dispensaries and they go to places
that claim to be running organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when they make their order from
the hydro shop or when they set up a new
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrient schedule with the consultant,
they go with the product that is
[SPEAKER_08]: completely not organic and they don't seem
to give a shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can't say anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got to let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm glad now somebody is going to call
them out and make them accountable.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm going to take a dab and a
quick drink and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: address an email that was sent to us by a
listener about something I said in episode
[SPEAKER_08]: number 90.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hang out for a few seconds and I'll be
right back.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to let you know,
if you hear a bunch of ruckus in the back
[SPEAKER_08]: around there, there are no hostages in my
house.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a football game happening
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Denver Broncos game and my
neighbors are having a party and I got my
[SPEAKER_08]: window open a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whenever something happens in the game,
you can hear them either cheer or jeer,
[SPEAKER_08]: whichever way it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you hear the screams, no,
I don't have hostages here in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a football game and people are
going crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right, just a few days ago,
I received an email from a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into this email and pulling it
up in my phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: This email is from our friend,
Justin, and it says, I just listened to
[SPEAKER_08]: episode 90.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I was operating on some incorrect
information.
[SPEAKER_08]: You and Jesse seemed to feel like herms
are really bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was told herm seeds were pretty much
feminized seeds since the genetics all
[SPEAKER_08]: came from females.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically we would revedge out plants
after harvest and then light poison them
[SPEAKER_08]: to make seeds for the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm wondering if those progeny from the
seeds would be predisposed to herm in the
[SPEAKER_08]: future.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could just explain a little to me
or cover this on the show, I would super
[SPEAKER_08]: duper love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks Rasta Jeff from Justin G.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the seeds you're talking about are not
necessarily herms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hermaphrodite seeds are different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hermaphrodite seeds come from when there
is a female plant in the room that
[SPEAKER_08]: suddenly pops a male flower and that male
flower pollinates the room and a few seeds
[SPEAKER_08]: happen from that small pollination.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a big difference in kind of a
hermaphrodite seed and what you're talking
[SPEAKER_08]: about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took a few notes and wrote a few things
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kind of try to read this to
you and sound like I'm not reading
[SPEAKER_08]: something to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those seeds that you made are made by
stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as long as there were no males or stray
pollen available to the females and also
[SPEAKER_08]: the females are solid females,
the seeds produced will be females because
[SPEAKER_08]: of the lack of a Y male chromosome.
[SPEAKER_08]: So technically those won't be herm seeds
if none of the females hermaphrodited and
[SPEAKER_08]: made male flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They released pollen in there and they
should be feminized.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as long as none of your female plants
are throwing off bananas or male pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: sacks, you will be making female seeds
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: If a plant is allowed to flower for too
long, it'll often make seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: If a plant is light stressed, which is
what you guys are doing, then those plants
[SPEAKER_08]: will make seeds and those seeds are
feminized.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another way to make feminized seeds is
Soma takes a plant that is almost
[SPEAKER_08]: finished.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be around week six or seven for like
a nine week plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll take it around week six or seven and
then he will light a small fire and put
[SPEAKER_08]: that fire next to the plant to make it
feel like it's in a forest fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: He will heat the shit out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll move the heat around the plant and
kind of freak it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that plant thinks it's in a forest
fire and its panic reaction is to start
[SPEAKER_08]: making seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he'll have to give it four to six weeks
from there to finish seeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: But by week 12, Soma will have a big batch
of feminized S1 seeds that don't have any
[SPEAKER_08]: other chromosomes in them except the
chromosomes coming from that plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to be basically copying
the plant that you just stressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you are making feminized seeds there.
[SPEAKER_08]: When Jesse and I were talking about
hermaphrodite seeds, we were talking more
[SPEAKER_08]: about seeds that were caused by a
hermaphrodite issue in a room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Say one of your females were to pop a
pollen sack during week seven or whatever,
[SPEAKER_08]: week six or seven, and that hits another
plant and it pollinates and it makes a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That seed will be kind of questionable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may have hermaphroditic traits,
but it still could be gold is what we were
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a little bit of difference in
herm seed and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: A herm seed is kind of a trait issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're doing is kind of a
manipulation, sort of a stressing and a
[SPEAKER_08]: panic reaction sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage you to keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you got any extra seeds, man,
I'd love to grow a couple of those and see
[SPEAKER_08]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take some pictures for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So one thing that I do that's kind of on
this realm, and this is just because I
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to rant about this, it's kind of
what this reminded me of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I breed with plants, I will take my
females and I will put them in the
[SPEAKER_08]: flowering room and I will set the timer to
1212 and I'll let them flower for about
[SPEAKER_08]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as I see bud set, I will
reverse the timer from 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: to 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will now have them off from 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: and 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: and they will come on at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: till 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: for about five days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after five or six days,
I will put the timer back to the original
[SPEAKER_08]: 1212.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll come on at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: and go off at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll pay real close attention to them
for about a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'll fuck with the timer again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll turn it on for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'll just do weird random shit
with my schedules in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'll put it back on 1212 for a
few days and watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they start freaking out real bad,
then I kind of get rid of the plants that
[SPEAKER_08]: can't handle some stress.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I go light stress testing
because a little bit will tell me what I
[SPEAKER_08]: want to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: But sometimes you get curious as a grower
and you want to go through and really
[SPEAKER_08]: pummel a female plant and see what that
bitch can handle before you go putting her
[SPEAKER_08]: into a major breeding project.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've actually got a couple of plants
that I can take them to week two and
[SPEAKER_08]: totally reverse the light cycle and it
doesn't piss them off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do it a couple of times and they
don't herm out.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if I let those same plants go
long enough without any light stress,
[SPEAKER_08]: if I let them go too long, they will start
to produce seeds because I've let some
[SPEAKER_08]: strains go up to 80 days, strains that
should only go 60.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have let them go 80 just to see what
happens when you grow as much as we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: You end up playing with some things.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you learn a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I let them go a little bit long just to
see what happened and it was seeded.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant had by that 20 extra days put
seeds in my plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can do it by light stress.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do it by extending them.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to stress test your
females, I kind of just told you how I
[SPEAKER_08]: would do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just fuck with the light cycles as
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I want to say is when you grow
out those seeds that you're making from
[SPEAKER_08]: manipulated plants, really pay close
attention to hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may not find the hermaphrodites until
like week eight of a nine-week plant or of
[SPEAKER_08]: a 10-week plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So really pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shouldn't be there, but you are
making a manipulated seed that's not
[SPEAKER_08]: natural.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a chance for some weirdness.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that answered your question in your
email.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and grow those seeds out,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great way to keep yourself
self-sustainable and keep yourself
[SPEAKER_08]: supplied in seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be one of those guys that has seeds
when the apocalypse comes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be hanging out.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, if you want me to read
one of your emails on the show,
[SPEAKER_08]: all you got to do is send it to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love you guys to follow me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love all of the social media
interaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do try to interact with everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you send me a message, I will try to
respond.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does take me a little bit sometimes
because I do get a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I've got the iRegenetics email
account that fills up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got my own personal email account
that fills up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I've been doing Periscope videos,
I've been getting a lot more messages.
[SPEAKER_08]: So things are going a little bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, all that
stuff keeps me tied up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been working at the spot doing
quite a few hours every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that limits my time for social media.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will answer your question is what I
think I am getting to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please interact with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys, I think that's holy
crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to my throat?
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's all I've got for you for
this week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that news article and that email
would take a little bit longer to answer,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I pretty much covered that in 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am putting together the episode about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to get more guests to come be
on the show now that it's almost harvest
[SPEAKER_08]: season, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once everybody cuts down, everybody
will be a little bit more available.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be able to get all the growers back
on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the Zoom H6, so I'll be able to take
the show on the road now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go a few places.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just bought four microphones and four
new cables.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be able to take that wherever we
want and go do some recording with a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: more people.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to open up a lot more
options.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the next episode, I plan to answer
another email that we got.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to address something that I saw at
a grower's house when I went to do a
[SPEAKER_08]: consultation, something that they did in
their garden that I felt the urge to
[SPEAKER_08]: correct them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of gave them some guidance on
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might be making the same mistakes as
this other guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to share that with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a lot of great stuff planned.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I'll be back Monday with another
episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have any sponsors.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to sponsor the podcast,
all you got to do is send me an email.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you know everything you need to
know about sponsoring the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got a product that you would
like me to review, same thing,
[SPEAKER_08]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would love to review your products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you an honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will expose your product to at least
5,000 consumers that are right up your
[SPEAKER_08]: alley.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have a good product,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get it out there for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have something to say find me on
all the social media.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm never going to charge you for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, this podcast will always be
free.
[SPEAKER_08]: The show is going to be free.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grow from my heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it to you from my heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you grow from your heart in return.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you do feel like making a
contribution, it would definitely be
[SPEAKER_08]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just bought the new Zoom H6 partially
with contributions that came into the
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to everybody who has made a
contribution in the past.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you guys, now that the show is over,
you can go to iTunes, search for the
[SPEAKER_08]: iTunes or go to the iTunes store,
search for grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Find the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave me a five star review and type in a
little comment and let me know what you
[SPEAKER_08]: think about the podcast and I will read
your comments on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason that we want more ratings and
more comments and more reviews is because
[SPEAKER_08]: that makes us more exposed to a larger
audience.
[SPEAKER_08]: The more likes you get, the more comments
you get, the more Facebook shares you and
[SPEAKER_08]: exposes you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the more people that see the show,
the more people will learn how to grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: More people will grow quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: More people will quit spraying shit on
their plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: People will learn how to look out for
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_08]: People will learn how to just grow better
cannabis overall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody will grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: People will get the right idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will get a proper education.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe somebody will listen to the show
that has never smoked pot before.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll listen to the show and they'll
say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy smokes a Grammahash every single
day and he's mostly articulate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've got some stoner moments on
this show, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm mostly articulate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll say, this guy has his shit
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe weed isn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then maybe they'll lighten up and then
maybe they'll be on our side.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then maybe one day we can legalize
cannabis nationwide and then worldwide.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my mission.
[SPEAKER_08]: Legalizing cannabis one click at a time
here at the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys, I don't have a lot
else to say, so I am going to wrap up the
[SPEAKER_08]: show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow me on Instagram, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hit 18,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm at 18.1K on Instagram right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll find me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at iregenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I want to give a huge shout out
to my ninja spits.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Until next time, take a big fat dab,
not just a little dab, you guys,
[SPEAKER_08]: like a big one, like a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it count.
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after you blow it out, go give your
mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for episode number 96 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_08]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_08]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_08]: for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm coming at you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even speak today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm coming to you on a lovely Thursday.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bonus Thursday episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not put out a Thursday episode?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the Monday episode was pretty
short.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after I put out the Monday episode,
right after I recorded the Monday episode,
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to go look at the news and there
was another news article that I feel like
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys need to know about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on this episode, it's going to be a
quickie, just going to be a midweek
[SPEAKER_08]: quickie, a Thursday bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to talk about a news article
and then I'm going to talk about something
[SPEAKER_08]: that I saw while doing a consultation at
somebody's house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to give you a little bit
of guidance and help you improve
[SPEAKER_08]: something.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's get into this news article that
made me want to record.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one says, they are at it again,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: This article comes from The Cannabis and
it is written by our friends David Magoya
[SPEAKER_08]: and Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's get right down to bidnith.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: The owners of two Denver marijuana growing
facilities on Friday said they were
[SPEAKER_08]: voluntarily recalling their products after
city health officials learned test found
[SPEAKER_08]: unapproved pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: The recall of an undisclosed amount of
plants and edible products is the second
[SPEAKER_08]: issued by the Denver Department of
Environmental Health in just over a week,
[SPEAKER_08]: underscoring the city's enforcement
efforts on companies allegedly using
[SPEAKER_08]: disallowed chemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Department officials said retailers should
either destroy the recalled products or
[SPEAKER_08]: return them to the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Consumers who have had the products should
return them to the store of purchase or
[SPEAKER_08]: dispose of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take them back, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't throw them away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take them back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get your money back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a replacement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Owners of the two impacted businesses,
Summit Wellness, which operates as Denver
[SPEAKER_08]: Rec, Denver Recreational Dispensary,
and Sacred Seed confirmed they were
[SPEAKER_08]: removing products from their store
shelves.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Denver Rec owner James Monaco told the
Denver Post about the recall.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working through the process and
we'll have a statement on our Twitter feed
[SPEAKER_08]: later tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, is that just an excuse, you guys,
or do you think that that really happened?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think they really had a rogue
employee go in the grow rooms in the
[SPEAKER_08]: middle of the night and spray pesticides?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that pesticide had to be in the damn
building for that dude to put in the
[SPEAKER_08]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It means he had to go to the store.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to buy a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to drive to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to wait for everybody else to
leave.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to mix that shit up, and then he
had to spray the shit up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to call them out and say
bullshit, but I might say that I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: completely sure I completely buy that
whole story because how would they know
[SPEAKER_08]: that a rogue employee did that if nobody
ever said anything until the shit was
[SPEAKER_08]: tested and found spray on it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they just go, oh yeah, that was that
time that that guy did that?
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like they just made that up.
[SPEAKER_08]: The more I talk about it, the more I feel
like they are just using that as a cop
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I want to get back into the
office.
[SPEAKER_08]: The next paragraph lists all of the origin
RMCF numbers on all of the products that
[SPEAKER_08]: are recalled because I don't feel the need
to read all of these numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: 90% of my audience is not in Colorado
anyway, so most of you guys don't have any
[SPEAKER_08]: of these products.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you bought Mahatma products,
you may want to contact the dispensary
[SPEAKER_08]: where you got them, and you may want to
get a refund.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, As in the city's prior marijuana
recall, return products cannot be sold
[SPEAKER_08]: until additional testing clears them of
residues of the disallowed pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: The businesses also have the discretion to
destroy them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in a state of shock, Kilburn said.
[SPEAKER_08]: We pulled everything off of our shelves,
self-quarantined our grow and our product.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't wholesale, so no one has our
product out there except the small amount
[SPEAKER_08]: of trim for processing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The product subject to the recall had been
tested at Mahatma Concentrates in Denver,
[SPEAKER_08]: which was already under a recall issued
September 8th for its own products that
[SPEAKER_08]: had tested positive for pesticides that
state agriculture officials have not
[SPEAKER_08]: cleared for the use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: The city's inquiry at Mahatma extended to
several businesses that send it marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: trimmings for processing into edible
concentrates such as wax and shatter,
[SPEAKER_08]: which are then returned or distributed to
different stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a result of the first recall,
Mahatma began pesticide testing on all
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana trimmings that arrive in its
Denver facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that testing that found pesticides
in the latest recalled products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kilburn said the sacred seed employee
responsible for the pesticide misuse had
[SPEAKER_08]: left on Tuesday and offered an explanation
in a resignation letter.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, I'm so sorry, we had a minor bug
problem and I was concerned we were going
[SPEAKER_08]: to lose the crop, Kilburn said of the
letter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did we tell him not to use those
pesticides, we had sent him and two others
[SPEAKER_08]: to specialize pesticide handlers training
through the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_08]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was unclear how Denrec learned of the
test results.
[SPEAKER_08]: Denver inspectors said they only found
application log books for the past 30 days
[SPEAKER_08]: at Denrec and the business that older ones
had been destroyed reports show.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: A letter of resignation with an apology
and destroyed evidence.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is turning into a cannabis soap
opera.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_08]: The CDA issued a list earlier this year of
products it says can be used on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the drug is illegal under federal
law, no pesticide is specifically approved
[SPEAKER_08]: for use on cannabis, but some label
restrictions are so broadly written that
[SPEAKER_08]: using the chemical would not violate them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Federal law mandates that no pesticide may
be used in a manner that is not consistent
[SPEAKER_08]: with its label.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most marijuana growers are not well
informed about pesticide use and the rules
[SPEAKER_08]: behind them, CDA officials have said.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what appears to solve a problem in a
greenhouse could actually be a violation
[SPEAKER_08]: of the law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pesticides are regulated by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: Environmental Protection Agency and it
offers no information about marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: because the drug is illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we are not able to test pesticides
on cannabis to find out the long-term
[SPEAKER_08]: effect, to find out how long that product
stays in the cannabis, to find out how
[SPEAKER_08]: much of it actually makes it to the
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's illegal to test these pesticides on
cannabis in the way that we need to do it
[SPEAKER_08]: to find what combats our problems because
cannabis is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you guys know where I'm headed
with this, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The solution to this problem, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you guys all want to say it with
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we can test this shit properly and
we'll solve this problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just legalize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can make money off of the testing
labs would make money.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another avenue of revenue right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are more products being recalled,
you guys, because of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mahatma Concentrates has actually taken it
upon themselves to start testing
[SPEAKER_08]: everything that comes in before they run
it, before they do the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are testing all of the material that
comes in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I give kudos to Mahatma.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a bold step.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is a brave thing to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to pay for the testing,
which costs money.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're also going to lose
clientele because anything that does come
[SPEAKER_08]: back with the contaminant and it cannot be
ran.
[SPEAKER_08]: So big shout out to Mahatma.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, if you're coming to Colorado to
buy products, I want you to feel safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is what we're doing to make you
feel safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're making sure there are not ridiculous
pesticides in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they mentioned that Department of
Agriculture applicators training course in
[SPEAKER_08]: this article.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are growing cannabis, I recommend
that you go and read your state's
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide applicators training manual or
certification manual, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It varies state by state, but your
Department of Agriculture in your state
[SPEAKER_08]: will have an applicators training guide or
a certification guide or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go read it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will learn so much about pesticides,
about pesticide use, about pesticide
[SPEAKER_08]: safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will learn that most of these products
are all derived from the same thing and
[SPEAKER_08]: they are mixed with other carrier agents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that alone will be a useful tool in
your ganja growing arsenal.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do in the future plan on doing an
integrated pest management episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got two people lined up that I want
to have on that show and getting them here
[SPEAKER_08]: at the same time has been a challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may just do two separate episodes and
get them both on separate episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the news article that I wanted to
read you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to keep you guys updated on what's
going on here in Denver or up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not in Denver, but here in Colorado,
up in Denver, about a hundred miles south
[SPEAKER_08]: of Denver, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to keep you updated on what's
going on, let you know how this pesticide
[SPEAKER_08]: drama has been going.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to kind of give props to
Mahatma concentrates for just stepping up
[SPEAKER_08]: their game.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're testing everything now.
[SPEAKER_08]: They found out they had a problem instead
of trying to hide it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, Hey, we fucked up and look
what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to test everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to make a lot of people
accountable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like the way that this industry is
moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to talk about one more thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, this is just going to be a short
episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a bonus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursday episode, I wanted to get that
news article out, but since I'm here
[SPEAKER_08]: recording, I want to talk about something
that I saw a few days ago while I was at a
[SPEAKER_08]: consultation.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times when I go to a
consultation, the people will have a
[SPEAKER_08]: problem that they need corrected,
but sometimes they just want me to observe
[SPEAKER_08]: what they're doing and see what we can
improve or make easier for them that will
[SPEAKER_08]: make their cannabis crop come out a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to tell you guys a little
something about what I saw at a
[SPEAKER_08]: consultation with a client a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to kind of correct this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if you're doing this
wrong or if you could be doing this
[SPEAKER_08]: better, but I'm sure that there are a
couple of people out there who will
[SPEAKER_08]: benefit from this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just watching this guy work in
his garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just showed up at his house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you need help.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we walked out there and he said,
I saved all my chores for when you got
[SPEAKER_08]: here and we're just going to do my
gardening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I helped him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I filled some buckets and we did what we
did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I watched him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the first thing this dude did that I
corrected was this guy gets a five gallon
[SPEAKER_08]: bucket and he pours his nutrients into a
glass to measure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he pours all of the nutrients
into the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, you cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will explain why.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not a scientist, but I know why.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason that they're sold in different
bottles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you go buy, I'm just going to use
advanced nutrients because it's the
[SPEAKER_08]: product that's popped up in my mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got a flower A, they've got a
flower B, and then there's like a bloom
[SPEAKER_08]: booster.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's like a flavor booster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Advanced nutrients has so many bottles.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason those are all sold separately
is because if they put those products all
[SPEAKER_08]: into one container, the elements in there
will bond.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we need to add those products
to water and never mix them together
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are very concentrated products.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're only adding a few milliliters to
five gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first thing I'm going to say is
fill up your container that you're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to mix into, probably a five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fill that with water first, preferably
reverse osmosis water, but we can't all do
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So fill your five gallon bucket with
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always fill it with water first,
then add the nutrients to the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mix nutrients without water.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are buffered.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are sold separately for a reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are buffered and chelated and they
are not meant to be mixed in concentrate
[SPEAKER_08]: together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the best I can recommend is to either
mix them into a one gallon pitcher so that
[SPEAKER_08]: if you do make a mistake, you don't waste
five gallons of water or just mix the
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrients one at a time into your five
gallon bucket, but never pour them in
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrate form into a container
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're causing problems already.
[SPEAKER_08]: So fill your bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a pitcher of water from that bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mix your nutrient solution into the
pitcher.
[SPEAKER_08]: Use a quality measuring device.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys go get something from the grow
store or a scientific store.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stuff you use for your kitchen is
close, but it is not going to be as
[SPEAKER_08]: accurate as something you could get from
the grow store and do not use something
[SPEAKER_08]: from the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then put it back in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't use the same shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to have a dedicated one for
your grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to be mixing your whatever
kind of food you're mixing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're measuring out your vanilla extract
and the same damn measuring device that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're mixing up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's tacky and it's unsanitary.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's either going to get you sick or your
plants sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get some, some dedicated stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So measure really carefully.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys be accurate with your
measurements.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it says 25 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's something I should say.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the bottle says 50 milliliters,
probably use half of that to start.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never needed to use as much as
recommended on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: The nutrient companies want you to buy
more.
[SPEAKER_08]: They recommend that you use a little bit
extra.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you don't always have to use as much as
it says.
[SPEAKER_08]: Start with maybe a half, two thirds,
and work your way up from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But measure carefully.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're trying to put in 25 milliliters,
measure 25 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Write it down so that if something goes
wrong, you know next time that 26 or 27
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't what you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: 25 is what you did and it either worked or
it did not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 25 is your number to go to next time
and adjust it.
[SPEAKER_08]: From there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So measure carefully.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I just said, take notes all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should always remind you guys to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always take notes when you're growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only way you know what you did,
what you didn't do and what worked and
[SPEAKER_08]: what didn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're going to think, Oh,
remember doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're growing cannabis, which means
you're probably smoking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: which means you're going to forget.
[SPEAKER_08]: So write that shit down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you've got everything measured,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You've taken a pitcher of water.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've poured your grow A into a small
measuring device, dump that into the
[SPEAKER_08]: pitcher or B into the measuring device.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dump that in the pitcher, all your
additives, put that into there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then clean out your measuring device.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys go clean it right now before you
do anything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go clean it.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you've got a pitcher, dump that
pitcher into your five gallon bucket with
[SPEAKER_08]: water in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you've got five gallons of
perfectly mixed water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do make a mistake, all you got to
do is dump out that pitcher and then just
[SPEAKER_08]: start fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course you wasted your nutrients,
but you didn't just dump out five gallons
[SPEAKER_08]: of water.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to wait for a five gallon
bucket to refill.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're using reverse osmosis,
water, you just saved even more because
[SPEAKER_08]: when you make reverse osmosis water,
there's a lot of water that gets thrown
[SPEAKER_08]: away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's hard to waste water when you're
using reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you've got your bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's filled with your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's filled with water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's time to test the pH.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen people adjust the pH of their
water before they add the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is a fail because you're going to pH
it and then put shit in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once you've got all of your nutrients
in there, every single nutrient,
[SPEAKER_08]: that is when you adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_08]: Use pH up or pH down to correct it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Write it down, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Write down the pH.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get it at 6.5, write it down.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get it at 6.3, write that down.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's 6.7, write it down.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in hydro, you're going lower,
still write it the fuck down so that when
[SPEAKER_08]: you see those plants doing something,
you know if you were right or wrong with
[SPEAKER_08]: your measurement and you have a reference
for where to go to next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't make adjustments if you don't
know what you did last time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we've got our nutrients mixed up in
a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got it properly pHed to about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wrote down how much nutrients we've
used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's time to water each plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, when you go watering the plants,
this is something that I saw my client do
[SPEAKER_08]: the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: He poured the water directly in the center
of the pot, right over the stock,
[SPEAKER_08]: right into the middle of the damn plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're using enough water, that'll
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is wiser and more healthy for the plant
to start on the outer edge of the plant
[SPEAKER_08]: because the roots that are newer and
fresher and growing and searching for
[SPEAKER_08]: water are those outer roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to get the outer perimeter of
the dirt wet.
[SPEAKER_08]: The inside of the root zone there,
the water will work its way in because the
[SPEAKER_08]: roots will pull it there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So think about a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's envision a cannabis plant standing
there out in a field by itself or with
[SPEAKER_08]: other friends, whichever.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a cannabis plant standing there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The leaves hang off of it in sort of like
a tent shape.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think about it, it's like a tent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's protecting the inside of that plant
from moisture.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when the rain hits it, if rain comes
down from the sky, rain hits the plant and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's being brought out to the outer edge
of the plant, hardly any water will land
[SPEAKER_08]: on the ground near the stock of that plant
because all of the leaves are pushing it
[SPEAKER_08]: out to the perimeter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I kind of believe that a plant will
grow as wide as its root mass will allow
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you water the outer edge of that
pot, then your plant's going to grow wider
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's going to feel like it's
getting more water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, that wideness of the plant should
kind of represent the root mass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when the rain comes down, the rain will
drip off of the plant and fall right at
[SPEAKER_08]: the perimeter of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where those roots are,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it'll drink that right up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also, if you water the outside of
that, it'll keep your roots active.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't go dumping the water right in the
middle of the pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of try to water around the outer
edge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you're going to want to soak the
soil anyway, but make sure you get that
[SPEAKER_08]: outer area wet.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the important part, not right there
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_08]: One good way to do that, you guys,
if you have time, and I hope you do,
[SPEAKER_08]: make a little mound around your stock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just grab a handful of the soil in the pot
and just kind of make a little a conular
[SPEAKER_08]: shape, like a mound around the stock so
that when you water, the water runs down
[SPEAKER_08]: that and runs towards the edges of the
pots.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my point is try to get the water to the
outer edge of the pot, not so much in the
[SPEAKER_08]: center.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a couple of things that I saw at
a consultation that I thought I would
[SPEAKER_08]: share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you guys, clean up after yourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do something tomorrow that could be
done today, because when you start getting
[SPEAKER_08]: lazy as a grower, that's when you fall
behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when shit gets messy.
[SPEAKER_08]: When shit gets behind and messy is when
you have problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're growing on a professional
level and you're trying to have
[SPEAKER_08]: professional quality buds for yourself and
your clients and your patients and
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever else you're growing for,
you need to be in there every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to be diligent.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to be on top of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing can wait until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it needs to be done today, you should
probably get in there and do it today,
[SPEAKER_08]: because plants are only alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think about it, your plants are
only alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in flower for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's 63 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plants only live for about 100 days
indoors, maybe 120, 150 at the most.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've only got 150 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not make every single day for your
plant count?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your patients will know it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your flowers will show it in the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be well worth your time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just get in there and do that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to talk a little bit about
defoliation a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been experimenting with defoliation.
[SPEAKER_08]: What that is is just going and taking off
all of the big fan leaves early in flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put two plants side by side,
the same exact strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used a Jeff's OG because it's something
I'm very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tore off all of the fan leaves on
one plant about a week into flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the fan leaves, if there was a
petiole, I cut that leaf off at the
[SPEAKER_08]: petiole right at the stem.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this plant looked completely naked.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was just a bunch of buds up a stick.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were no leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one next to it looks like a big
leafy pot plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: As time went on, the leaves grew back,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went and cut those leaves off again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did it about every seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in there cutting off major amounts
of leaf off of these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It started growing so much leaf toward
week six that it looked just like the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant next to it that I had never
defoliated.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was spitting out a lot of leaf,
but I kept cutting them off.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just little tiny leaves just
trying to grow out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't getting too crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my first time trying it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I noticed that the lower buds got
chunkier.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think it would work that way
because my opinion has always been that
[SPEAKER_08]: those bigger leaves were the solar
collectors that got off the light from my
[SPEAKER_08]: plant that gave the plant energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may have to experiment more with this
defoliating.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've noticed I get a little better
airflow.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plants seem to be just happier when I
cut down a lot of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys, if you have some leaves that
are shadowing a bud or if your plant looks
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit too leafy, I encourage you to
choose one plant in your garden and maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: experiment with a little bit of extreme
cutting off some leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did everything else the same,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plants looked very similar up until
that moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a little bit of defoliating.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys have any comments or if you
want to know more about that, let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just something I was playing with
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought I would share it with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to wrap up this bonus Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you guys for hanging out with
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is a good makeup for my short
episode last week, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of one 30 minute, you guys got two
20 minute episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That should work for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I really appreciate you guys for
listening to me and supporting the
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been getting a lot, a lot of listens
lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell by the website.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just go and check out some stats.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are really paying attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely appreciate it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I would truly appreciate is if you
went to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_08]: find the review section, give me a five
star rating on there and type in a
[SPEAKER_08]: comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know what you think about the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason that I want you guys to leave
comments and give me a five star rating is
[SPEAKER_08]: because that's what moves me up in the
ranks in iTunes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I move up in the ranks in iTunes,
more people will see the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll put my logo up there in the hot
shit section somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then people will click and they will
listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then more people will learn how to
grow quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the more people that are learning to
grow quality cannabis, which means,
[SPEAKER_08]: will mean there's more quality cannabis,
cannabis available for everyone to smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: English is getting hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just going to end this show
already.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys don't forget that the show is
available on iTunes, Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every single episode is always in
forever archived on iregeneticscolorado
[SPEAKER_08]: .com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you check me out on all the
social media.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on all of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on most of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm not on something, let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I'm wrapping up this show.
[SPEAKER_08]: My throat's burning out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And words are getting hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's time to go take some dabs until
next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I almost missed a part.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
ninja spins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for episode number 97 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_08]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_08]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_08]: for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting across the table for me is my good
buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you guys that don't know,
Mike is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been in the cannabis industry,
the legal cannabis industry together for
[SPEAKER_08]: close to 10 years now-ish, maybe a little
longer than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the marijuana extended the time
closer to seven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you that much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recently had to run the timeline,
which is why I know that number a little
[SPEAKER_07]: faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll believe you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike says we've been in this industry
together as buddies.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like a lot longer when you're
trimming time kind of stretches.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've trimmed a lot of herb together.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have trimmed a lot of my herb for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mike's a fellow cannabis activist,
a good friend of mine, and also a coworker
[SPEAKER_08]: over at The Spot Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on a podcast.
That is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I said is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't ask a question or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was no need for you to respond
other than a head shake was appropriate,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it was just funny to watch you shake
your head and think that the people
[SPEAKER_08]: might've heard that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speak the truth, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's a coworker over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about that in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually here, let's just go for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today over at The Spot Dispensary,
man, we had a great moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually had the fire inspector come
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a big moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the last sign-offs we've
been waiting on.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something I was going to,
before I get too far, follow Mike on
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you follow him there on the
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_08]: He posts a lot of good news related
articles.
[SPEAKER_08]: He posts a lot of great topics.
[SPEAKER_08]: That way you can be following him,
checking out his feed, stalking him while
[SPEAKER_08]: you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always fun to know who you're
checking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow me and then shoot me a message or a
tweet and let me know you're following
[SPEAKER_07]: from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet at him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So today at The Spot Dispensary,
the fire inspector, the Pueblo West Metro
[SPEAKER_08]: fire inspector showed up and we've got
these big windows.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did a fire inspection and of course we
passed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to jump right to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We fucking passed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even going to do any hesitation to
that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We passed with flying colors, but here's
the great part.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got these big sliding doors that go
over some walls.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got these giant windows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our facility is set up to be a touring
facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we put giant glass windows between the
tour area and where the plants will be so
[SPEAKER_08]: that the plants will not become
contaminated by anything that our touring
[SPEAKER_08]: people will come in with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also they won't be able to touch the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it keeps us completely compliant and
legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've designed the facility to be tour
prepared.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got these big giant windows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say they're 12 feet tall,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy 12.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are big eight by 12.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're about eight feet wide by about 12
feet tall, big ass panes of glass with
[SPEAKER_08]: gigantic.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're garage doors, but calling them
garage doors downplays them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good description, but I can't do
better, but yeah, it underplays
[SPEAKER_07]: significantly what we've got here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're garage doors made by Kodak and
they are used in the dark room film
[SPEAKER_08]: developing industry and the professional
film developing industry is what I was
[SPEAKER_08]: told these doors are for.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got these grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, in the night cycle in the
grow rooms, we need a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_08]: darkness and we need to have that whenever
the timer requires that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these doors, garage style doors roll up
and down on a little button and it keeps
[SPEAKER_08]: the light out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also, maybe we're doing something
in there that we don't want you to watch.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we can close it down for privacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the workers can work in there without
the tourists seeing that little area.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the fire inspector came and a big part
of those doors is they're five fire
[SPEAKER_08]: safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there happens to be a fire in that grow
room, those doors will pop down.
[SPEAKER_08]: The smoke alarm will go off.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the smoke alarm triggers a drop and
those doors all drop at one time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the fire hopefully is contained
to that small area and we can put it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fire inspector was walking around.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had his arms crossed trying to be
tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the fire inspector has to be a brute.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He has to hold his ground and be a stern
dude, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see the look on his face.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, wow, this is kind of a nice
facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was like checking it out, like,
but he was trying to not show it,
[SPEAKER_08]: holding this clip, bored in his pen,
like a tough guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he goes, what I need to see is I
want you to trip one of these fire alarms
[SPEAKER_08]: right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just picked one randomly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes, and I need all of these doors
to fall.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we looked at each other like they're
going to fall.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've, we tested them all day yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like fine tune this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: He pushes the button and it goes beep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the doors came down beautifully in
unison.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sounds like a train starting up
when they go down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause there's like 15 of these doors that
weigh 300 pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Each coming down on a track and they just
all perfectly in unison.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they hit the floor, there's a
little trigger that stops them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like a hydraulic that makes them just
and they stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he uncrossed his arms and looked
around and he goes, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to sign off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we went and signed our little fire
paper thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was so great to hear him.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you impress the fire inspector,
you're doing something right.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people have worked really hard to
get that piece of paper signed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam was a big help that day.
[SPEAKER_08]: The department of agriculture told us they
were impressed because we are doing what
[SPEAKER_08]: other people said is not possible for a
grow facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other people can't seem to catch on and
figure out how to do what Robert has done
[SPEAKER_08]: in that place.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are doing it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: People keep asking me how long it's
getting close.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys it's getting close.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you drop in the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're ever in Pueblo or Pueblo West
Colorado, this is not a spot commercial.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to talk about some exciting
shit that happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I'm the lead grower at the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens all day keeps me excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: We get to do some fun shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of fun at work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember hearing people say if you do
something you love, it doesn't feel like
[SPEAKER_07]: work all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of shit about my job that
fucking feels like work all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying it doesn't, but there's a
lot of really fun shit that happened too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some 90% THC hash in my elbow
right now and it was only in the shop for
[SPEAKER_07]: like nine hours was all it was on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically the first 15 people to find out
we had it bought it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have bought it had I known it was
there and I don't even buy dispensary hash
[SPEAKER_07]: very often.
[SPEAKER_07]: Employees weren't at work and said put one
in the safe for me and managers didn't get
[SPEAKER_07]: a shot at it and bought shit off and under
employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: First come first serve, deal with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of perks like that just roll
through randomly.
[SPEAKER_08]: This wasn't a topic planned for the show
or anything, but let's talk about this a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to fix this compressor here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to turn up your mic a touch,
but here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make this shit all work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about how people are always
coming in and dropping off applications to
[SPEAKER_08]: the dispensary and I get a lot of emails
on the iRegenetics Facebook website,
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever my own personal Facebook that
grow from your heart, Facebook,
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram, Twitter, whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are always talking about how they
want to work at a dispensary because they
[SPEAKER_08]: want to play with weed all day and it must
be fun to play with weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long have you been a budtender this
time?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're a budtender for a little
while when we had the other dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Going on about five months now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Five months now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has weed just basically become a product
or is it something that's fluffy and still
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing and unicorn shit still?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still unicorn-y.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today we got it at a new edible option
that I've had in the back of my mind like
[SPEAKER_07]: when I see one grab one and it's been
seven years now and I ain't fucking seen
[SPEAKER_07]: one and they showed up today in my own
store.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one sitting in my bag right now
that's going to get devoured here shortly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that edible.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still like you still have a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_07]: At least once a week something comes
through that getting it in, checking it
[SPEAKER_07]: out, getting to tell other people about it
all day just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: What percentage of your day?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going somewhere with this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of baiting you.
[SPEAKER_08]: What percentage of your day is that
unicorn chase?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just titled it the unicorn chase at
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other 95% is fucking work,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not quite.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a spot we're going to.
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, like doing our pre-roll
joints we do like a pound worth at a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's 450 joints and change and it
takes days to go from this is what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to pre-roll to here's what we have
on our pre-roll selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the entire time it's in the corner of
the sales floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have customers all day going,
Oh dude, that looks like the best job
[SPEAKER_07]: ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not at all the best job ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be if you could smoke one of them
the whole time you were rolling,
[SPEAKER_07]: then it wouldn't be so terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: But just, just sit there and roll joint
after joint, after joint, after joint,
[SPEAKER_07]: after joint without being able to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your hands get sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't touch your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's easily the hardest grind at work
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trimming is going to equal that easily or
more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trimming will be a bitch.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where I was headed with this you
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody wants to come work at the
dispensary, but keep in mind after you
[SPEAKER_08]: turn in your application, if we do hire
you, there will be a lot of tedious work.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we had a bunch of people come in and
apply today and two of them came well
[SPEAKER_07]: dressed, clean, appropriate, turned in
resumes, spoke eloquently and will get
[SPEAKER_07]: called, called back for an interview.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy that showed up with lunch all over
his shirt at nine o'clock at night and was
[SPEAKER_07]: like half sloppy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drunk like I want to work here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me the info.
[SPEAKER_07]: He ain't going to work here.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is not going to work there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not getting a call back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get dozens of people a day and
honestly, we're going to be hiring a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of people here soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody in Colorado is expanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's the industry's doubling this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to double again next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, especially if other States don't get
to legalize in 2015 and 2016, if it's only
[SPEAKER_07]: one more state, the industry is going to
triple at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the next two or three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means three times the employees.
[SPEAKER_08]: The spot has, I think I counted 20,
there's about 20 employees.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were a couple that didn't come to
the meeting the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are about 20 of us full-time
employed there right now and we're short
[SPEAKER_07]: staffed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could definitely use a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So turn in your resume at the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your badge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get your badge.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first thing you got to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys go get your badge and then come,
come apply at the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you do, once you do get the job
there, be prepared to do some work.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to just be playing with
wheat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was another thing I wanted to
mention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody was talking about, well,
you guys are just hanging out smoking dope
[SPEAKER_08]: all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we can't even smoke tobacco on the
property because it might look like
[SPEAKER_07]: marijuana on the cameras and we don't need
that mess with the regulators.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we have to be, I think the rule is a
thousand feet from the premises before
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody is allowed to smoke in,
uh, near any dispensary is actually what I
[SPEAKER_08]: think the technical rule is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That may not be true, but, uh,
that's why I don't know if there's a,
[SPEAKER_07]: like you can't smoke in public in like
parking lots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or in public.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as on the dispensary premise
goes, we're specifically barred from
[SPEAKER_07]: having any sort of consumption allowed on
our property by state regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that includes all employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's been just a number of
dispensaries that have been fine because
[SPEAKER_07]: employees had, um, like vape cartridge
pens in their purses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not supposed to have, I can't have
my rig in my car.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: While I'm on the clock, if my car is in
the parking lot at the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_08]: sorry, you guys, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just opened up a fresh drink and I'm
burping it up while I'm recording here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, while I'm in on the clock at the
dispensary working, I can't have my fresh
[SPEAKER_08]: shiny green Toro rig in my case,
in my backpack, in the car so that when I
[SPEAKER_08]: get off work, I can drive over to Mike's
house and dab him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't have it there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if I'm going to a concert or a comedy
show after work, I can't have my rig in my
[SPEAKER_08]: car.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to, uh, I'm a medical marijuana
patient and sometimes my back hurts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I will have to, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I choose to, if I choose that I need to
medicate during working hours,
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to drive home and take a dab,
eat lunch, and then drive all the way back
[SPEAKER_08]: to work because I can't bring my damn
backpack and dab rig to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, like you shouldn't say that,
but people have seen my periscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know that once in a while I've dabbed
on my lunch break.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time I get back to work,
it's like a fucking 30 minute drive back
[SPEAKER_08]: to the middle of the desert.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a little annoying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to leave town every day for work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've commuted much further, much more
shitty jobs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good drive to put on some music and
just jam out because it's a fast drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's mostly highway miles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put the show back on the damn road.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're not allowed to smoke at work.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not allowed to, to Medicaid anywhere
near the building.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, it's when you go to
the liquor store, like is the clerk drunk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when you go to the gap, like fair
point, the kid's probably dressed in all
[SPEAKER_07]: the gap, but like we go so far with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We buy stuff all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like every day there's at least two
employees that worked that day buying
[SPEAKER_07]: something, but we've got special protocol
for it because if it's just like in my
[SPEAKER_07]: car, we can get in a lot of trouble for
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like even if it's in the CLX.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go in and you buy that diesel hash,
what do you have to do with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes in the safe until the end of the
shift.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then right at the end of the night,
like as for we lock the front door,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's employees want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody buying anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we all queue up just like
custies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right at the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it all gets sealed in an exit
bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it does for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't throw it in a backpack or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it's all, it's all official so that
there's no question about us.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've told me not to even bring my
backpack.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, once in a while I'm going to
have to bring clothes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I work in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm required by the department of
agriculture to have a change of at least
[SPEAKER_08]: one change of clothes, like all the way
down to the underwear and socks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a locker accessible because I'm
handling pesticides and other chemicals
[SPEAKER_08]: and things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I need, I'm required to have a change
of clothes, but they're like, bring as
[SPEAKER_08]: little backpack and stuff as you need to
bring here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't, we don't want backpacks and
shit coming into the building.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need it on camera, especially
going to the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, please just don't like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I pretty much take what I haven't said
anything about mine because it never
[SPEAKER_07]: leaves the security desk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I come up, I come in and it gets set on
the counter and it comes off the counter
[SPEAKER_07]: again when I leave.
[SPEAKER_08]: I go into the back and it's like a
labyrinth back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all kinds of nooks and crannies
and there wouldn't be anywhere really to
[SPEAKER_08]: put my backpack anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So your locker, it wouldn't fit.
[SPEAKER_08]: The lockers are only the lockers are
teeny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been back there since the
lockers came in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're purse size.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you got a purse, yeah, that's what
they're for.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're kind of way off topic here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I don't even know what the hell
we're talking about anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some, it was a really good week.
[SPEAKER_08]: People that are not from Colorado kind of
like to hear our, our, how our lives are
[SPEAKER_08]: and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And since we're two dudes at work,
I just, that's one of the fun part dude,
[SPEAKER_07]: people come in every day and are just
blown the fuck away about how regular it
[SPEAKER_07]: is.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many, uh, so I heard another person
ask this and I thought it would be
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting and I was going to talk about
it in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: But since you're here, what's the
breakdown of people, where they're from,
[SPEAKER_08]: like how many people are Colorado folk?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people are from out of state?
[SPEAKER_08]: And is there, am I talking shit when I say
that probably 50% of the people that come
[SPEAKER_08]: in are from Texas?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, fully.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if we do a breakdown over the,
if we're talking about like a year range,
[SPEAKER_07]: easily half the people that come through
most recreational dispensaries or
[SPEAKER_07]: tourists, that's statewide.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Places like Aspen, it's like 80 or 90%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, marijuana is crazy expensive up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get people from Aspen in our shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy expensive in Aspen and they're
down in Pueblo because they were driving
[SPEAKER_07]: through the area and weed maps told them
to stop here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they get loaded up before they head
back to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a city in Colorado where it's way
more expensive in touristy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but easily half the people that roll
through are from Texas and it comes in
[SPEAKER_07]: bizarre waves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like on one day, everybody will be from
Alabama.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next day, everybody will be from
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday it was Missouri and truckers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have a bus load.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how they actually travel.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They come from Kansas and they all come
together and they all, they always show up
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 and they come about once a month.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are 10 of them that show up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a field trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens way more often than you'd
think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like families come through today.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a girl with her grandmother and
her grandmother just had a filthy mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dirty joke after dirty joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the granddaughter was mortified and
they're buying weed together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's, we get shit like that
constantly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grandma and granddaughter buying her
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're all blown away because we have
marijuana stores where you can walk in and
[SPEAKER_07]: just like every other store, there's a
salesperson there to tell you all about
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest obstacle to the shop is the
security guard.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to have an ID that says you're
21.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you got that, go on and buy some,
he goes, it'll be a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he makes sure that there's somebody
back there and he goes, go on back and
[SPEAKER_08]: then you can go buy weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people don't know what to think
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get to spend a lot of time upfront
because I'm supposed to be in the back in
[SPEAKER_08]: the cave growing the weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But sometimes I got to venture up to the
front.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to go find a boss and now they're
hard to find.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just find myself in the bedroom
watching and seeing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a good portion of the people that I
meet are from out of state and they all
[SPEAKER_08]: see the little board with the pins in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know I just gave everybody in
America, like a weird shitty Southern
[SPEAKER_08]: accent, but I'm like, that's our little
map to mark where everybody's from.
[SPEAKER_08]: If your spot doesn't have a pin,
if your city doesn't have a pin,
[SPEAKER_08]: put a pin in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see everybody trying to find the
little spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had two from Michigan today when I was
up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get somebody from a different country at
least once a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people from all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can, we had a bunch of just gorgeous
girls from New Zealand come through one
[SPEAKER_07]: day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like just on the regular people from all
over the planet coming to Colorado to
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're coming through Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say that sometimes I go up front
and there might be some really beautiful
[SPEAKER_08]: women in the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've gotten way far off topic here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, this is not a spot commercial.
[SPEAKER_07]: We spent a lot of time at work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some cool shit happens there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's some cool shit does happen there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's, I've got a news article that I
wanted to talk about before we get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, I wanted to tell you, what's going
on in another realm of my world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been talking about Damsel's Dank.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have not been keeping up,
if you don't listen to every single
[SPEAKER_08]: episode, come on, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't listen to everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know there's other shit to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do your homework to people.
[SPEAKER_08]: My, there's a suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not familiar with the suicide
girls, make yourself familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do that at work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't, don't look at the suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't maybe do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you work at the spot, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: The suicide girls are models and they
mostly are like tattooed and have some
[SPEAKER_08]: piercings and maybe some dreadlocks here
and there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, they're, they're not your
normal cover girl model.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think burlesque is the word you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be the word I'm trying to fish
out of my brain here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the help.
[SPEAKER_08]: All these diesel dabs are making my brain
sticky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I've got a suicide girl who's a
friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: She goes by Duditz Damsel is her suicide
girl name.
[SPEAKER_08]: She works with Green and Healthy Wellness,
a dispensary in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Springs that is now relocating.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are building the new facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you guys are fans of Green and
Healthy Wellness, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll be open pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be announcing the grand opening on
the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, I think we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're on that anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Duditz Damsel asked me to develop a
strain for her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now I have got two, I've started
three phenotypes, three different strains
[SPEAKER_08]: from seed that I'm going to phenotype from
for her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two of those are now into flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are about 48 hours into flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think somewhere around there at this
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in about nine weeks, we will have the
first two test batches of Damsel's Dank.
[SPEAKER_08]: For Duditz Damsel, my favorite suicide
girl.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damsel and I and a few other suicide girls
and my buddy, the Grimy Gatsby and a
[SPEAKER_08]: couple of the Terpy boys and a few other
folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike's giving me the head nod like,
wait, you said a few other suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_08]: The numbers are looking good here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have a tasting party.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably be in Colorado Springs,
possibly Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just hoping on a testing kit for
myself, but fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's, depending on how much herb
there is, you may get a little sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may get a sample of what gets selected
because there will be things that she
[SPEAKER_08]: likes, that I don't like, that I don't
like, that she does like.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I said that the opposite,
but there as the grower and the breeder
[SPEAKER_08]: all like different things in her.
[SPEAKER_08]: For her, we're looking for one specific
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There may be something that pops out of
this search for us that we're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: keep that has nothing to do with her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's more what I wanted it for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to get in on the phenol hunt for
an entirely different reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, let's find my new medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: This party sounds kind of awesome too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The party will be pretty damn fun from
what I hear.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know how to throw a party.
[SPEAKER_08]: John Hunt is the Terp gatherer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just did say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're in flower and like nine weeks
we should have some, uh, in like nine
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks we should have some Damsel's dank to
sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll keep you guys updated on how that
goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, they should be here to take some
pictures and things, pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try to, we'll try to get dams on the
podcast before too long, but you guys,
[SPEAKER_08]: since green and healthy had to relocate
without a lot of warning, they are fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: slammed and busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see, we've been going 22
minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to read an article or do we
want to talk?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's go read this news article I've
got here because I found this interesting
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's kind of, Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe this will help some people out and
this will definitely interest Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike doesn't know what I'm going to read.
[SPEAKER_08]: This will definitely get your attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, the headline says FDA issues
warnings to makers of legal CBD hemp oil
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go and find who it's by so I can
give them credit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's by Thomas H Clark from the daily
chronic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it on the daily chronic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will read the article.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Consumers should be aware of purchasing
and using any such products.
[SPEAKER_08]: The FDA says the food and drug
administration has sent letters to several
[SPEAKER_08]: makers of cannabidiol oils derived from
him telling them to stop making medical
[SPEAKER_08]: claims about their product's ability to
treat disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many sellers of the hemp based cannabidiol
products who advertise their products is
[SPEAKER_08]: legal in all 50 states because they are
derived from industrial hemp have been
[SPEAKER_08]: making claims that their products are rich
in cannabidiol and can be used for the
[SPEAKER_08]: diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,
or preventation of diseases.
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the FDA, the FDA,
which considers CBD and unapproved new
[SPEAKER_08]: drugs said these companies are misbranding
the products and issuing false claims to
[SPEAKER_08]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Often these products do not even list
their ingredients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Consumers should be aware of purchasing
and using any such products.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is important to note that these
products are not approved by the FDA for
[SPEAKER_08]: the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
treatment, or prevention of any disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: In late February, the FDA issued several
warning letters to seven companies that
[SPEAKER_08]: manufacture and market hemp oils claiming
to be rich in CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: By promising cures for conditions such as
cancer, autism, and epilepsy, none of
[SPEAKER_08]: which have been tested by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: The companies who were issued warning
letters appear to be violating food and
[SPEAKER_08]: drug labeling laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: In some cases,
[SPEAKER_08]: the companies could not even smell
cannabidiol or inflammation correctly,
[SPEAKER_08]: the FDA notes.
[SPEAKER_08]: This stuff's been on the market for a
while and it's always been crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, one thing that I wanted to get to is
a lot of this stuff is brought in from
[SPEAKER_08]: other countries because now that we have
got this market, they're doing kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: like what they did with Spikes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They see that this CBD stuff is really
popular and they're just sending us crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be partially CBD so they can write
that on the bottle, but then it's just
[SPEAKER_08]: other random oils just as a filler.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you don't even know what you're giving
these sick kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll finish reading the article and then
I'll try to remember where I am with this
[SPEAKER_08]: rant.
[SPEAKER_08]: The following companies and products were
among those notified by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there are hyperlinks here also,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It lists a bunch of companies,
CancerHerbTea.com of Florida, CBD Life
[SPEAKER_08]: Holdings of Arizona, Hemp Oil Care of
California, Pure CBD of Washington.
[SPEAKER_08]: It lists a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it also says the FDA also conducted
tests of some products sold by these
[SPEAKER_08]: companies and found that in most cases the
products contained very little cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_08]: or none at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are some bullet points that show
some of the test findings.
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't read them all.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the FDA tested two separate
samples of Ultra CBD sold by CBD Life
[SPEAKER_08]: Holdings for its one ounce bottle for $45
on their website or on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of the samples tested, one did not contain
any cannabinoids while the second
[SPEAKER_08]: contained only 0.02% CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the products tested by the FDA that
were found to contain some CBD,
[SPEAKER_08]: the Ultra CBD products contained the
smallest percentage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys are paying for stuff that
doesn't even have any CBD in it,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is going to make me wonder what is
in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a big issue for a lot of USCO
states that have passed Charlotte's web
[SPEAKER_07]: style laws that allow for CBD only
products, but they don't allow for you to
[SPEAKER_07]: get them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially the law requires you to come
to Colorado or another legal state,
[SPEAKER_07]: buy something and then break a bunch of
federal laws on your way home.
[SPEAKER_07]: By taking it home.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, yeah, if you're able to smuggle
it home, you can go ahead and then legally
[SPEAKER_07]: use it, but that's mildly insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when you're Googling and you see,
hey, hemp oil, CBD, legal in all 50
[SPEAKER_07]: states.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even say hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's CBD oil is what this one package
says.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're lucky, you're getting hemp seed
extract.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, you're getting the bottom layer of
whatever oil some company in China makes
[SPEAKER_08]: and decided to bottle up and label it as
THC or CBD oil, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the article keeps going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to finish this up just so we can
finish the whole article.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the warned CBD companies have 15
days to show the FDA how they are
[SPEAKER_08]: complying with the warning letters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Failure to promptly correct these
violations may result in legal action
[SPEAKER_08]: without further notice, including without
limitation seizure and or injunction,
[SPEAKER_08]: the FDA warns.
[SPEAKER_08]: Medical marijuana experts suggest patients
considering CBD treatment to instead seek
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD rich strains of cannabis grown in
states that allow medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_08]: such as Colorado, who also require
independent laboratory testing of all
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_08]: So medical experts are even saying what
Mike and I say, go to Colorado and get
[SPEAKER_08]: some lab tested facility grown quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't have any pesticides in it
because if it does, it's been quarantined
[SPEAKER_08]: and taken away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we're almost to where we need to be
regulatory wise here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going the wrong direction with
their new regulations, but where they need
[SPEAKER_07]: to be adding stuff is in pesticide
testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those regulations aren't up to speed yet
because the testing labs aren't in place
[SPEAKER_07]: yet because the FDA won't certify testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it just spirals because of our dumb
ass prohibition of this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, everybody that listens to the show
knows what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: The solution there is to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just do it already.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the FDA would already be
overseeing all this hemp seed extract
[SPEAKER_07]: shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be able to legally confidently buy
CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's legit CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd know what you were taking or giving
your kid or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is partially like to warn people.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're buying this crappy CBD oil,
you're probably not getting any help for
[SPEAKER_08]: your ailment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, if it, you know, if it's like,
what if, what if it's a placebo effect,
[SPEAKER_08]: if it's working and you felt better,
what do you, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_08]: Should they quit doing it or?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause maybe they're taking some weird
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not telling you to take or not to take
anything, but if something works,
[SPEAKER_07]: it works for a reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows what you're taking guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the advice here is to come to Colorado
or legalize it where you are, fight for
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my guidance is when it comes time to
legalize in your area, don't pass CBD only
[SPEAKER_08]: legislation, pass cannabis, like
recreational or medical cannabis use to
[SPEAKER_08]: where you can consume flour, to where you
can make extracts, where you can consume
[SPEAKER_08]: extracts and edibles, make it all part of
that because just the CBD is only going to
[SPEAKER_08]: work for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: For a very small portion of the medical
cannabis community, CBD doesn't do a damn
[SPEAKER_08]: thing for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I need my THC.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a CBD episode coming up on the
future and guys, I know I keep saying
[SPEAKER_08]: that, but I'm putting it together.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some episodes I can throw
together in like a day or two.
[SPEAKER_08]: The CBD episode is going to take me quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a series.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get several people to talk on
it and tell us how CBD treats them.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mike is definitely going to be one of
the people on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really big topic, folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a huge topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It deserves some good prep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a lot of notes on it already.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug is going to be part of that show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike will be part of that show.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get a lot of people on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just met a few people recently that are
well known in the CBD community.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll help us out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're finally starting to get CBD
products reliably in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got all tongue tied.
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking to the purchaser for the
shop and he was asking us for guidance.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows that we're potheads.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, what should I buy guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he showed us an order that he was able
to get really high CBD products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we encouraged him to do that for the
rec shop so that we've got that available
[SPEAKER_08]: for people as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys try some CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: See what it does for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may help you out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people, it's the miracle.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, it is nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I'm saying, don't go with the CBD
only because CBD only wouldn't do anything
[SPEAKER_08]: for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the synergistic effect is what we're
searching for, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a little bit of THC to make it all
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's all one unified thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when it comes time to legalize guys,
make sure you don't just do CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to give a shout out to the author
of this article.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to remind you who it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Thomas H.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clark from The Daily Chronic, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful if you're using hemp oil CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't make yourself sicker than you
already are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know what you're using.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're buying stuff from a shop and it
doesn't have lab testing, start asking for
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a matter of time until this is
just like everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you go to a store and buy something,
you know what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at the label on it and know
what's in it and be sure that what's on
[SPEAKER_07]: the label is actually in it because the
FDA is testing this randomly.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now we have the MED backing you up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in Colorado, the FDA is not allowed
to, so we literally had to create from the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground up our own MED.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when the first testing labs
were open, the state didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the industry demanding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Patients were beginning to demand it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shops needed to know what they were
putting out and testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day, I was able to take my
product, my finished flowers, my hash to a
[SPEAKER_08]: shop and have it tested.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's discussions of reopening labs to
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so because right now they've locked
down the rules so tight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, part of the thing is that the shops
have them so overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are so few labs that are qualified
that right now, if I wanted to take my
[SPEAKER_08]: product, I'd probably have to wait a month
anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just disallowed us to be able to do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one type of testing and I honestly
can't remember what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not potency, but I can't remember
what the specialty test we were hoping to
[SPEAKER_07]: get done.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only one lab and it's in Durango.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's a residual solvent test is what
you guys are looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's only for hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can only do that in Durango.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're literally discussing who we're going
to send it to Durango.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't send stuff through the mail to
the testing labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of us is going to draw the short
straw and drive like 14 hours across the
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ball parking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I might need a day off.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the opposite of fun, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Steep Hill Halen can possibly do
those same tests, but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't, don't quote me there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was a discussion I overheard a
couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I heard part of that today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we're talking about labs and
such today in one of the offices.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Too much talk about work on this episode,
huh guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what we did all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been like 10 days without a day off.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I think about right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been gone about 33 minutes,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple more things here that
I'm going to save because this right here
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to talk about, I'm just going to
give it a couple of quick seconds here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we don't have to get too much into
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys follow the UFC a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a huge UFC follower.
[SPEAKER_08]: I follow Joe Rogan more than I follow the
UFC, but that's attached.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my third degree of separation or
whatever you're going to call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is something that happened in
the UFC.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a pothead, as a cannabis activist,
as somebody who was part of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: community, this got my attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a UFC fighter who tested positive
for using cannabis, who has been suspended
[SPEAKER_08]: for five years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Five years, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: His career has been put on hold.
[SPEAKER_08]: His salary has been put on hold and they
also fined him $150,000 for failing a P
[SPEAKER_08]: test for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of different reasons why
it's insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was steroids, this would be a little
insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five years is an insanely long amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a performance enhancing drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been shown to be helpful in
protecting against concussions and
[SPEAKER_07]: recovering from head injuries.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys get punched and kicked in the
face for a living.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a thousand different reasons why
this is insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to probably butcher her name,
so I apologize because she could for sure
[SPEAKER_07]: kick my ass, but I think it's Ronda
Rousey.
[SPEAKER_07]: She just independently went off during a
press conference and I saw that video.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only peripherally followed this
story, but she went off for basically the
[SPEAKER_07]: same reasons I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: To misquote Ronda Rousey, but to
paraphrase and misquote her, basically
[SPEAKER_08]: what she said was, if somebody uses
steroids and they're in a ring fighting,
[SPEAKER_08]: that potentially gives them the ability to
hit me harder and kill me, but if they are
[SPEAKER_08]: smoking cannabis, that gives them the
ability to heal themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're smoking a plant that was put here
for us to smoke and we're going to punish
[SPEAKER_08]: people for it is basically what she said.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to fuck it all up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I already told you that, but I totally
agree with her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ronda Rousey is absolutely on the money
with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a petition.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to beg you guys to sign the
petition.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't signed it yet, but if you're
into the UFC and you think it's wrong that
[SPEAKER_08]: this dude's been suspended, here's the
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did give him three P tests and two of
them were clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: This third one was not even necessary.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a news article on the screen that
I was going to read, but I didn't even
[SPEAKER_08]: want to get that far into this,
but it says, Diaz submitted three urine
[SPEAKER_08]: samples on the night, one prior to his
fight and two in the hours afterward.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really going quickly through this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of those three samples, the first and the
third administered under the world
[SPEAKER_08]: anti-doping agency protocol and submitted
for testing to the WADA, accredited sports
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine research and testing lab in Salt
Lake City.
[SPEAKER_08]: Both of those came back clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the world anti-doping agency.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't cheat that P test.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care how bad you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: They see your wiener.
[SPEAKER_08]: They see your dick when you're peeing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They watch the pee come out of the head of
your pee hole.
[SPEAKER_08]: They watch it into the container and then
they fucking seal it themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're wearing rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_08]: The 1030 PM test, however, was
administered by a separate testing
[SPEAKER_08]: representative and submitted to Quest
Diagnostics, a non-WADA accredited lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: That lab's not even accredited.
[SPEAKER_08]: That test came back over the threshold for
allowable marijuana metabolites,
[SPEAKER_08]: resulting in the lone positive test.
[SPEAKER_08]: This company that tested him isn't even
accredited.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not cool with you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: This sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys need to go just sign the petition
so that Nick Diaz can get back,
[SPEAKER_08]: get his career back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Five years for a UFC fighter, dude,
that's like half of your career.
[SPEAKER_08]: You only get to go from your early 20s
until maybe 30 something, unless you're a
[SPEAKER_08]: bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you get in the mid 30s, testosterone
starts dropping.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't take a punch as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fucking knee blows out or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean talking silly and chasing
pigeons?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just destroying people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be neat to see, but I don't want
to have to wait five years to see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the dude should get to be able to
fight.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, this is just another example of
why everyone needs to get involved and get
[SPEAKER_07]: educated.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy doesn't get to fight for five
years because he peed dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people are losing their kids because
they pee dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people are going to jail because
they're selling people pot that people
[SPEAKER_07]: want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we want to smoke a plant while
other people can drink some shit that
[SPEAKER_08]: makes them drive like maniacs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't blame it on alcohol, but yeah,
because people want to smoke a plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not allowed to have the careers we
want.
[SPEAKER_08]: This dude can't fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we all hang back, we all get shit
on regularly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's enough for Nick Diaz.
[SPEAKER_08]: Support that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for joining me, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't want to end on a down note.
[SPEAKER_07]: No?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what positive shit you got for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my line, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more shit to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking for something positive
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first thing that popped into my
head.
[SPEAKER_08]: The positive thing is that we will be
back, or at least I will be back next
[SPEAKER_08]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have a whole nother episode for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about stuff that's
cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in an argument, not an argument,
a discussion with a stranger on Facebook
[SPEAKER_08]: about is holding your smoke a good idea?
[SPEAKER_08]: He thinks you get higher from holding your
smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was his statement.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll talk about other people's
theories, including mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to be involved in this,
we will schedule this for a time when Mike
[SPEAKER_08]: can return for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not going to be the whole show,
but definitely you're going to hear my
[SPEAKER_08]: opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if somebody else would like to come and
be on that, I think that it's not a good
[SPEAKER_08]: idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you think it's a good idea,
message me, I'd like your opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet an email, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me your opinion either way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holding your smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you take a bong hit, when you take a
dab, when you take a smoke off of a joint,
[SPEAKER_08]: do you think it's a good idea to hold in
your smoke for a few seconds?
[SPEAKER_08]: How long do you think you should hold in
your smoke?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you hold in your smoke differently for
your dab than you do a joint?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me hear it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think you want to hold your smoke
or do you want to just in and out?
[SPEAKER_08]: How long do you hold it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think if you hold it for 10 or 15
seconds, you're getting higher?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me hear your opinion on that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tweet it to me if it's under a
hundred and 40 characters, it's at GFYH
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's longer than that, you're going to
have to email me at grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_08]: at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or of course you can hit me up on the
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just find me as a grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're one of my friends, just fucking
text me, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so funny when I get text messages
about the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should talk about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, um, I'm going to delete your
text message and I'll forget because I
[SPEAKER_08]: delete all my messages.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, I'm rambling now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Contact me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know what you think about holding
in your smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that's what's coming up on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you trying to think about more
positive shit over there?
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also rattling through my brain about
what I've read about holding in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause yeah, there's multiple opinions on
this topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll save that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get that out on another episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, let's wrap up the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think of some positive shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some positive shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you read that the CERN, a large hadron
collider was supposed to open up two black
[SPEAKER_08]: holes, which is going to open a wormhole
and the earth was going to be swallowed
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're all going to die.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was supposed to happen on the 23rd
and we're recording on the 24th.
[SPEAKER_08]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: We survived.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't die.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a positive note.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce Willis destroyed the meteor again,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Bruce Willis gets to be the hero
in this story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it would be Arnold
Schwarzenegger or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, he got to be the Govenator.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all he gets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce Willis is just old and bald.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give him the win on this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: He needs something right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap up
the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike and I are fucking chatty and hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: High as shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, diesel dabs, y'all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those diesel dabs made me sativa-eyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Made me sativa everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, bro, I want to thank you for
coming and hanging out, taking an hour out
[SPEAKER_08]: of your day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a new baby at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for taking time away from that
little guy to come hang out with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what that's like prying you away
from him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you want to get back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you guys follow Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let him know that you found him here on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: He likes to know where the followers came
from, where his stalkers arrived from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's easy to tell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when it's 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: and I haven't tweeted in a day and a half
and it's a stonery name and photo,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can assume other times I have no fucking
clue.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, Dabby McDaberson just
followed me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet that's from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody is going to make up a screen
named Dabby McDaberson and tweet me from
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be really funny if that shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I really want to thank you for
listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks again to Mike for showing up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be back in another week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys, I don't have any sponsors for

[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes and Stitcher and every single
[SPEAKER_08]: episode is always and forever archived on
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll never go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do apologize that the website has not
been updated in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: My web guy has been occupied with school,
so we're just going to let him do that
[SPEAKER_08]: when he gets out of school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he'll fix up the website.
[SPEAKER_08]: School first.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to distract him.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all about edumacation here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did say edumacation.
[SPEAKER_08]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's all we got for the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: So until next time, I need to give a huge,
huge shout out to my new dispense in the
[SPEAKER_08]: entire Garden of Weed and Crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: A big shout out to my new rig.
[SPEAKER_08]: She has been named Juanita.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for joining the family,
Juanita.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a cute little Toro rig.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: She hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_08]: She looks really good with the email on
her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, you're quiet about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You looked at it and looked away like,
that bitch did done hurt me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like her.
[SPEAKER_07]: That burniture table she's sitting on is
sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we should.
[SPEAKER_08]: God, we should shout out burniture while
we're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't do any shout outs.
[SPEAKER_08]: A big shout out to burniture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out burniture.bigcartel.com or go to
bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Search for burniture and look what they're
making.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making coffee tables.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making shelves.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making tables.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making all kinds of random shit
that you can think of with the fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: email built into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, you can have an email built into
some random shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one just made a weird twinkling
noise.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that was your phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cooler than the email doing it
because that wasn't a feature that I knew
[SPEAKER_08]: about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your new rig does not have digital alerts,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys, we're getting out of
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to my new dispense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Huge shout out to my homie, Mike,
for coming over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.
I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: see you next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inna di mud, me a pick on the mud,
and me a
[SPEAKER_04]: load.
[SPEAKER_04]: One by one, load up the van, all of the
guns a hit around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it on the plane, the wig on the spine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Money just a bowl like the rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me dust a muggle up the lane in a gold
rope chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and me girl named Jane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bang, bang, diddy bang, bang, diddy bang,
bang, diddy bang, me and me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for episode number 98 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_08]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_08]: smoker, or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or if you're someone
[SPEAKER_08]: who's just curious about the current state
of cannabis, this, my friends,
[SPEAKER_08]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys sitting across the table from me
once again is my good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little bit dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a couple of new rigs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been hitting them like a champion.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hash is working.
[SPEAKER_08]: Working well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I dropped that music right out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't mean to go so abruptly with the
music.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tried to be smooth, tried to transition.
[SPEAKER_08]: We ended up just dropping that shit to
zero.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you work today?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You look like you've been at work all
fucking day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long day at work, but we're
not going to talk about work for all
[SPEAKER_07]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last time Mike was here, we kind of talked
a little bit about the spot last time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were going to talk about some other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to give Mike a big thanks for
getting here because he's a new father.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's got to be kind of rough
pulling you away from the kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks for showing up at this kind of
late hour on a Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of reasons I'm half awake
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll slap you around if you fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may push the mic right into your face
and make you talk a lot because I keep
[SPEAKER_08]: turning shit up and it's not going to go
much higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a lot of great news articles to
talk about you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I get too far, I want to give a
huge shout out to my new friends at
[SPEAKER_08]: Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Elevate Glass is on South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have the exact address in my
hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's five.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say 512 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on the 500 block of South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a dispensary right there,
Altitude Organic Medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's a tattoo shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then right next to that is Elevate the
Glass Shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got great glass at affordable
pricing and they might have super hot
[SPEAKER_08]: chicks working there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, you know, that might be one of the
bonuses of why I like to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't confirm it or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike has not gone with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been there twice and both times there
was a very lovely lady there, ready and
[SPEAKER_08]: willing and able to help me with all of my
glass needs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll definitely be back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a new, I think I talked about the,
it's a mothership knockoff basically that
[SPEAKER_08]: I got there about a week ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just last night I went and picked
up a little Hitman.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a mini with the hammerhead on the
inside and I had to grab it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a yellow logo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen a Hitman like this with
the yellow logo before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought it was super cute.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I picked it up and man, it hits like a
Mack truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm super impressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a, your collection is growing by
leaps and bounds and the new additions are
[SPEAKER_07]: wonderful was the first word that comes to
mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have as many rigs as you might
think because I got rid of a couple
[SPEAKER_08]: through a place to make room for these.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I swap them out with the old and with
the new.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not as much of a rig junkie as you
might think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Master Shake was fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sloppy's got that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you guys check out oil Olympian
arts on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my buddy Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's his glass trading page.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're looking for a new glass or
artistic glass, functional glass at a
[SPEAKER_08]: great price, my buddy Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is now in the glass business.
[SPEAKER_08]: So make sure you support that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So somebody sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start off the show with an email
from a friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of not cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's funny because he starts his
email.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from my buddy Justin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the email says, so this isn't really a
show or a growing question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a matter of personal curiosity.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of Mattis Yahoo?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you feel like his music is reggae or
not?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not really listen to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wondering doing fat dabs from Justin
G.
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin, dude, I want to give you a big
shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You follow me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: You follow me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You follow me on almost every Periscope
video that I make.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great to have a little cult that will
listen to almost everything that I put
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely appreciate you guys that are
my little following there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about Mattis Yahoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike's ridden around in the car with me
and heard what happens when Mattis Yahoo
[SPEAKER_08]: comes up on the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to join in and get out those.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to get there and get going with
him, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit is so much fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned to meditate while you drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just hold on?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of wedge yourself in there for impact
and then tune out and pretend like it's
[SPEAKER_07]: not reggae all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: You put yourself in your happy place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get reggaeed enough at work,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they do play some reggae at work.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about how I feel about
Mattis Yahoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, that's kind of... So one day,
my buddy Ross Christian, who is one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: guys that taught me a lot about Rastafari,
I shout out to Chris, much respect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ross Chris gave me a little CD with one
Mattis Yahoo song on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I came home and listened to it and I was
like, that is the shit right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really liked the flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: The music was good, but I liked the way it
felt.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just flowed really smooth.
[SPEAKER_08]: His lyrics were really smooth over
everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I downloaded more, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found Shake Off the Dust Arise and I
found Live at Stubbs or what was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: That happened to a bunch of people I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was Live at Stubbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the Live at Stubbs album.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I had to drive back and
forth to Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's about a 10, 11 hour drive,
depending on traffic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And depending on how things go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's 10 or 11 opportunities to listen
to that CD from beginning to end,
[SPEAKER_08]: both ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I totally fell in love with that
album, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shake Off the Dust Arise came a little bit
later in my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I got that one right after I got
tired of the live, right after the theft,
[SPEAKER_08]: right after everything got stolen.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, so I went to Lawrence,
Kansas and showed a couple of my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, check this guy out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we saw him at Waka Rusa.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the first night at Waka Rusa Fest
in 2005, I believe, there wasn't anybody
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like 40 of us up front checking
out Montes Yahu.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second night, there had to be 150
people there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The third night, that place was packed,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: He took one night off.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a four night festival.
[SPEAKER_08]: He takes a Saturday off for the Sabbath.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the Sunday night when he played,
it was packed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You couldn't even get in the tent to see
the man anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: So over three nights, he just blew up like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to go see Montes Yahu on one of
my birthdays.
[SPEAKER_08]: My girlfriend took me to see him at the
Beaumont Theater in Kansas City.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kansas of all random places when I lived
in Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I got to see Montes a few times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen him at the bottleneck in
Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen him a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that artist meant a lot to me
just from that time period.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really brings me back to that whole
time period of my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Got No Water was my favorite
Montes song.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then unfortunately, when he came out
with the album Youth, I feel like he put
[SPEAKER_08]: all of his life's work into the Shake Off
the Dust Arise album.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all of his writing for 20 years of
being a person.
[SPEAKER_08]: He put into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he did Shake Off or Live at
Stubbs, which is basically the same thing
[SPEAKER_08]: just live.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then like, all right, now you've got a
production deal and a record deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's make an expensive album.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, oh shit, I already put it
all out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seemed like he had already kind of done
almost like his new stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like the new stuff as much as I
did the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that happens to a lot of artists.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel the same way about Spearhead kind
of.
[SPEAKER_08]: The older shit was much better.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something about music that
whatever drives you to create it,
[SPEAKER_07]: dies when enough money lands on top of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you're like an angry band,
that's where you see it the most.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, all right, you just got like a
$12 million contract.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you still angry?
[SPEAKER_08]: And unless they really start buying just
more expensive heroin or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where would music be without- If you think
Jeff knows a lot about weed, he knows so
[SPEAKER_07]: much more about music.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know a lot about music.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I could probably do a music podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played the drums for so long.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can read and write music.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a lot about music, music
playing and listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I also know about bands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we could do a whole show about that
because we've gotten way off topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But where would we be?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where would music be?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where would musicians be if they didn't
alter their minds a little bit?
[SPEAKER_08]: The Beatles would have never came up with
any of that shit if they didn't start
[SPEAKER_07]: expanding their minds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Grateful Dead would not have been fun
if I was not tripping my face.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a great Lenny Bruce rant
to that effect if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to put the show back on track
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're almost 10 minutes in and we haven't
talked about weed at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Justin, thanks for the email,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You really made me time travel in my mind
when I read that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really reminiscing on those days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Matas Yahu is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a great message.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a positive dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't use any profanity, so it's good
for the kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: He only talks about good stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to pump your head and heart with good
stuff, it is always better than listening
[SPEAKER_08]: to some negative shit that makes you want
to do stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't listen to things like Insane Clown
Posse and shit like that because it
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't support anything good for your
mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: So listen to some Matas Yahu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to some Spearhead.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people around here are into
knock-o.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't get into knock-o for some reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: Knock-o and medicine for the people.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of the hippie kids or all the
dreadlock kids are loving it now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So check that out if you need some good
positive music in your life.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get on to something that has
something to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to talk about... Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to go... I got three topics
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all equally important.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the 30 shops.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got recreational cannabis is now
legal in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we start or end with good news?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our good news.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we've got an article about
somebody getting shot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go bad, bad, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's end on a positive note this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last night it was a down note.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to come up with positive shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then let's start the bad,
bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to go worst first,
let me open up Google here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already got this article saved.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened again this year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is outdoor season and people that are
growing outdoors are sitting outside
[SPEAKER_08]: waiting for thieves.
[SPEAKER_08]: The past two weekends, over the past 14 or
15 days, I have heard of about seven or
[SPEAKER_08]: eight, maybe nine or 10 outdoor grows
getting stolen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that time of year, people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is ripper season.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, or ripper, homie season.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a lot of people in my world have
just wrecked winters because of rippers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They spend all summer throwing their life
into a crop and then it vanishes days
[SPEAKER_07]: before it's done.
[SPEAKER_08]: You wake up, you go out there to water
your plants and guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw something about a van get busted.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it was in California that
was just packed full of plants that had
[SPEAKER_07]: just been ripped.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen a number of posts on
Facebook of security cam footage with
[SPEAKER_07]: people's faces of people ripping plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, if you are in any pot group on
Facebook, somebody has posted a picture of
[SPEAKER_08]: some asshole and it says, this guy stole
my pot plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know who he is?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all over Facebook right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody is getting ripped off.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened in our town.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just get right to the news article
here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got it on the screen.
[SPEAKER_08]: The headline is, you need something over
there, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: No?
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: My brain wants cigarette, but no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you can't do that here.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a vape, I'll let you vape in
here, but no?
[SPEAKER_08]: Came unprepared.
[SPEAKER_08]: Came unprepared.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize for your lack of preparation,
son.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if you take a dab, it'll fucking
settle down your urge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already stoned enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep you slightly coherent.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are half asleep on the show already.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, we can't make fun of Mike for being
half asleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a new father.
[SPEAKER_08]: He worked a long shift.
[SPEAKER_08]: He went home and ate dinner and then he
came over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 11 o'clock on a Saturday night
and this dude's here.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's here recording with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I went to bed at 7 AM, thanks baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got up at 11 and then worked a nine hour
shift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dedicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're fathering it up and I'm here
recording a podcast at almost midnight on
[SPEAKER_08]: a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how cool we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting it done for the people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm running out of time to do things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been dedicated to the spot lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get it done.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're there all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's not talk about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't talk about the spot on this show.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we're here at midnight,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The headline says, before I get that far,
this is from Jesse Paul of the Denver
[SPEAKER_08]: Post.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it on denverpost.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Pueblo police.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our town, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo, the city of Pueblo, Colorado,
the 719.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo police.
[SPEAKER_08]: Teen shot after burglarizing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Burglarizing was the word that I couldn't
say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Teen shot after burglarizing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Burglarizing illegal marijuana grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Investigators say Vincent Duran,
the homeowner, shot at the two alleged
[SPEAKER_08]: burglars.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got anything to say, Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: You looked like you're about to speak up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about this story the next morning
and yeah, it's a horrible incident.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's going to jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of the kids are being charged with
burglary.
[SPEAKER_07]: The homeowner's being charged with first
degree assault.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happens when you shoot
somebody who's running away from your
[SPEAKER_07]: property.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's read the article here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, a 17 year old boy was shot early
Friday in Pueblo after authorities say he
[SPEAKER_08]: burglarized, demands illegal marijuana
grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now let's update the people why it's
illegal before we even go too far because
[SPEAKER_08]: we are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone is allowed to grow six plants of
their own, every adult.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a medical marijuana
recommendation from a doctor, you are able
[SPEAKER_08]: to grow possibly more plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the city of Pueblo, within the city
limits of Pueblo, it is now illegal to
[SPEAKER_08]: grow any sort of cannabis, recreational or
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Outside of your home, in your yard that is
not in an enclosed building.
[SPEAKER_08]: Greenhouses are illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be like a sealed normal
building, like a structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be like in a foundation,
a building with a foundation as part of
[SPEAKER_07]: the rule.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be so many square feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there are thorough rules that you
have to follow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: No worries that happens with the dads.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just plant six plants in your
backyard anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did away with that a year ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Statewide, you just have to have it in a
locked enclosed space.
[SPEAKER_07]: But every city and county and town now
have their own little rules for the most
[SPEAKER_07]: part.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we cannot grow outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy was not following them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so his grow was illegal and he's being
charged with nuisance violations.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I remember correctly, a thousand
dollars a pop per plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's 6,000 in city fines.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus he's got to destroy the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus he's being charged with first degree
assault for shooting a teenager.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd destroy them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just cut them down and take them
inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just about time.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has to destroy them.
[SPEAKER_07]: How, son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be just going to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got to cut them down and they can't
be out there anymore, but it's harvest
[SPEAKER_07]: time anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's just got to chop them down now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take them inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: But had this garden been discovered by
city inspectors or regulators,
[SPEAKER_07]: or if the neighbor called the cops or
whatever six months ago, when they were
[SPEAKER_07]: knee high and there was no bud there,
he would have had to cut them down then
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just wanted to explain why his grow was
illegal since it is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: That may be confusing to some folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: The article goes on to say, police say the
teen showed up at a hospital at about 4 15
[SPEAKER_08]: a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: Friday with a gunshot wound to his right
leg.
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile male initially stated he was
shot after leaving a party on the west
[SPEAKER_08]: side of Pueblo, police said in a news
release.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it was later determined that he
and another individual had jumped a fence
[SPEAKER_08]: into a yard on the 1600 block of Western
13th street in hopes of finding marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: plants in an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Investigators say Vincent Duran,
age 55, the homeowner shot at the two
[SPEAKER_08]: alleged burglars, striking the teen.
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile was treated, released,
and taken to the Pueblo Youth Services
[SPEAKER_08]: Center, where he was booked on burglary
charges, police say.
[SPEAKER_08]: God, imagine how that would suck,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go to steal some weed, you're just a
teenage kid thinking you're going to go
[SPEAKER_08]: jack some blood.
[SPEAKER_08]: They end up shot in the leg, at the
hospital, and then in fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no sympathy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't either, but fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm relieved the homeowner didn't kill
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm glad he didn't die.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad he just got, he was only injured,
but Jesus.
[SPEAKER_08]: This article has been all over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook because our friends posted it to
Facebook and shared it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people have commented, fucking kid got
what he had coming to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people have commented, I would have
shot him again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is your investment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is your business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't fucking shoot people over
weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be growing it legally anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's legal here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just follow the simple rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if somebody's trying to steal those
plants, call the cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they're there for.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why legalization is beautiful,
is we finally get to use law enforcement
[SPEAKER_07]: when somebody tries to steal our weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had a friend recently stolen from,
who actually called and reported his
[SPEAKER_08]: plants stolen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cop asked him, how much was that
plant going to harvest you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it going to yield?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he told him how much it would yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, what would that cost you to
buy it at a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he told him what that would cost per
ounce.
[SPEAKER_08]: He called me and got a price quote.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told him it'd be this much per ounce,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so on the police report, they value
each plant at what an ounce would cost at
[SPEAKER_08]: my shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now those people that will be caught
because they've got video of them,
[SPEAKER_08]: they'll be charged with felony theft
because they took over a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_08]: dollars worth of product.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real beauty of legalization is that we
can use courts and lawyers and cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: The violence doesn't have to exist there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're stealing your shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let the dog out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You let the dog out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make them run.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got a firearm, point it at them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't fucking shoot them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine times out of 10, it's teenagers or
dipshit kids and just flip the lights on
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're going to run away.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a 17 year old boy.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you would have said, freeze,
get on the ground, you could have called
[SPEAKER_08]: the cops.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have dealt with it a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_08]: This dude shot a young kid who was running
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was already running away.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was on his way out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_08]: Taran was arrested on suspicion of first
degree assault and police say he'll also
[SPEAKER_08]: will be issued a summons for the marijuana
grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: He will also be ordered to remove the
grow, police say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Investigators say they are searching for
the teen's accomplice.
[SPEAKER_08]: In August of 2014, a 13 year old boy was
wounded by a man after allegedly trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: steal marijuana plants from a backyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see this is going to happen every
year if we keep having these illegal
[SPEAKER_08]: outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just put it inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're doing it properly, nobody can
smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody knows it's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can control it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can grow year round.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go get a carbon filter and a grow
light and a grow book.
[SPEAKER_07]: Read the book.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the sun is for you guys,
but you got to, in the city of Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you grow and it gets something like
this happens, it puts a black eye on our
[SPEAKER_08]: entire industry, our entire community,
on the plant, on the movement,
[SPEAKER_08]: on everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody got shot over some weed because
somebody was growing it outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for the ballpark, a decent little
grow set up for six plants is going to run
[SPEAKER_07]: your what?
[SPEAKER_07]: The best gear, three grand?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh dude, I can set you up ready to grow
for less than a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like if you went with the best,
like three or four?
[SPEAKER_07]: 25.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much would you pay to not just sweat
for six months, eight months while your
[SPEAKER_07]: plants are out back?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if someone's going to steal your
effort?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for me, it's definitely worth more
than a grand or two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you think about it this way,
if you're growing enough outside to make
[SPEAKER_08]: it worth shooting somebody for it,
you're growing more than you need
[SPEAKER_08]: probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you're growing your entire year's
supply.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't judge you, but think about the
situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're growing that much, you might be
asking for something if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: get greedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might be inviting trouble if you're
trying to get greedy is what I think I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: This dude's going to end up harvesting
enough weed to get him until he has got to
[SPEAKER_07]: turn himself in to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: He decided to shoot the kid trying to
steal his weed and now he's going to end
[SPEAKER_07]: up in jail for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The kid's going to jail for trying to
steal it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's just shitty all around because
this dude wanted to skirt the law in a
[SPEAKER_07]: place where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now let's just change the item being
stolen from, excuse me guys, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's change this item from cannabis
plants to a car.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it goes down like this, everybody's
still going to jail.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But would you have shot at somebody
stealing your car?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling this guy would have.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we had an incident in the city a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: It got a whole lot of press because it was
particularly brutal.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy kind of lived in the middle of
nowhere and had a trash pile with a bunch
[SPEAKER_07]: of scrap metal in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people kept pulling up in the middle
of the night and stealing his scrap metal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one night he got his rifle and turned
all the lights off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the pickup truck showed up and
people climbed out and turned flashlights
[SPEAKER_07]: on, he opened fire and he killed one of
them, wounded another one, held one of
[SPEAKER_07]: them at gunpoint until the cops got there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And was looking at like first degree
murder charges because that's first degree
[SPEAKER_07]: murder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can't lie in wait and kill people
even if they're stealing from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Pueblo people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is going to happen all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just happened in Oregon too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ripper season.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys don't, like that's a big part of
growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be because it was illegal,
but it was always also because marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: is worth a lot of money, especially in
places where it isn't legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can steal it from someone,
your cost is zero and you can take it
[SPEAKER_07]: somewhere where you can sell it for six,
8,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people are going to try to steal it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the people that are going to try to
steal it are shitheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these guys are professionals.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was told a story of somebody who got
into a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: With a polyvinyl cover.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly what that shit's
called, but greenhouse covering,
[SPEAKER_08]: thick covering.
[SPEAKER_08]: They cut a three foot tall slit in the
cover.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a slit, three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they took every fucking plant out of
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did not leave a footprint nor a leaf
behind and cleaned the entire greenhouse
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys are professionals.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are experienced rippers out there
and they're at work all for the next week
[SPEAKER_08]: or two, just taking crops that are
finished.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys get your plants cut down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, if someone comes to steal your
plants, please don't shoot them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really think about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, really think about what you're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not go to jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: And earlier I said, let your dogs out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't let your dogs out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you let your dog out and your dog bites
somebody, you got to put your dog down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that person may shoot your dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just keep the dog in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's really not a great option here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the things that sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Call the cops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Call the police.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just had a guy get shot for confronting
some taggers in the alley.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really kind of anti, you know,
doing anything right now other than like
[SPEAKER_07]: bring in official.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they're there for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just call the cops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't try to be a vigilante.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I always hated the not doing it
because I had weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were so many times where I was like,
I should, and I didn't because I had weed
[SPEAKER_07]: or smelled like weed or it just smoked.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I've had to just call 911 and
say, Hey, there's a car upside down on the
[SPEAKER_08]: interstate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, why don't you stop?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I'm high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, gosh, excuse my throat clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to give it one good one and
I'll be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm good though.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the bad news.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's find.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some not great news.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not great news.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying that we're not going to talk
about the spot on this episode,
[SPEAKER_08]: but guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: The spot will be used as an example in the
following.
[SPEAKER_08]: The spot, the spot passed all these tests.
[SPEAKER_08]: With flying colors, we did not get any
violations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is legit at the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are champions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, the headline for
this article is seven Denver marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: shops cited for underage sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: The byline is police say they conducted
checks on 30 Denver retail marijuana shops
[SPEAKER_08]: on Friday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found this article on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: This article is written by Jesse Paul of
the Denver post.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually first heard of this from our
good friend, Dave Munn.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to Dave for putting me on the
case to find this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nipples are sticking out, Dave.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to let you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this article says Denver police issued
seven citations for underage retail
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana sales during an enforcement
operation at 30 shops last week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Officials said on Wednesday, police say
they conducted checks Friday in an effort
[SPEAKER_08]: to audit any potential underage sales and
found there to be lower underage
[SPEAKER_08]: compliance rate, to be a lower underage
compliance rates.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I read that wonky.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are disappointed, said Lewis Koski,
director of Colorado's marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: enforcement division in a statement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Up until now, these compliance checks have
been a bright spot for the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: This recent check drops compliance to 92%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were at 99 before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Making us look bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: The news comes as a blow to recreational
marijuana in Colorado, especially since
[SPEAKER_08]: the, in the roughly 21 months since
recreational marijuana has been legal,
[SPEAKER_08]: stores mostly have been lauded for their
compliance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Owners and operators have been praised for
their handling of the hot button topic of
[SPEAKER_08]: underage possession and consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Colorado, what they're mainly
worried about is this, weed being sold to
[SPEAKER_08]: people who are not 21, and also weed being
sold out the back door of the dispensary
[SPEAKER_08]: that isn't being documented.
[SPEAKER_07]: Underage sales and product and leaving a
shop headed out of state, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: in bulk.
[SPEAKER_07]: In bulk, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the two things that were really,
really, really seeking to avoid here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They call those the fatal flaws.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the things that will trigger
federal intervention if they get out of
[SPEAKER_07]: hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, just in my world, all of the
anti-pop people love shit like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it doesn't matter that we only drop
down percentage wise to in line with
[SPEAKER_07]: alcohol and tobacco retailers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like all three of those businesses sit at
about a 92% compliance rate, like 90 to
[SPEAKER_07]: 92.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're at 92 now thanks to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were at 99 thanks to Aspen Dip Shits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dip Shits.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were two shops in Aspen that were
busted a while ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: After they were busted, pretty much every
shop in the state got a letter saying,
[SPEAKER_07]: hey, make sure your ID check system is up
to stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing compliance checks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not trying to scam you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're not going to pretend that
they're 21 and show a fake ID or
[SPEAKER_07]: something.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be an under 21 ID and you'll fuck it
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you get stung.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the state of Colorado, our IDs are
vertical horizontal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're over 21, it fits one way on the
card.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're under 21, it fits.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be obvious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you have to look at the verticals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I just had a family member turn 21
and her ID is still good for several
[SPEAKER_07]: months.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got to read the date,
but how it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody go get a little flip calendar
with the, you can't buy shit here.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you was born before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you need, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have somebody up front who's
trained and experienced in checking IDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have armed security checking every ID
that comes to the store.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we turn away 65 year olds all the time
because their ID expired a week ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how strict our shop is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know you said we weren't going to
talk about the spot, but this is an
[SPEAKER_08]: example of what should be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to do it right right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fire inspector showed up and the fire
inspector said, Hey, I'm here to look in
[SPEAKER_08]: the back of the building.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the security guard said, and who are
you?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, I'm the fire inspector.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the security guard said, sir,
can I see your ID?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, I don't have an ID.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the fire inspector.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the security guard stuck out his hand
and said, I'm John.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the security guard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I see your ID?
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy was like, I'm the fire
inspector.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need an ID.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes, I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't come in here and sent the fire
inspector away because he didn't have
[SPEAKER_08]: proper identification.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was in a fire truck, but dude didn't
have ID.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can't let him in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's period.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, period.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the rule.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have ID.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be Barack fucking Obama.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think we'd let you in there
unless you pull out that ID.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had cops come to the shop because a
crazy guy said we stole his wallet one
[SPEAKER_07]: day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the security guard checked their IDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really funny to watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the blood tenders were standing
there like, dude, he's really checking
[SPEAKER_07]: their IDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the third one in a row.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's getting his wallet out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's pulling out his driver's license and
giving it to our security guard.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to whichever security guard that
was.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everyone that comes in gets ID.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your ID is expired, you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not 21, you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every shop in the legal industry needs to
be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not complicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: We make vendors wait in the entry room if
they don't have their ID with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you cannot go back to the offices.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to wait right here in this chair.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we make them wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they have a delivery for us and they
don't have their ID, we handle everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: else first and then we get them.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back to this article.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking a little bit about the
spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We said we weren't going to.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just praising the rules that were
followed.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Washington state, by comparison,
which legalized recreational marijuana at
[SPEAKER_08]: the same time Colorado did, but
implemented recreational sales six months
[SPEAKER_08]: later, several stores have been
reprimanded for selling to minors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Koski said, despite a lack of repeat
violations at any one licensed shop,
[SPEAKER_08]: this represents a downward trend in
compliance that is concerning.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been at it for just over almost two
years now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time flies.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of information in that
last paragraph.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're re-stinging, purposefully
re-stinging businesses that failed to make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure that they're back in compliance where
they need to be.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another piece of information you might
enjoy, dear listeners, is if you're a
[SPEAKER_07]: tobacco or alcohol retailer, the fines
usually about 10,000 for screwing up an ID
[SPEAKER_07]: check.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a marijuana retailer,
the first two penalties you face are a
[SPEAKER_07]: hundred thousand dollar fine and you can
lose your license.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's 10 times the fine if you screw
this up as a marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could close a shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That could absolutely close a smaller
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: That could shut it down.
[SPEAKER_08]: A new dispensary, they could be gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of shops that that would have
closed down in their first year.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have closed down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike and I worked, we met each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We became good friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: That probably would have closed Metamar.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have destroyed Metamar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: A hundred thousand dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have just closed that place
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have been hungry.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to continue with the article
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, when reached by phone,
representatives at five of the shops cited
[SPEAKER_08]: either declined to immediately comment or
said they could not discuss the citations
[SPEAKER_08]: because of ongoing criminal
investigations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously we failed in our mission to keep
people under 21 out of our shops,
[SPEAKER_08]: said Ryan Fowler, owner of the cited
store, Red Eye Relief.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm incredibly disappointed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I must say, I like the name Red Eye
Relief.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like something I would have
said.
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive by two of these shops regularly
when I'm in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost stopped at one of them the last
time I was up in Denver just a few days
[SPEAKER_07]: ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should have stopped.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would have let you in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Fowler said, four employees,
including a store manager, were fired in
[SPEAKER_08]: the citations wake.
[SPEAKER_08]: He added the shop will stop accepting
vertical identification cards and begin
[SPEAKER_08]: using electronic verification to ensure
there are no underage customers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if you're 21 and you have a
vertical card, they're not going to let
[SPEAKER_08]: you in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is nonsense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can fully let in people that are 21
and you should.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're perfectly legally allowed to shop
in your business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with the electronic card
reader.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't look at the date and see what
it says, the electronic card reader ain't
[SPEAKER_07]: going to help you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: It shows your age.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, when you slide that card reader,
it shows the actual age.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you can't read a year, can you read
a number at all?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, there are a few dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you come to Colorado and you shop at a
dispensary, there are a few that run your
[SPEAKER_08]: card through that little card reader like
they have at the bar.
[SPEAKER_08]: That thing does not save any information,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not save any information.
[SPEAKER_08]: It scans your ID and it processes the
information on your ID and then it shows
[SPEAKER_08]: how old you are is all it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are paranoid that that
thing is showing your ID.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not, or that it's keeping your
information.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not allowed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dispensaries are not allowed to track
your information.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that we do keep track of is
oftentimes dispensaries will document what
[SPEAKER_08]: state you were from, and that is mostly
for advertising and just marketing
[SPEAKER_08]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not keeping your information.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to know where you live.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of room for records.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to be a dick about it, but we're sort
of busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have time to even process that
information, let alone compile it.
[SPEAKER_08]: A need or anything to do with it either.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get back into this article.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were very concerned about this matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Healing House said in a statement to
the Denver Post, we are 100% committed to
[SPEAKER_08]: compliance in all aspects of the law.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have had no issues in the past,
and we are taking this matter very
[SPEAKER_08]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: Officials say the citations for selling
marijuana to a person younger than 21 were
[SPEAKER_08]: issued at seven separate businesses.
[SPEAKER_08]: The charge is a class one misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so they can also face criminal
charges, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: The person who made the sale has already
been cited with a criminal charge,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they'll be going to court for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we say we're not going to talk
about the spot, but when you walk into
[SPEAKER_08]: most dispensaries, there's a security
guard up front checking IDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he sends you back to the budtender
who sells you bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he rings you up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's responsible there for that?
[SPEAKER_08]: The security guard or the budtender?
Me.
[SPEAKER_08]: The budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be checking an ID again?
[SPEAKER_07]: We totally ask if we're at all worried
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of faith in our security
guards.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't at all tolerate the security
guard not doing his job perfectly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of those guys are military guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole company is ex-military.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone in that company is a vet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're used to doing everything perfect
when they have to at work, and so it's
[SPEAKER_07]: simply done correctly every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still ask from time to time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a couple of people that come to
the shop that look very, very young,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're both well over 21,
but they don't look it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time there's a new budtender there,
and even sometimes when there's just a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of people there, and we want everybody to
be confident that we're not selling to 121
[SPEAKER_07]: people, we'll just, hey, can I see your ID
again real quick, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to be sure.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my budt on the line.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're way too pretty for jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I really like you, dude,
but you're not worth a hundred K.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or your job.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: This $40 sale is not worth a hundred
thousand dollar fine and my job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the criminal charge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And us being on the news.
I like my badge.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just realized that at the
bottom of the article, I didn't see this
[SPEAKER_08]: when I skimmed through this the first
time, all of the shops are listed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So avoid them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you're not 21, go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it says, those dispensaries need to be
held accountable, said Tyler Henson,
[SPEAKER_08]: president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber
of Commerce.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your job as an owner and operator is to
ensure your employees are readily trained.
[SPEAKER_08]: That can't happen again, he added.
[SPEAKER_08]: Henson said employers and their employees
need to understand what's at stake here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Officials say the violations can mean a
license suspension, a fine per individual
[SPEAKER_08]: violation, a fine in lieu of suspension up
to $100,000 and a license revocation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, that sounds so serious when he put it
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, think about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did the one shop down here do that
got their license pulled?
[SPEAKER_07]: On-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: On-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't like they were giving out
dabs in the mud room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had roaches in an employee bathroom
and it was enough for them to lose two
[SPEAKER_07]: store licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Underage sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't closed the shop that I know
of yet, but I don't think any of the cases
[SPEAKER_07]: that have screwed this up have gone
through that process completely yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time will tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: My guess is a couple of people are going
to lose their license.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get stung twice, I would bet on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, twice.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it says sanctions may also include
restrictions on the license, police said
[SPEAKER_08]: in a news release.
[SPEAKER_08]: Investigators say they will file the cases
with the Denver City Attorney's Office,
[SPEAKER_08]: which could issue its own discipline
ranging from license suspension to license
[SPEAKER_08]: revocation.
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the Colorado Department of
Revenue, the Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_08]: Division has conducted 172 compliance
checks since January 1st of 2014 and found
[SPEAKER_08]: 16 total violations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it goes on to say Denver marijuana
shops were cited where citations were
[SPEAKER_08]: issued, and then it lists them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the Herbal Cure on South Logan
Street, the Healing House on South
[SPEAKER_08]: Downing, Pure Medical Dispensary on 40th
Avenue, La Contes Clone Bar and Dispensary
[SPEAKER_08]: on East 7th.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's over by where they host the
Cannabis Cup, Herbs for You on East 9th,
[SPEAKER_08]: Mile High Green Cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those guys have a Cannabis Cup,
so does La Contes.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a couple of places on here that
have Cannabis Cups, that are
[SPEAKER_08]: professionals, that have a reputation,
that are fucking up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how the fuck some of these
shops mess this up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Eye Relief on South Cherokee Street.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we can chalk a couple of them up
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been not old enough and gotten into
clubs just by handing the bouncer an ID
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my ID that said I was not 21,
and he's like, oh, you got an ID here,
[SPEAKER_08]: and just hands it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you said, some people aren't fucking
smart enough to read an ID to figure out
[SPEAKER_08]: that 1970 whatever means you're this how
old.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people can't do that math in
their head sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can give a couple of those just to
dumb employees.
[SPEAKER_08]: One or two is probably just somebody
letting somebody slip through,
[SPEAKER_08]: just needing to make a sale.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is, but if selling to
people under 21 is part of your business
[SPEAKER_07]: model, you can go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're trying to set a positive
standard here and do things correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're literally front and center on the
world stage when other nations bring up
[SPEAKER_07]: marijuana legalization as an idea or a
concept that they might want to pursue.
[SPEAKER_07]: They discuss what's happening in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we are the mom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every now and then I hear about someone
from France or London coming through
[SPEAKER_07]: Pueblo and taking a look at what we're
doing here in Pueblo, which this never
[SPEAKER_07]: would have happened five years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason for any of these people
to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And be interested in what we're doing with
their coming here to see how marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: legalization works in practice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they see teenagers waiting in line,
it's not going well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to spread and it should.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys, we've got one more
article that I want to get in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been going for close to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can get this one in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people seem to like, when I've got
somebody else with me, they'll listen a
[SPEAKER_08]: little longer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what it's just me, about 36 minutes is
the limit.
[SPEAKER_08]: When there's two of us, they'll listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good news times, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's start this one off with a big
congratulations to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the club, Oregon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon enters recreational era with tax
free pot sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: October 1st documented the beginning of
recreational pot sales in the state of
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a lot of friends out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: A big shout out to my Oregon crew,
the PNW crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys are out there enjoying
recreational cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got an article, once again,
from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was written by Jonathan J.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooper and Bob C.V.
[SPEAKER_08]: of the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a cool pair of names,
Jonathan J.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooper and Bob C.V.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just when I think I was going to ready for
another dab, you say some really high shit
[SPEAKER_07]: and remind me why that's probably not a
great idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to take a dab?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's celebrate Oregon's recreational
cannabis by taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Consider my arm twisted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll twist the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got two rigs on the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you hit the e-nail and then I'll
go ahead and take the one that requires a
[SPEAKER_08]: torch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a dab over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take myself a medium,
medium dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, I want you to take a dab with
me, first of all, but then I want you to
[SPEAKER_08]: find me on social media, either Facebook
or Twitter, or you can even email me if
[SPEAKER_08]: you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to know how big of a dab do you
take?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you take a 0.1?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you take a 0.2?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you take a 0.3?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you take 0.4?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you do a fucking half gram dab?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's growfromyourheart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you want to search me out on
Twitter, find me on the little Twitter,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know how big of a dab you prefer to
take.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're looking for regular dab size,
not this one time my friend dared me to
[SPEAKER_08]: take a... Well, I want to know,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're about to just pull off a dab for
yourself, if it's your normal day,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're dabbing, I want to know what you
pull off, what your average, and then tell
[SPEAKER_08]: me how many of those you take in a dab
session also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you take a half gram and you
only take one of them, then that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you take 5.1s, that's cool also.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to know how you do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_08]: I myself like to take a whole bunch of
0.3s.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like 0.3 is about where I like to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like to take a bunch of like about
six or seven of them sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: On a lunch break, I'll take 3.3s is what I
like for a lunch break.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now I'm hitting the hit man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that hits really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all remember how bad I cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: No cough.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little cough.
[SPEAKER_08]: So recently I picked up a mothership
knockoff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really, it looks just like a
mothership Klein, but it was...
[SPEAKER_07]: It's thinner, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: The glass may be a little thinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not so much the glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, maybe a little bit the glass
way too, but the overall size of the rig,
[SPEAKER_07]: the cylinder going up is thinner in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be a little bit shrunken of a ship,
but it was a fifth of the price of a
[SPEAKER_08]: mothership.
[SPEAKER_07]: It hits like a truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hits a great rig.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to Elevate in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've said that once or twice this
show, but I've been buying a lot of glass
[SPEAKER_08]: from them and I appreciate the hookups.
[SPEAKER_08]: This little hit man hits like a goddamn
truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to act like I'm not trying to
choke and trying to act like I've got my
[SPEAKER_08]: breath together and everything,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's almost no resistance.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's straight from nailed along.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some choke is just expected.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just get a fat rip every time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel like I'm getting my brains back
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you guys, when I take a big dab,
it sounds like Charlie Brown's,
[SPEAKER_08]: the adults in the Charlie Brown cartoons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what it sounds like after a big dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it takes me a minute to dig
through that hole, but I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're celebrating Oregon having
recreational sales of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the cool kids now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into this article.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from Portland, Oregon,
and it says excited shoppers looking to
[SPEAKER_08]: score some of the first recreational
marijuana sold legally in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_08]: bought up baggies of bud early Thursday,
taking advantage of door buster prices and
[SPEAKER_08]: other deals.
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's such a poetic opening line for a
news article.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever wrote this is majestic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the more than 250 dispensaries
that already offer medical marijuana in
[SPEAKER_08]: the state welcomed recreational users soon
after midnight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just moments after it became legal to sell
to anyone who is at least 21.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really long sentences in this
article.
[SPEAKER_08]: So much for the majesty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: At Shango Premium Cannabis in Portland,
co-founder Shane McKee said the first sale
[SPEAKER_08]: came about a minute after midnight and
many others quickly followed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's not only historical for folks
in Oregon, but nationwide.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime people started selling that as an
alternative to alcohol or tobacco,
[SPEAKER_08]: he said in a telephone interview,
Brad Sussman, co-owner of Canna Daddies in
[SPEAKER_08]: Portland said more than 90 customers
bought pot in the first two hours after
[SPEAKER_08]: the store opened at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: So people were out there at midnight
buying weed out there at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: buying weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like when a new video game goes on
sale, something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lines out the door.
[SPEAKER_08]: People just buying weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm torn with this story.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I'm elated that another state is
joining the legalization ranks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad they're celebrating.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad people came out and that the
lines were good.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of medical shops are converting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So supply might not be the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been another legal states,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, it's time to knock
off the shenanigans and step all the way
[SPEAKER_07]: up into the legal industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to put your best foot forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to fuck it up for everyone?
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were a couple of things about
the rollout in Oregon that could fuck it
[SPEAKER_07]: up for most of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Half of the state has banned shops,
period.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other half of the state allows a
shitload.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at a map, it's like right
down the fucking mountain range in the
[SPEAKER_07]: middle of the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: The coast side approves in their shops
everywhere, the other side of the mountain
[SPEAKER_07]: range, not a single shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: And stuff like opening at midnight when
there are hours that you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_07]: open and not allowed to be open and they
don't involve 1201 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the main reporter covering
marijuana out there that I follow on
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of her colleagues was handed marijuana
gummies outside of the shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Waiting in line doing news reports.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just handed free pot candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pot edibles, specifically candy,
are fucking banned.
[SPEAKER_07]: So are giveaways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like this stuff is world
ending or shattering.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's three strikes on day one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a celebration.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shenanigans happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a truck driving up and down the
street, not at all affiliated with the
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary we were waiting in line at on
January 1st that was giving out plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the funniest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy in a truck, he drove by and threw
out bags of edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: He drove by and gave out plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm 90% sure it was somebody advertising
for another shop that was not at all
[SPEAKER_07]: getting business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it might've just been one of us who
had blown his stack with joy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could have gone either way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get up close and investigate
because I didn't want to lose my awesome
[SPEAKER_07]: spot in line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because by then I was halfway through a
two hour line.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's some shenanigans to be
expected, but it's day four or seven now
[SPEAKER_07]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever this is going to air,
we've had a week now, every ID gets
[SPEAKER_07]: checked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every rule gets followed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a problem with the rule,
get a lobbyist and get a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Change the rules at the state level so
that they work better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should already have a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't just fucking skirt it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Different kind of lawyers.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's really important now that
if you're in the legal industry that you
[SPEAKER_07]: step all the way up, we have to put our
best foot forward right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every state, you guys, every state and
every upcoming state this applies to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the medical shops in California had it
all tried to put their best foot forward
[SPEAKER_07]: ever from 1996 till now, it would've been
fucking legal a decade ago, bitches.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, just like in Colorado,
we had to deal with Dr. Reefer.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Boulder city council right now is
talking about dialing regulations back
[SPEAKER_07]: down to reality because we've gotten rid
of, and I fucking quote, the Dr. Reefer's
[SPEAKER_07]: of this world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're done now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all out of business talking about
how they used to own a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't even know that one of my buddies
owned a shop called Dr. Reefer in Colorado
[SPEAKER_08]: Springs, do you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the kid that used to sell us the
Hindu Kush?
[SPEAKER_08]: Vaguely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Reefer.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a, the Dr. Reefer in question is
the one up in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a twirling sign guy and that's what
everyone in Boulder was fired up about.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is wildly inappropriate twirling sign
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can't have twirling sign guys in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're specifically banned because of
this buck.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can twirling sign for your tax return
place.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can twirling sign for cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can twirling sign for El Pollo Loco,
but not for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can for your vape shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're way off topic here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get, this article has more
words written in it and they say,
[SPEAKER_08]: he said, customers told them they've been
waiting all their lives for a moment like
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_08]: They expected to sell $60,000 worth of
marijuana throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were no reports of arrests or other
problems involving the early sales in the
[SPEAKER_08]: state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those stores planned to open later in the
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon is one of four states that have
legalized the sale of recreational
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Business began in Oregon with far more
dispensaries than did Colorado or
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington state where pot shops have been
up and running for more than a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alaska could begin retail sales next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to Charlo Green,
Foster Buds PDX.
[SPEAKER_07]: She might be going to jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been following that story?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, she has not, or I have not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her outfit keeps getting raided because as
you said, shops not till late.
[SPEAKER_08]: Charlo, take care of yourself.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't end up in jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need you out there fighting the good
fight for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_08]: Foster Buds PDX in Portland had a couple
hundred customers since opening just after
[SPEAKER_08]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shop manager Ken Martin said, it's just
been a steady flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, adding that employees repeatedly
refilled jars with pot to meet the demand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two customers came in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just keep filling those jars.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get used to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Writing down how much came out of the bag,
which bag number, which jar it went into.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've watched it a billion times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two customers who came in had just turned
21.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, Davia Fleming.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I read your name right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Davia Fleming of Portland, the first buyer
in McKee's store said the atmosphere was
[SPEAKER_08]: upbeat for the launch of the new industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the end of prohibition said Fleming
who uses the drug for medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have I ever mentioned that I was
the first person to buy recreational
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis at the Green Riverside dispensary
in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was first bitches.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I'm pretty sure I talked about
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like way long time ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: The store offered its first 25 customers,
35 to 40% discounts and was handing out
[SPEAKER_08]: soda, coffee, juice and other
refreshments.
[SPEAKER_08]: McKee said many stores in Oregon were
trying to lure customers with extended
[SPEAKER_08]: hours, food giveaways and discounted
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shoppers who have shoppers have one more
incentive to buy early and often under
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Popper purchases will be tax free until
January, the savings of up to 20%.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give people to come in and see how it goes
and then start charging tax.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing I really like about Oregon's
law is they're really looking to kick the
[SPEAKER_07]: black market and the balls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So no taxes for the first little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's the old street theory
that they threw at us in middle school in
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to taste the cheap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a free joint?
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the quality control.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the quality increases.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the guy being here on time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll hit you in the nuts with the taxes
manana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting to get hooked.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more watching how it's made for two
hours so that it doesn't look like foot
[SPEAKER_07]: traffic.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just walk in, have your mind blown with
awesome weed product and then bounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The article goes on to say, store owners
say they're hopeful.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can avoid the shortages and price
spikes that followed the start of legal
[SPEAKER_08]: sales last year in Washington and
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alaska could begin retail sales next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I already read that, huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: One store offered a goodie bag with
t-shirts, but no free marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another will have a live band and 10%
discounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Several stores have erected billboards in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_08]: A shop in Merlin is advertising on the
radio.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to basically stock up for
maybe four or five times what the normal
[SPEAKER_08]: volume would be, said Chris Byers,
owner of River City Dispensary in Merlin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Customers can buy as much as seven grams
at a time of dried marijuana flower and
[SPEAKER_08]: leaf, the part that's generally smoked,
plus plants and seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully there's not a lot of leaf in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically buds is what they mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the people that write weed
articles need to hang out with some weed
[SPEAKER_08]: heads.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the next year or so, pot-infused
candy, cookies, oils, and lotions will be
[SPEAKER_08]: available only to people with medical
marijuana cards as the state works on
[SPEAKER_08]: retail regulations for those products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon has a robust supply system that has
supported medical marijuana users and the
[SPEAKER_08]: black market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Companies have invested in massive
warehouses in Portland to grow the drug
[SPEAKER_08]: indoors, and southern Oregon has some of
the nation's best conditions for outdoor
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Growers don't face strict regulations yet,
so the supply can more easily flow into
[SPEAKER_08]: retail stores than it did in Washington
and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still, there is concern.
[SPEAKER_08]: Summer has historically been a time of
marijuana shortages in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_08]: and most of the outdoor crop that is ready
to harvest... Sorry, I skipped a word
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not commercial, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Said Jeremy Pratt.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, we kind of have a seasonal
growing market here in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_08]: said the owner of Nectar Cannabis,
which has four stores in Portland.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have lots of products in the fall,
and then it kind of gets tight this time
[SPEAKER_08]: of year anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reno Oasis, which has two locations in
Portland and more on the way, has prepared
[SPEAKER_08]: by trying to cultivate strong
relationships with growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will entice customers Thursday evening
with an outdoor band and offer 10%
[SPEAKER_08]: discounts to those who spend at least $40,
Cohen or Matthew Schwimmer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Schwimmer said, we don't know of anyone
else doing a band, and we thought it was a
[SPEAKER_08]: good idea to give back to the community,
Schwimmer said.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the article, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big congratulations to the state of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have now got recreational cannabis
sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is tax-free until January.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're doing the circuit,
make sure you go stop in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you get yourself... Is that
where the fucking donut shop is that
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody talks about?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where those donuts are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get some tasty donuts, and then go get
yourself some recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to donuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't eaten too many donuts lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to donuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get yourself some recreational cannabis
in the state of Oregon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, make sure you're 21, and make sure
they check your ID.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they don't check your ID,
call them out on it and tell them that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're not following the rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to fuck it up for the
future.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you listen to the show and you haven't
had a chance to legally purchase cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: start saving for a plane ticket.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're 21.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're 21.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're 21.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just change your world.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I think of what I used to deal with
to buy weed, what was just standard when I
[SPEAKER_07]: was in high school and in college and then
in my 20s, it was just a nightmare,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially in retrospect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just life when it was happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mind watching how it's made that
much.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that it's totally legal and I work
in a pot shop and it's just picking up a
[SPEAKER_07]: cheeseburger on the way home, it's so...
[SPEAKER_07]: So much better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was afraid of it at first.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't adequately put it into words.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I came from the black market and I
was afraid of all of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I don't know, freaky to a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a huge change.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you live in a non-legal state,
you worry about... I don't know how much
[SPEAKER_08]: weed you buy, but when half of it is gone,
you start thinking about, fuck,
[SPEAKER_08]: where am I going to get more weed?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's no reliable spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I never have to think, where am I going to
get my next bag of weed?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if I don't grow it, I can go to
the shop in which I work, or I can drive
[SPEAKER_08]: to one of my other buddy's shops,
or I can drive to one of my other friend's
[SPEAKER_08]: shops, or I'm also a medical marijuana
patient.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I could drive to a medical... This
Spencer, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to burp.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can drive to a medical marijuana shop
and get whatever cannabis I need in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is a little bit better that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: It made her more available, way more
available.
[SPEAKER_08]: It made weed more...
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Legalization is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do so many things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never had trouble finding pot before in
my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It never came up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have trouble locating good pot or
the same pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was always horse shit, whatever you
bought.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was never what they said it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd ask, do you have any of this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'd go, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'd go get a handful of something
different and be like, this is the name
[SPEAKER_07]: you said.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you just believed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the best you had.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully you weren't getting cheated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was just life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's 10 stores within a 15 minute
drive from both our homes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's pretty much true across
Colorado at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can go to two or three of them and
see what you do and don't like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every shop's got different pricing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every shop's got a different selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are major companies across Colorado
where you can kind of find their stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of like Coke and Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to go to a Coca Cola store.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Chiba Chews for example.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chiba Chews, Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in almost every shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Edipure.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a handful of major edible
companies that are everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel bad for the delivery people.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dixie.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a bunch of them and it's just
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You walk in and there's 30, 40.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sometimes only five or six,
but there's a selection of buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to look at them, smell them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to know the price.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not weird that you drove to someone's
house and spent 20 minutes in their living
[SPEAKER_07]: room and you don't want to buy this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just thanks and leave.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to a dispensary and you don't
like what's in there, you can leave.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to buy anything there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: People ask me what the minimum purchase is
and it's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't want any of this,
please, you don't have to buy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll show you around everything and you
can leave knowing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then go look at a few other places.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Half the time when you do that,
I give you a coupon book with everybody in
[SPEAKER_07]: the town listed.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give you something to do for the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, don't feel obligated to buy
something if you're in a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_08]: you don't like what you see.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your money.
[SPEAKER_08]: You work for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not wasting their time.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a store.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go in there and do what you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a marijuana fan, you're going to
like what you see in almost any shop you
[SPEAKER_07]: go to, especially if it's the first shop
you go to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in Colorado Springs hiking one day
and I had a friend with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had hash with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just travel with dads.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't usually take flowers with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys that aren't Colorado
connoisseurs, we call the buds,
[SPEAKER_08]: we just call it flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't have any flowers with me and
somebody wanted to smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're driving and I was like,
look, a dispensary and we pull up,
[SPEAKER_08]: dude, I would not smoke anything in that
fucking place.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could not have paid me to smoke
anything in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I fucking left.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, no, no, thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, it all smells exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's no difference on any of these
strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was, yeah, I just left.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't need anything out of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've left many a shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some of them aren't up to par.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them only still exist because
enough of the population legitimately had
[SPEAKER_07]: to stop smoking weed 30 years ago because
it was too risky for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And only now that they're retiring and
that their kids are grown, are they
[SPEAKER_07]: getting out and trying to buy weed again?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for 30 years, they didn't know who
to call.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're too worried about asking their
friends and neighbors about losing their
[SPEAKER_07]: jobs or custody of their kids or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they just didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they can just pull up to a shop,
walk in, ask for an aid.
[SPEAKER_07]: A ton of the people I talk to every day
have super silver hair and huge smiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been working outside of the shop
lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: My job that I've been doing is just
required some cleaning of some shit that's
[SPEAKER_08]: taken about a week.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been out in the back with the
door open.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see a lot of people walk by because
there's a parking area over there and they
[SPEAKER_08]: walk by me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the people that I see are older
folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a lot of young punks buying weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's older folks that used to smoke back
in the day, like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_08]: that have kids that are in college now.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, yeah, you see them come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see a 20 something college kid come in
with his mom or his dad and they go buy
[SPEAKER_08]: weed together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's really funny to see that
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the 21, 22 year old people I see
are on family vacation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a lot of younger people too,
but definitely the tourist economy is
[SPEAKER_07]: retirees.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're 22, there's no reason to fly to
Colorado to buy weed except for the
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoyment of buying legal cannabis and
getting to see what the selection and the
[SPEAKER_07]: hype's all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know, 30 people were happy to
sell you a bag of weed or at least one or
[SPEAKER_07]: two.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason to come here and spend
the money on the flight for what you can
[SPEAKER_07]: do at home already.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're 65, there's still a lot of
risk in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's none here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just blows people away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear that at least twice, three times a
week.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, where I'm from, this is really frowned
upon.
[SPEAKER_07]: We would get in so much trouble for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone would think bad about us if they
knew that we were here doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, please don't tell my friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, lady, you're from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know none of your people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to call your congregation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're like, watch the security
footage.
[SPEAKER_07]: You bought a chocolate bar with weed in
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, if you come here and you get
some weed, don't try to take it home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't take it home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smoke it all here.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can't finish it, call me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can drop it off at my spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of locals that are happy
to help you finish the bag you
[SPEAKER_07]: overpurchased.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is legal to give your weed away to
somebody who is over 21.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got cannabis and you bought it
in Colorado and you're about to get on the
[SPEAKER_08]: flight and you're about to fly home or
you're about to drive back across the
[SPEAKER_08]: border, stop at the last gas station in
Colorado before you hit the border.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or while you're at the airport,
you see some dude with some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try not to give it to someone who's at
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's me, because I can take weed
and I can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have dreadlocks, that last
statement doesn't apply.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're walking through the airport and
you got extra weed on you and you see
[SPEAKER_08]: somebody with dreadlocks, they just flew
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: They need some weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hand them your bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the guy that works at McDonald's really
wants your unfinished bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: He could really use that kind of charity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sort of pat on the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you give it to him at the
drive-through window, he's going to get
[SPEAKER_07]: fired.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were trying to do something nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have him meet you outside real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Catch him in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've gotten way off topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Mike, thanks for coming over,
