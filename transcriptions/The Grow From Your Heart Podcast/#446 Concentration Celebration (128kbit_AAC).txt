[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this watermelon gelato
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're dabbing on some watermelon
gelato ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says 64.6% THC,
76.7% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the watermelon gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a dab of it, this watermelon
candy flavor coats your mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then as you breathe through your mouth
a little bit, as the flavor dries out,
[SPEAKER_00]: it turns into a sour apple sort of a
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first hit it, I was like,
huh, I didn't really get super high from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then about three seconds later,
it was like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about six seconds later, it was like,
oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 15 seconds later, it was like,
oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just keeps happening for probably two
or three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get a little higher and higher
and higher from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really loving the flavor, the aroma,
and the effects of the watermelon gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: RastaChef and White Mike approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the dude grows
concentration celebration in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I and a bunch of other kind folks
got to go hang out at this dude grows
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration celebration hosted by the
dude grows crew, thrown by my good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty Real.

[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this cool ass event in
which we got to attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to talk about it a little bit
because I have a podcast where I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk and run my face all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to events all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to go to events all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get spoiled like I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are more focused on other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are more on the activism side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call you White Mike because you're like
my legal guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one out here doing the grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one in the trenches doing the
fucking legal work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without your work, my work would not
happen, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a big part of what I'm able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that and I know that that's a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been there for a long time also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give you an opportunity to
talk about the Dude Grows concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: celebration that happened at Cultivated
Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm glad you came.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I just want to say thank you to the
whole DGC crew for throwing an awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a rad party.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last couple of consumption friendly
events that I've been to, it was an event
[SPEAKER_01]: that was friendly and the consumption part
was out in the back corner of the parking
[SPEAKER_01]: lot in a bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was not at all the 710 Cup,
which I really, really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for not shoving us all into
little buses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to that location for letting us
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful location.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never been there before and I loved
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The staff is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the people that help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get there to load in, they're
like, do you guys need help with anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, we've got everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a table and a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, pick a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let me set up and anything I
asked for, they brought to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed chairs for, I had granny with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I need a couple of nice chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pointed like, which of these
would you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave me a selection of really
nice chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had great chairs for granny and grumpy
grandpa there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was a great venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: The space was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the feel of the event was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a beer truck right in the
front as you walked in, which I really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty epic for a consumption
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw that, I was like, man,
they fucking thought of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really did try to think of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: From start to finish, it was a smooth
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no stubbed toes, no bonked
elbows, no hurt feelings that I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like everything ran really
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, in my Instagram post thanking
Scotty for the event, I said the party
[SPEAKER_00]: went off without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pretty smooth event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, on the quiet consumption event,
there's a lot of snags just because of how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's set up or how it wasn't planned out
as well as it should have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was none of that with the DGC
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many different aspects of
this event that there were so many
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for things to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something did kind of go wrong,
but nobody even noticed because there were
[SPEAKER_00]: so many good people involved in it that it
got overlooked and it got skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody even said, hey, what happened to
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an event planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a speaker plan to do a
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was unable to make it because he had a
family emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what happened, and I
completely think that that was more
[SPEAKER_00]: important than this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take care of your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we covered for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody even realized, hey, this guy didn't
do the talk he said he was going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had so much fun and made it
such a good event that we all everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, oh, wait, that may have broken
up the party anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only snag I hit was parking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of a key component to a
successful event is a lot of people attend
[SPEAKER_01]: and some people get there a half hour late
like I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to truck it in for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part of my story for the event was
going to be the traffic getting up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live one hundred and twenty-ish miles
from the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it was traffic was bad that
day kind of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I didn't count that for the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just saying part of my story
involves traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got I got a fucking stress headache just
from the traffic from getting up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, by the time I got there,
I was ready to load in and get dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made it super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super cool in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I was late because I got caught
in rain traffic and was a heavy downpour
[SPEAKER_01]: right over top of the event while I was
trying to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the Rhino district.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always expect shitty parking
situations in the Rhino district.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what I was getting into when I got
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like it wasn't even really it's like
when I pulled up and I saw that I
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately had to park a couple of blocks
away, I thought, man, like it already
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like a good event pulling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see kind of just through one of
the doors as I was driving past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was happy as soon as I walked in,
I saw a bunch of people that we knew and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody was having a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty different booths, each with
delicious hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friendly people and some decent swag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Deb and Granny hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was always a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love running into Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so much fun together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh yeah, you always have fun with
Granny no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: She brings a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a party in her own.
[SPEAKER_00]: She brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had my own booth set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the brand new iReGenetics booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I debuted that at the Dude Grows event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also set another table next to it
for Granny and Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good thing that I did because
when she showed up, she had boxes of raw
[SPEAKER_00]: papers to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had Deb and Granny hat pins,
Deb and Granny stickers, Deb and Granny
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could wear it, smoke it,
use it to consume, wave it around as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny probably had one with her to give
to you and also give you a hug at the
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a very generous lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She brings a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had pop sockets for phones,
but I think I have a brand new pop socket
[SPEAKER_00]: for my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she came with all kinds of good
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hanging out with Scotty is always a good
time, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't talk about Granny without talking
about Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting Granny and Scotty in the same area
together, taking dabs with them is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more like a big family get together
than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of the way that I
think Scotty wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also aimed at being an educational
event and also a concentrate competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that a little bit in the
later part of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wanted it to be just a more
friendly family, not like family,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like the Canna family, sort of a
tighter event, sort of like a family
[SPEAKER_00]: reunion instead of a big old blown out
weed expo because those get exhausting and
[SPEAKER_00]: tiresome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everybody at this event knew
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the people that came up,
I've already met them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't, I was Facebook or
Instagram or Cannabuzz friends with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew almost everybody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the drive was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting there, getting set up was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like almost as soon as I got set up,
and got comfortable, everybody started
[SPEAKER_00]: coming over and giving me dabs and asking
me questions about seeds and buying shirts
[SPEAKER_00]: and saying, what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we started medicating and dabbing
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when it got super fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even have a chair yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been there for 30 seconds and I had a
rig with a nail ready to go and a dab with
[SPEAKER_01]: my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was that kind of, it was that
type of event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She set up her table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then granny went and I was at,
I was at a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have Miss Amy with me helping me out,
but I don't, Amy can do it, but most
[SPEAKER_00]: people, they want to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they come to the booth, they're
asking questions about the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to Disneyland, you want to see
Mickey Mouse, you go to I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Amy, no disrespect to
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not downplaying her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pretty much nailed to that booth
for the rest of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But granny went over to the judging table
where the concentrates were and where they
[SPEAKER_00]: were being judged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Scotty came over and gave me a
clipboard and he's like, you got to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: judge, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I told Amy, I was like,
I got to do my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, go ahead and do your
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gives me the go-ahead look and she can
hold it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes care of the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I finally got to go over to the judging
area for a few with granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a fun experience going over
to that judging table with granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I didn't try to judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there weren't, I think there
were less than 20 complete entries and
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway through that list, I would have
been roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I nailed, I've got a list of
winners here that I'll read.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people that were
roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having a conversation with Keith
from Canon lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Canon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of his light company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes Cannons or one of the LED lights
that he makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name of your light
company right now, brother, but big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Keith and we both said
something and looked at each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think whatever one of us said,
he was basically like, do you like ice in
[SPEAKER_00]: your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bacon's not my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at each other like,
where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, everybody is so high here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, this is so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conversations didn't, but we were
talking on two different frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the same girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came up through the, uh, at the start
of the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was like, Hey, do you know Davin
granny?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you sit next to her and I was like,
yeah, I know granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, can you introduce me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we could take eight steps,
she got distracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had that exact same conversation
three times before I actually focused long
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to get a picture with granny at the
judging area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had a little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you paid a certain amount of money
or if you were a VIP guest, you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: judge's pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that judge's pass, uh,
you could go, you could go look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates without that, but you weren't
really, you could take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was going to slap you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you weren't a judge, there was enough
to share, but we wanted to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the judges all got the dabs first so that
we got to sample it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judging was over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I went through like maybe half the
line over the course of the event,
[SPEAKER_01]: just they were getting rid of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to dab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need stuff left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but up there for the pro, there was a
pro category and a home grower category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I nailed the winners in the, um,
I think I did them in the backwards order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, this number should win first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number should win second place and
this number should win third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I got them the exact backwards
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them, I opened this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, so I should describe the dabbing
area more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the dabbing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got like a, uh, cultivated
synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like a bar area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bar with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the kitchen bar,
like the Island in the bar where everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: gathers around in the bar when you're
partying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where everybody hangs out on,
but not the drinking bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an Island, I guess is what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an Island in the middle off to
the one side there and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates were on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had bar stools around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to sit on a bar stool,
most of us were just standing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd bring your rig over there and your
torch, however you choose to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could dab it however you were most
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you could get a proper judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite is this dab rig, this torch,
this carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what to expect from a dab with this
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were concentrates of different
qualities and textures and appearances and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistencies with a number on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mainly waited until I could see that
numbers one, two, and three were available
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I knew I could burn through one,
two, and three pretty quick and get one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, and three down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I waited until I saw four,
five, and six so I could get some judging
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out and not have to search for all
the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple I didn't dab,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I skipped a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, nope, I already know that
I don't need to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people say that looks can be
deceiving when it comes to a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no deception.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I didn't need to dab that to know
that the others in the lineup were already
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that appearance is part of the
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're shopping at a dispensary,
when you're looking for a car,
[SPEAKER_00]: looks make a big decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dabbed quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went hung out with Miss Amy,
made sure the booth was cool, came back,
[SPEAKER_00]: did some more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the pro category, I'm pretty sure I
knew which three were going to win top
[SPEAKER_00]: three, but I got number one and number
three flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was correct for number two, which I knew
wouldn't win number one, but I wish it
[SPEAKER_00]: would have because we'll talk about why in
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the home grower category, I think I
nailed that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, but I'm not sure who won second
place because I can't find the list
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me look at my phone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was clapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was making notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was way in the back because I had the
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: My booth was as far away from the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microphone as I could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was totally far away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the dude grows pro
division winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start from the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third place was Kemi Jones from dab logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I predicted this one would be in the top
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about this a moment ago and
I cut myself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taking the dabs and I opened this
one jar and as soon as I opened it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, Oh, it felt, it smelled like home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt so familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I know this one and I took a
dab out of it and as soon as the dabber
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the concentrate, I was like,
Oh, I know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just cracked open the aroma and
the aroma climbed up in my nose and my
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth watered a little bit and I was like,
Oh, I don't even need to dab this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I took the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two was Clementine from our friends
at apothecary farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won second place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that should have been
number one, but I think consistency and
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance are a lot of what made the
number one winner number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one was Mimosa from Nomad Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted that again, the Clementine is
sweet oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their booth was really, they were right
next to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their booth was packed and it was really
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main difference between the
Clementine and that Mimosa, they both had
[SPEAKER_00]: that orange candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Clementine is a batter and it looks
messy in the container, especially after
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple people have dabbed out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Mimosa was beautiful diamonds and
sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a nice mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diamonds were just the right size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel if apothecary would have entered
something a little chunkier, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: have had a better chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they would have entered Clementine
Ambrosia, it probably could have taken it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they entered a batter though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like batters, it took second despite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a jar of that batter sitting here
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it felt like it was home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diamonds and sauce, you take 15 dabs
out of a jar of diamonds and sauce,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've still got diamonds and sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the little burnt parts left over
when you're making pancakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a baby food jar that you let
your baby eat out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no offense to that batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what happens to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to recap, third place,
Kimmy Jones, second place.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Kimmy Jones from Jablogic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, Clementine from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: First place, Mimosa from Nomad Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody that won in
the, what is it, pro division.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the booths that were set up,
all of those were, everything I tried from
[SPEAKER_00]: a booth was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different booths had rosin that I
really liked and I don't like rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites that I was voting for
would probably have been a rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got to pick my top five favorite,
I think one of them was a rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gassy and kind of chemi flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the home grower area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the list because I can't find
it posted on any social media anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that number three, I don't know
the person 's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of it off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met the kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those young dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what I grew, what I entered.
[SPEAKER_00]: He entered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice little portion of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pointing over there like Mike can see
where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some golden goat shatter
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That golden goat was very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a big fat, I knew what that was
when I unfolded the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, that's a golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a big fat dab of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted so golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a really perfect job on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shatter, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would smoke it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put some of it in front of me,
I would smoke that shatter, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a lot of shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So third place was shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember, don't know, don't recall
who that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will post a comment on the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will tell us who second place
was, and then I'll give you an update on
[SPEAKER_00]: the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: First place was dialed in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have been watching the Dude
Grows Show podcast, dialed in terpenes was
[SPEAKER_00]: recently on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was walking around the event with much
confidence, and there was a reason why,
[SPEAKER_00]: because his product crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a Dude Grows Concentration Cup
belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize again for not having the top
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the one real piece of
constructive criticism we could put out
[SPEAKER_01]: there for the event is afterwards,
do a better job posting the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stream it live also would have been
another thing, but dude, there were so
[SPEAKER_00]: many dabs taken and so much cannabis
consumed that we're lucky we remember to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the award ceremony because people were
stoned, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a stony event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for the Dude Grows Instagram
right now so that we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they haven't posted any updates yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my advice to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we ask for is some winners posted to
social media and it will be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they'll say it on their podcast
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey you guys, make sure you support my
friends, the Dude Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a lot of people like you advertise
another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to The Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to my buddy,
The Guru, holding it down, keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: show alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also all the warehouse crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get enough love and attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warehouse Kyle, everybody out there
working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay Maestro, JR Token.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I missed you, I'm sorry I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the event was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we covered most of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going live from the event was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty Real kept creeping up on me and he
would ask me a silly question and I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: start to answer and go, be careful,
we're on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, oh shit, I was about to
say something I really don't want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: on Instagram Live because you just asked
me a fucking awkward question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a lot of time on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny's Instagram Live goes so fast that
her comments are just, you can't even read
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not jealous at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the part now is to first off,
let's invite everybody to next year's
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow DGC on social media and look for
their 420 and 710 parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we should give a shout out to all of
our friends that supported us and invited
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big, I think I've got a list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I do it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a giant shout out to Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty, without you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without you, that event would not have
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was your idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentioned it on the podcast one time,
and before he was done with the sentence
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show, I was texting him.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this doesn't happen, you failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'll pay for a booth right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got that shit to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty does not work alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a nice team behind him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team Scotty Real, Team DGC, Team Dude
Gros, Team Recharge, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a nice crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who all of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Google document.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a Google doc in which a
lot of people were participating and
[SPEAKER_00]: adding information to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to everybody on that Google
doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe a shout out to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Guru and The Dude, the entire DGC
crew and all the people that work behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about the folks behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to my friends at
Spectrum King.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also owe my friends at BNails a shout
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Ollie at BNails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect for all the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out to our friends at
Mammoth P. What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time partying with our
friends at Mammoth P. Good folks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Aquaponics Steve from Potent Ponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We owe Steve a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hung out at the booth a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to Dab and
Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without Granny, that event would not have
been as much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny is a fucking party on her own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I talk about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this lady is 63 years old and
she will out smoke and out dab you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are, but she will out
smoke and out dab you and she will laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got the heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the fucking funniest, sweetest lady
that there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has such a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's nothing but love and energy and good
vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having Granny there was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun dabbing with Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin wasn't so grumpy, so it was a lot of
fun hanging out with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got to meet Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool guy, ain't he?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not super grumpy like he's made out
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just his nickname, Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about guitars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about Granny a little bit when
she wasn't looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to hang out more often at
more events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know sometimes he keeps to himself,
but I'm going to get that old man talking
[SPEAKER_00]: to me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I want to give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally made it to an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times the stars aligned and I was
able to get out for several hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy when there's a two hour
drive on the either end of a three hour
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I was there from fucking 3.30 to
11.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you left about the same time as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny enough, Mike and I bumped into each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left and then reunited in the men's
room at a gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds really awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pissing and he walked up from behind
me and goes, hey hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he pissed at a separate stall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nothing weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good 30 miles outside of Denver
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun having you at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun when Stabby realized that you
were white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, I heard white Mike was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, you mean this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like.
[SPEAKER_01]: People's faces were great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on social media, there's a great
picture of you, me and Scotty going around
[SPEAKER_01]: in some of the comments underneath that
have had me rolling all week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Scotty is not standing on a
bench or a booster seat of any sort in
[SPEAKER_00]: that photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how tall Scotty really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's looking at me like, why the fuck
you lying to everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they know I'm lying to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody even pointed out just the angle
it's taken makes you look like the
[SPEAKER_01]: shortest person there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're pretty upfront about the fact
that you're like 6'3", 6'5".
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I'm 6'5".
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's at least 6'4".
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Scotty's got to be at least like
a good.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4'11".
[SPEAKER_00]: 4'11", 5'3", or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just fucking with you,
Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty's a normal sized dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5'3 of magic though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty's a normal sized dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he's standing next to us,
it makes him shrink down to a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: person size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big shout out to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else gets shout outs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to run through these
without sounding like some kind of award
[SPEAKER_00]: show or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, I got to give a giant shout out
to Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without Amy, the iRegion wouldn't flow as
smoothly as it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come and we do some business there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some shirts available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some iRe gifts available there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people want to talk to me like we
talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes four and five, maybe six or
22 people want to talk to me at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Amy is able to say, that guy right
there wanted a shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she'll grab the shirt and she'll hear
what size and what color shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she'll have it out before I could say,
what size and color did you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll say a black extra large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she'll be like, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she'll tap me on the shoulder with the
shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys had a beautiful little system
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, without her, it wouldn't
happen that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be me stoned, stumbling through.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you want again, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have fucked up a lot of things
without her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She alphabetized all of the products that
we carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She keeps a lot of things in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't happen without her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Stabby
McStabwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude traveled a long, long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He drove several minutes of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good to meet you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a good time to hang out with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's the second or maybe third
time, second time I get to hang out with
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you Thursday on the Embracing
Organics show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're giving a shout out to Stabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Stabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to give a shout out to Stoney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, an anonymous friend gave me a really
cool gift of a really cool pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that fucking pipe is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's green and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got some yellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got some UV working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Sherlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to Tenasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to see Tenasi and his lovely
lady at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it should have
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else do we need a shout out for?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to give a huge shout out to
Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I always shout out to J Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: J Bro brought me yet another gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That man brings the fucking greatest
gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out from one dead head to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey now, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely wanted a second at Cultivated
Synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if the event gets 30% more
popular, 30% more attendance, it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the max capacity with the part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more of the venue we can open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't open the whole place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are parts that were sealed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great little space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay for more of the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't pay for more of it, apparently,
which was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to keep it right around where we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that section of the building,
I think there were 300 approximately in
[SPEAKER_00]: that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold 350 before we have to open
more of the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was comfortable, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was space to move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was space to set your stuff down for
a minute and sit down and drink some
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of looks like it'd be a spot for
an obnoxious corporate meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a kitchen there where you could
legit make a full meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the kitchen implements were there to
use, dishwasher, fridge, the whole get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a living room space with a bunch
of comfy chairs and couches and some
[SPEAKER_01]: tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was just open space with a
nice floor for all the booth tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really nice spot for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should mention the gorgeous artwork on
the walls as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well-maintained artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I was going to say when you said
they could host boring, obnoxious meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: there, they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That place holds events like a couple of
weeks ago, maybe a week ago, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the Home Growers Cup,
which was the same type of event like we
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, the weekend after that, it was the
Colorado Department of Agriculture and MED
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a symposium of some sort where
there was absolutely no consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the suits and all the Tide
folks were hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next week, they've got us
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have consumed in a suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they do bud tender nights there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do industry night there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do sensey night there quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really, really nice space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was immediately impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a young lady there whose name I do
not know who does a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get there, she frantically runs
around and she's like, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's her question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's all you need is somebody to
go, hey, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't need anything,
for someone to go, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, shit, we're taken care of,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed to know I was taken care of,
now I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know who to talk to when shit
does go wrong and you're the person I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need when I need that window
closed or opened or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know who to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, she runs around and asks,
what do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need an extension cord or more
tables or a tablecloth or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: she's got you covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, we've just been ranting, giving
people shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so nice to go to a good and
smoothly functioning consumption event.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of the others that I've managed
to make it to over the years, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always some just like, why is this
happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is five minutes of thought two days
ago solves this headache for the 300
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an event that happened parallel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was an event that happened
right in our hometown that we drove 108
[SPEAKER_01]: miles away from to go to a better one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that event I heard was a complete shit
show.
