[SPEAKER_02]: Let's smoke and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, yo, yo, what up, massive?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know this is the vice of Jimmy
or Morgan and right now you're locked into
[SPEAKER_02]: a grow with your heart podcast right here
on my bridge in Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 868 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fun quick episode about
breeding lined up for us before we jump
[SPEAKER_01]: into the breathing conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to remind you that this podcast
is brought to you by our friends at a C
[SPEAKER_01]: infinity dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out a C infinity dot com and use
coupon code iria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out to save 10% on all of your a C
infinity equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, don't forget about the sale at irie
direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything at irie direct dot com is on
sale and all seed orders over $100 do get
[SPEAKER_01]: free shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a lot of people have been asking
about clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I owe you a clone, I will ship those
very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been negative degrees here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want me shipping your clones in
negative temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the clones will go out by the time
this episode airs and you're asking when
[SPEAKER_01]: clones will be back in stock on irie
direct as soon as it warms up a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is stressful trying to ship clones and
manage clone orders in this weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me until about the springtime when
it warms up a little bit across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will put clones back on irie direct dot
com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all of the advertising I've got
here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the breeding portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is irie genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab and send me a
good grow question and I read your
[SPEAKER_01]: question here on the podcast, I will send
you a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: at irie direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's question came from my new friend
Buckeye 420 Buckeye 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you make sure you check your inbox
and check your spam because you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: At irie direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fun question and it goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, bro, bro, it says, I've listened
to all of your podcasts and some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: more than multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what more than multiple
means, but bro, thank you for listening so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the loyal listenership.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the multiple clicks and the
views on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I love all of the knowledge you
put down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, bro, thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a question in all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I would like to conduct a small
breeding project of approximately 10
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard you say at times that you can
use beer cups when breeding or
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about your process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it going, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is a great, this is a great
project, a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fun project for me to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this listener has heard me talk about
breeding projects that happen in beer
[SPEAKER_01]: cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you people right now are going to
what you can breed in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we don't need giant plants for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this listener said they wanted to do
about 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was going to do beer cups,
part of why I do beer cups is to do a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more than 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can fit, I've got a tray that holds 24
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put 24 in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what your limit is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what your plant count is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do 24 anymore because a plant
counts and plant limits where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to do 24 on the tray in the
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put multiple trays of 24 to be
honest with you, but I can fit 24 in a
[SPEAKER_01]: tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can fit under one light very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very easy breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this episode, I'm going to focus on
about 24 plants in a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what we're going to talk
about just because that's how I would do
[SPEAKER_01]: this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't encourage you to break the rules,
violate the laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not anybody that could tell you what
to do legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So enter at your own risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow the rules at your own risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a fucking adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't encourage you to do illegal shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing illegal shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody here is doing anything illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's follow the rules and do this
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about a small breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: This listener said 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already touched that we're going to
do more than 10 in my idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to jump right into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who, when, where, why, how, how much are
we going to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that you want to do a small
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a way to do a breeding project
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I choose a breeding project in beer
cups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just start right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use a much larger pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do bigger pots and have much
more success with larger plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a home grower, for a home breeder
who just wants to make a few seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves to play with, if you just need
30, 50, maybe a hundred seeds of
[SPEAKER_01]: something, this is a beautiful project you
can put.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would do, I've got a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a stir light tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made to put clothing or goods to
store it under your bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of long and wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made to slide under the bed so you
can put your stuff in there and stash all
[SPEAKER_01]: your goodies under the bed and get more
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said under the bed enough times it feels
awkward now, but it's an under the bed
[SPEAKER_01]: storage bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's approximately, I'm holding up my
hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's about two feet by 16 inches
and it holds 24 beer cups in it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fit them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's rows of four by six is how it
fits and they just fit in there perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you rattle it around, they won't
fall over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like to fill the tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps it full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing tips over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would do, I would cut 24 clones
and I would put 24 clones in these little
[SPEAKER_01]: beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of those cuts would be the same male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do clones of the same exact male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got 22 females and two cuts of the
same dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all you've got to do is veg those
until they're four or five, maybe six or
[SPEAKER_01]: seven inches tall at the most,
and then flip them all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take a lot of room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take a lot of soil,
water, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't take a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put 24 little plants in beer
cups and veg them up, maybe two GI Joes
[SPEAKER_01]: tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's seven inches, two GI Joes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's boy math, but every boy
knows what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two GI Joes tall, flip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants will grow up to be about 50,
15 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to put a stick in there to
keep them supported.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have enough wind and light
going on, depending on your environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: they may need some support.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what will happen is those plants will
go into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: On about 14 days, the girls will start
telling you, we're girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: In about 14 days, the two boy plants will
verify we are boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 21 days in, 22, 25 days in,
pollen will start coming out of your boy
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could simply leave them all right
there in the room and it will pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could take one of those boy plants
and pick them up and dust them around all
[SPEAKER_01]: those girl plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every pistol in that room is gonna get
pollinated by those two male plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: will produce enough pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds wild, but it's really
quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A short veg, we need to veg them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, seven, maybe 10 inches tall
at the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna get floppy in a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep them shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be easier to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep them short.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a short veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna flip them when they're seven
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're already ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people aren't even done vegging yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are gonna transplant two times
before they flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already flipping these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're already into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you're pollinating,
I haven't even transplanted to my next
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you're done, now I'm
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So short veg, flip them, pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would wait a week or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the pollination is
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've still got one male plant that
you haven't cut down in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: take that dude and do another pollination
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, you could chop down your
male plants, get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe leave the cups in there just to keep
that tray from tipping over, or the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: from tipping over in the tray if you've
packed 24 in there like I suggested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could do as many as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that 24 is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you've done your second
pollination, what I recommend at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point, and this is where a lot of people
are gonna think I'm freaking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would turn those lights back to 18 hours
on and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do that until these plants are
finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are not gonna look pretty,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to look like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 six will make the plants look ugly,
but you're not growing for flowers at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every pistol, every calyx is filled with a
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no bud to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna have anything useful to
smoke out of this, and it's all going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be completely seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we cut down these plants,
which we'll talk about in a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be fully completely seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're running 18 six and these
plants start to look completely shitty,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna go into revege.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna see some world leaves,
but that's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going for healthy, happy,
fat seeds, and that's what we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get by going to 18 hours on and six hours
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six to eight weeks later, it will be
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, what we're gonna do,
it'll be very, very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be nothing but seeds in
these plants, so don't even try to
[SPEAKER_01]: conserve any of it for smokable material.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I recommend is a separate container
for each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got multiple plants of the same
strain, you can use that container for
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple plants of the same strain,
but we don't want to mix up the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would get some sort of a bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turkey pans are a great suggestion right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, I did an episode about
affordable grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turkey pans, little turkey pans from the
grocery store, those would work
[SPEAKER_01]: beautifully right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get a turkey pan, get a plant,
cut the plant down, hang the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: let it dry until it's completely dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it is completely dry, take that plant
and your turkey pan and pull the stick out
[SPEAKER_01]: of all the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hold the buds with your finger and
just pull the stick right out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real short stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the buds will fall off into your
turkey pan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just use rubber gloves and just grind
all that flour material up, real good,
[SPEAKER_01]: real well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all your seeds are gonna fall out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your weeds are gonna fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then simply tip that turkey pan to the
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your seeds are gonna roll down to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all gonna be seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to make edibles or
something out of that leftover flour
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, it's so beat up that if
you make edibles or concentrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes out green because the removal
process, it beats it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives it so many broken edges and so
much surface area and so much chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: is freed that your edibles and your
concentrates come out green and funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to put it on 18-6, let the seeds
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take six to eight weeks for them to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then chop them, hang them upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them get dry as fuck is my unit of
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then pull the sticks off, the buds off the
sticks, grind it up, separate the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got your first new cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, depending on the size of the plant,
the amount of pistols on the plant when
[SPEAKER_01]: you did this, how far into maturity that
female plant was when it received pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are a lot of factors here,
but you should receive somewhere between
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 and 100 to 150 seeds per plant if you
do this properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a tray of 22 plants,
you do the math, 25 to 100 seeds per
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got quite a few new seeds to play
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a very experienced grower and breeder
and person who has had their heart broken,
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you carefully label all of
these plants and do your best to keep all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running multiple strains,
do your best to keep them separated and
[SPEAKER_01]: very carefully labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your new passion project.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just spent weeks doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you keep everything carefully
labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get the seeds out of the buds,
put them in a jar or a baggie and label
[SPEAKER_01]: that jar or that baggie, whatever cross to
whatever cross made on this date and put
[SPEAKER_01]: those somewhere that you know they're
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, dry, dark environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about feeding
these seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got little beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overwater them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could cause you major problems if you
overfeed these cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically feed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of a flour mix, but I stick
with the base nutrient for the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding bottled nutrients,
I stick with the grow base because I want
[SPEAKER_01]: that extra bit of nitrogen in there to
give me those healthy fat seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also increase the cow mag a little
bit when I'm making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's something I do not say a lot on
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a golden nugget of information
that I kind of keep secret, something I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't share a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to gate keep anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to do as well as I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of amino acids will go very
well for your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids are the building blocks of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not feed the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids give them a strong,
healthy start.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I start seeing seed
development, I start feeding the amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I skipped, I didn't even write
this down when I said seed development,
[SPEAKER_01]: brain went ding ding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about how do we tell when these seeds
are ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying about six to eight weeks and
you will have seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are really, we have a hard
enough time judging when to cut down our
[SPEAKER_01]: non-seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do I cut it?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do I cut it is one of the biggest
questions I ever get.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to that is use a magnifying
glass and check out your trichomes most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we've got a seeded plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do I cut it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see seeds popping out of
some of your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of your buds, the top calyxes are
going to explode and a little seed is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pop out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start seeing those seeds,
it is almost time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I recommend is just grab a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see them popping out of the buds,
out of the calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a seed from somewhere, anywhere on
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see one, grab that bad bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pick it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might do a little bit of damage to the
plant, but there's so many seeds in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull out a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake off all the husk, the whole,
all the material, all the green material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that off of your seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in the palm of your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it look like it's the right color?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it getting tiger stripes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it dark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it pale?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's green, if it's pale, if it's
yellowish, it's probably not ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's starting to get a dark color,
a little bit of a shine to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to get some tiger stripes,
you're probably looking at a seed that is
[SPEAKER_01]: ready or very close to ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ultimate test to find out if that seed
is ready, my fingers are trained for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got drummer fingers and seed breeder
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drummer fingers are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you played congas and hand drums for
years, I realized recently my fingers are
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got hard fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But grab those seeds and give them a
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I squeeze it between my thumb and my
forefinger, if the seed hurts your finger
[SPEAKER_01]: when you squeeze it, that seed's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the seed explodes, that shit's not
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I squeeze them pretty hard before they
break, and that's how I know that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab two or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab them from multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll know when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be really fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a little bit longer if you don't
think that they're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pros and cons of waiting too long and
going too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go too early and cut down,
your seeds will not be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them fucking finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wait too long, those seeds could
have a hard time germinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may become a little bit too strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outer shell becomes a little bit
tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to soak them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to scarify them to get them to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time you guys take your shit
down way too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start squeezing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if they're hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're hard enough, then they're
probably ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see little sprouts coming out of
your soil, your seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens a lot of times is a seed will
fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of your plants that are growing and
this is what's supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking nature doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed will grow strong enough to grow
out of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fall right out of the plant into
your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll water it not knowing that it's
there and it will germinate and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: grow right up out of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got your original plant and you
got a sprout growing out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a sign that your seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the seeds are falling out like that,
they are absolutely ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get between I wrote down
30 to 100 seeds a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said 25 to 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: That depends on the size of the plant,
the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll learn after you do a couple of
breeding projects that different plants
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be pollinated at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll also learn that different male
plants put out pollen at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a time frame where you can kind of
standardize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put the boys and the girls in the
same room at the same time, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature, it works that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use these two plants as an
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a strawberry fields plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the mom that makes Raphael
strawberry burst.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else does that bad bitch make?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strawberry fields plant from
Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a lot of good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got a platinum tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the mom to the Michelangelo,
the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one makes a lot of good shit also.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are both amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they are very different in a lot
of different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry fields plant grows real
tall and real lanky and gives me real long
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The platinum tangy kind of shorter,
squatter, smaller, tighter buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: More maple leaf kind of a leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry's got those big tropical
long leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry plant wants pollen much
later than the platinum tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, I would pollinate the strawberry
plant around day 35 and the tangy plant
[SPEAKER_01]: around like day 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like 10 days apart on when they
want pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll learn these sort of things as
you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll learn that I should put this plant
in here on this week and then wait a week
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put this plant in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn to get the male plants a week
ahead or a week behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes experimenting and it's like
learning a partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like taking people out on dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to see what they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they like your jokes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they hate your jokes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they into the cow mag or do they hate
cow mag?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they want bloom boosters at week six or
would they rather you just give them just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight go with whatever your basic feed
is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to make shit up as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to develop a relationship
with these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the art of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of science behind breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could write you SOPs that will work,
but you're going to have to get in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and learn the plants to figure out how to
optimize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make as many seeds as possible by timing
and by learning the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: When does this male dump the most pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some boys start dumping it like 23,
24.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some boys day 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, some girls want
pollen at day 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some want pollen day 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just got to learn how to time all
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When to get the females at the ripest when
they're peaking for pollen and get the boy
[SPEAKER_01]: when he's done dumping the most pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to time that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an art and a skill that you will
develop over a few crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point you have made a bunch of
brand new seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a bunch of brand new crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully stuff that's never been made
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you started off with at least
10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you did 24 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you did 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have got a bunch of brand new
seeds that you grew from little tiny pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only took a little bit of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do this in a three by three
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do this in a little tiny closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could build a little makeshift room
for this, because they're not going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: very tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a tent that lays on its side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really short tent that lays on its
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a propagation tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could breed seeds in that propagation
tent if you followed this advice that I
[SPEAKER_01]: just gave you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, hopefully you've got a
bunch of brand new seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the excitement is growing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to see what you just created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got 10 new crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got 20 new crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got somewhere between what's 20
times 20 and 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: That many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that number here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got that many new crosses to grow
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did 100, you've got 2,500 new seeds
to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend when you use a new male plant,
when you use any male plant, to pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple females and then run the progeny
from those projects, because what we get
[SPEAKER_01]: to see now is that male and female are
going to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all instances, they're going to cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get an outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just going to make stuff up for
this part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that the male is chocolate,
because that's easy to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a male that produces chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the trait we're going with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got strawberry and lemon
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to go hypothetical
because I can remember those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get high and forget shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say that we pollinate chocolate
to strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably going to get
chocolate-strawberry turps, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get combos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see stuff that looks like
chocolate, stuff that looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry, and chocolate-strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to find traits in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do we know what consistently the
father, the chocolate, is passing to that
[SPEAKER_01]: cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what he did to lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we get chocolate-lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there lemon turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there chocolate turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there chocolate-lemon turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do both of these crosses completely
have dominant chocolate turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was the other flavor allowed to shine?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not just going with just flavor,
but other traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe chocolate put a funky leaf shape
into everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do all of my crosses show this weird leaf
shape, or does it only come through on
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see how this male plays with
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how it mixes amongst other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the fun part of discovering
what your male plant does in your
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossing it to one plant, that could be an
anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say it makes the frostiest
plants ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know that came from the male?
[SPEAKER_01]: That could have came from the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say it makes the most amazing
chocolate turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it with five, six, 12 different
crosses and see what the commonalities and
[SPEAKER_01]: the differences is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Differences is?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to make some weird
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of weird stumbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to edit that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see commonalities and
differences, and that's the fun part of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get to take those traits further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really crazy is when you don't
see certain traits in your breeding until
[SPEAKER_01]: F3, and then something that was in the
original parent pops up and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's that trait again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, now I'm rambling and getting
excited about breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you are as excited about breeding
as I am, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I love breeding and growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Buckeye420, my dude,
thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was a full podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate it.

do have a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds at Hyreedirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do encourage you and welcome you and
invite you to add my seeds to your
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of breeders out there have weird
rules and stick up their ass about
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bought them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made them with love so that people out
there can be successful with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make yourself successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't I want you successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give you a good foundation,
good building blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build that fucking castle, my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, where are we?
