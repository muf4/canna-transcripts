[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 72 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: caregiver, if you're a new smoker or a
veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: activist, or even someone who's just
curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining me, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting across the table from me is my
good buddy, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn this music down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that real loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to yell over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a dab and my lungs are doing
that fluttery thing they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the intro, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got definitely warmed up before we
started recording today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just took some monster dabs of some,
that was Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extracted by my good friends, my great
friends, my champion friends over at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some dedicated dabbers at the
Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stayed up and stayed in line outside
of a Lusion's Glass Galleries in Boulder
[SPEAKER_02]: overnight to scoop a new mothership rig,
and they got one, and it is sexy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at photos today.
Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some dedication right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: People may say that that mothership rig is
a bit excessive, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys deserve that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck anybody that hates on you for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They worked for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They earned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They invited me over for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go take some dabs over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming, Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matti, make some cheesecake, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was I in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to send a big shout out to Kat and
Coot from the Mystic Roots Band before we
[SPEAKER_02]: go too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots crew
let me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should cost me a lot of money to play
music on a podcast if you do things
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly, but they let me have access to
their full library.
[SPEAKER_02]: They emailed me everything, all the
instrumental tracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of cool of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to burp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to get that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to force it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The organic portions of this podcast are
brought to you by my great friends at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check out the Rocky Mountain
Worm Company in Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get African Nightcrawlers,
Red Wigglers, and all of your organic soil
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if they still have the
Dragonfly Earth medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time you listen to this,
but they have for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been selling them like a beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them before they run out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use all the worm castings I use by
visiting www.rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're in Colorado Springs,
they are at 411 Tijuana Street in Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you tell them that you learned
about them through the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might show you the worm factory,
if you ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worm farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take you with me next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take Mike with next time,
and he can stick his hands in the worm
[SPEAKER_02]: farm and see what goes on in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to the sponsor that helps

[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are interested in sponsoring
the show, send me an email.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you all the information that you
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to leave some comments on
Facebook, Twitter, Stitcher, iTunes,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that stuff, I'd really appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to the heart of the matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I got to say a couple more
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I forgot that I've got a whole
nother pile of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a big show this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get to the beef of the show
because we've got some shit that pissed me
[SPEAKER_02]: off when I read it, and I had to have Mike
come over and kind of interpret.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a week full of some horse shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the good part of the week on Monday,
my good buddy Clint, shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: My car has been broke down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint called me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, hey, dude, I know you're stuck
in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the 420 Speakeasy in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do some comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he picked me up and he took me up
to Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 420 Speakeasy is pretty damn cool,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cost me 10 bucks to get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They checked my ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I walked in, there's a dab bar
that you don't buy dabs, you buy credits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can trade your credits for
dabs or flowers that you consume on site,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can trade your credits for Mountain
Dew or orange juice, or they had ice
[SPEAKER_02]: creams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a credit system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we know what's going on there,
but good way around some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was welcome to pull out my own rig and
my own dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm kind of a dab snob.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really want to- Most of those
places are BYO everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I- Or rent glass, but bring your own
everything to put in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did have sweet rigs for rent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course I show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the Eric Ross 4.0 custom rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no need for any other rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought my own Earl with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sat at a booth and just dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dustin, Drew, Clint, and myself sat there
and dabbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint didn't take any dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of a puss, but he smoked weed
with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had something to do that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he did a set of comedy that was,
it was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint had a life-changing event that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the comedy really let that event
come out on stage and that was quite
[SPEAKER_02]: entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Ben Verbeck.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hosts, it's called Comedy Anarchy at
the 420 Speakeasy on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it starts at eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys want some comedy,
you want to go smoke some weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to take some dabs, check that
place out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're livin' up your Monday people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go see some funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go support my friend Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go support comedy and Ben Verbeck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun because you could dab and see
comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't pay me or anything to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a good time, wanted to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool having a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't at home and I was with a few of
my bros and I was meeting new bros,
[SPEAKER_02]: just taking dabs and kicking back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was open mic comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was moments of free
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to the 420 Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, somebody sent me an email asking me,
they want to add another light to their
[SPEAKER_02]: room and they wanted to know what the best
type of light would be in their situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the light I would recommend
would be a Gavita for almost any situation
[SPEAKER_02]: other than like a tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a room and you're trying to
put new lights in there, go Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The double-ended bulb technology will push
your plants to another level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that answers your question
there, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a Gavita.
[SPEAKER_02]: I emailed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you respond to the email also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to brag about something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The podcast on Stitcher, we have reached a
peak rank of 748th out of 40,000 shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of listens, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spectacular, especially through Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Stitcher alone on Mondays,
you guys are listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You download the show, 5,000 downloads on
Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it up, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody that downloads
it on Stitcher, iTunes, and the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We moved up in the ranks on Stitcher quite
dramatically in the health and lifestyle
[SPEAKER_02]: category.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were ranked number 59 this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that is because of me being a
guest speaker on the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: radio show about a week ago with LS Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: He definitely plugged my show heavily.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to send a huge, huge shout out
to LS Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't already listen to it,
make sure you go listen to medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana radio with LS Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not found it on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to help him get his show
on iTunes because that's what he really
[SPEAKER_02]: needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step him up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just teach him about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to LS Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,000 people just on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thanks for the love, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means another 5,000 on iTunes and
probably another half of that on my
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting- Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded straight off the website,
so I've just got it on my phone to play
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever when I'm rolling, but Stitcher it
up, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher shows me on Mondays that 5,000
people listen.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All 5,000 of you that listen on Monday,
everybody that listens through the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're driving to work and I hope I'm
making your garden time, your work time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're stuck in a cubicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're stuck in that cubicle,
I know who I'm talking to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I'm making your day better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to the news,
I promise, but I want to talk about one
[SPEAKER_02]: more thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a supporter of a company called
Grassroots California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make these stylish hats that I wear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make some pretty cool clothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company Grassroots has a store in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get you a grassroots hat,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this beanie off my head, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been wearing a beanie since I met him
through the summer, through the winter for
[SPEAKER_02]: like seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Ashley, hell of a beanie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been promised she's going to visit
here sometime in the next year and make me
[SPEAKER_03]: a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're never going to get you a hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be a beanie forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to change you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guys at Grassroots, shout out to
Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the owner and founder of Grassroots
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a hat company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They support the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: They host the 710 Cup, which is a dab
festival where it's a dab competition,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they opened a business called The
Break Room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What The Break Room was, was a smoking
lounge that you could bring your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't sell anything there,
but you had to bring your own hat,
[SPEAKER_02]: your own flowers, and you could hang out
in this building and socialize and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had games and activities to do to
keep you entertained and snacks,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on 420, the Denver police raided The
Break Room.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't the only ones raided,
but they were among those raided on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a huge sweep on 420,
which come on cops, it's a dick move,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Rape Solve rate is still at like 40%
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we're raiding speakeasies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they go in and they raid The Break Room
and they shut the place down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in turn, they shut down The Grassroots
Store.
[SPEAKER_02]: But The Grassroots Store is a separate
business and the store is divided.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a separate staff, a separate cash
register, a separate entrance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since it's Ryan's store and
everything, they shut down both buildings
[SPEAKER_02]: and now they are forcing... The city of
Denver is kind of strong arm forcing the
[SPEAKER_02]: owner of the building to evict Ryan from
their prime location on Larimer,
[SPEAKER_02]: where they've never had a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got such good sales there because
of their location.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've never done anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now this dude that has put his life
into this company to make these sweet hats
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wear and that you guys probably
wear if you're part of the movement and
[SPEAKER_02]: you listen to this show, I'm sure one out
of 10 of you guys has got a grassroots hat
[SPEAKER_02]: on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be forced to move out of
that building and find another building,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is going to be hard because
everybody already knows... It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they know who he's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want him there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to say, no, because you're
going to open another pot business and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to break the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, he's got a GoFundMe and all
kinds of crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to beg for Ryan,
but support Ryan any way that you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to your council people in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to the Denver city attorneys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know that you think it's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your opinion does matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they hear it enough, it might make
a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time we're asking you to
get involved tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't be the last.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike definitely needs you to get off the
couch and help us do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just me, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every cannabis consumer needs every other
cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We slept a little bit on some voting and
it looks like we got fucked by sleeping
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm going to read you some shit in
just a minute that you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait, that happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of fugly headed up later in
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into those news articles that
we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a quick small drink of
this here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a drink and then we'll get into
some news.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm nice and hydrated now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for this news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got so many things on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a big week in Colorado news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's from the Westward.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline is medical marijuana
crackdown bill now law.
[SPEAKER_02]: More about money than safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the article is by Michael Roberts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, governor John Hickenlooper signed
Senate bill 15-014, which has been
[SPEAKER_02]: characterized as a medical pot crackdown
bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Among other things, the legislation will
empower a board in consultation with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado department of public health and
environment to establish guidelines for
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians making medical marijuana
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: The provision is backed by those like
Aguilar who doubt that most medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana card holders receiving
recommendations for treatment of severe
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, a group that makes up approximately
93% of the total actually suffer from this
[SPEAKER_02]: condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we'll, we'll take a minute to bitch
about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, there's a lot of stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, the 93% of Colorado medical
marijuana card holders list chronic and
[SPEAKER_03]: severe pain as one of their qualifying
conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you add all of the qualifying
conditions up, you get way more than a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because a lot of people list that
along with cancer, AIDS, MS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cachexia is one of the major ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crohn's there's countless other ailments
on the list of qualifying conditions that
[SPEAKER_03]: cause severe pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so pretty much everyone with a medical
marijuana card in Colorado, also includes
[SPEAKER_03]: severe pain when they're signing up with
their doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the legislature has done and the
theory, I guess for several years has been
[SPEAKER_03]: that that 97% number is the fakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when, I don't know, when people,
I suppose, park in outside dispensaries
[SPEAKER_03]: across the street and watch people come
and go every day, like there were all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of people claiming they did this
regularly right after we legalized and
[SPEAKER_03]: right after the medical expansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't tell what's wrong with me by the
way I walk from my car to the dispensary.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see my nerve damage from 20
yards away.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even need to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I have plenty of medical
conditions we could talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pain is one of them, but it's,
I shouldn't even have to say what's wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a medical marijuana card and it's
really not that detective or that nosy
[SPEAKER_02]: person's business, what my problem is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these people have decided that that 97%
numbers probably all of the fakers in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado, which is like 97,000 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's roughly a hundred thousand
people on the registry right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're assuming roughly 97,000 people
are basically faking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this bill is a big attempt to push as
many of them as they can back into the rec
[SPEAKER_03]: market where we're paying 22% more taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're going to blow this guy's
whole paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy wrote an article and you just
fucking shot it all down for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, you just buried the lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this guy that took time onto this
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it says, but is this new rule more
about safety or money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though a 15-01-4 is now law,
the debate continues to rage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The highest profile backer of the bill was
Senator Irene Aguilar, whose website lists
[SPEAKER_02]: her as Senator Irene Aguilar MD and
stresses her own medical background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Mike was getting at is they're
trying to make it harder for you to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana card for your pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we suspect that it's to drive you to
the recreational dispensaries where taxes
[SPEAKER_02]: are higher and you've got to spend more
money and pay more taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the state makes more money because a
lot of the things that we see going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: this bill are all about the taxes and the
money and fuck the patients and the
[SPEAKER_02]: caregivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a long bill and it does several
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if you take a look at it as a
whole, all of the things it does are
[SPEAKER_03]: designed to push people off of the medical
registry and into the rec market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next paragraph in this article just is
an excerpt from this lady's website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically it brags and says,
I'm too cool for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It talks about all the places she went to
school and her qualifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it goes on to say, will the bill's
new guidelines make it more difficult for
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians to recommend medical marijuana
to those who say they are plagued by
[SPEAKER_02]: severe pain?
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, longtime Westward marijuana writer
William Breeds fears some patients who
[SPEAKER_02]: really need MMJ will be deprived of the
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here's an excerpt from another
article he wrote in March that says,
[SPEAKER_02]: studies show that as many as 100 million
Americans suffer from chronic pain and
[SPEAKER_02]: that it affects more people than diabetes,
coronary heart disease, and cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the American Academy of Pain
Medicine, 20% of all American adults
[SPEAKER_02]: experience chronic pain severe enough to
disrupt their sleep at least two times per
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of patients on the Colorado
Medical Marijuana Registry who claim
[SPEAKER_02]: severe pain is around 105,500 people,
just below 2% of the total population.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that 1.9% of the state's
residents experience chronic pain and have
[SPEAKER_02]: turned to cannabis to help is hardly
surprising or shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Breeds also notes, excuse me,
Breeds also notes that the assorted
[SPEAKER_02]: lawmakers in favor of the proposal have
made it clear that the measure is a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve some medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, I read that wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: A way to move some medical marijuana
patients into recreational pot sales,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are taxed at higher rates than
medical pot sales in order to generate
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable tax revenue for state and local
governments.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between the amount of tax
revenue generated by the recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana versus medical cannabis are
stark, as we pointed out last week in a
[SPEAKER_02]: post about rec pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we talked about how much the
taxes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they show a graph here that shows
state of Colorado medical marijuana sales
[SPEAKER_02]: tax for the month of March.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it shows, this is medical in
Adams County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's find Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did 14,000 $904 in the month of
March.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's go down to look at the same
thing, Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The additional 10% sales tax brought in
$135,215.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they just want to move you right
over to that rec market so that you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend that extra $135,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a dick move.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were working on this three years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they sort of dropped it last
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the hype was that a whole bunch of
people were going to join the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana registry to avoid the taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that didn't happen, they brought
up the severe pain number again and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, let's push more of those people out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the data collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they saw that the medical marijuana
market consumed like 65 or 70% of the $700
[SPEAKER_03]: million worth of marijuana sold in
Colorado last year, they kind of freaked.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they don't get is that rec consumers
consume occasionally, recreationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medical consumers consume daily for
medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we're consuming the majority of
the meds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this was designed for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep going back to this part,
but we'd put cannabis on the legal market
[SPEAKER_02]: here for medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the model started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that's who we have screwed over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who's getting pushed right out of
all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting attacked from every angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state's taking money out of the
registry that they're not supposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: access and spending it on stuff they're
not supposed to spend it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking to make it harder to get a
extended plant count to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendation for severe pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking to limit that with
caregivers and a half dozen different ways
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to talk about in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting tough to be a medical patient
in Colorado if you don't really keep up on
[SPEAKER_03]: your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be especially harder to
be a caregiver here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got another article on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to the one that we just
read, but it goes on a different direction
[SPEAKER_02]: toward the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it's about the same law.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just such a big lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's several different news articles on
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to read part of the
new bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have the PDF on my screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll read part of that bill in just a
minute too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the headline alone will be enough to
make you understand why we're so
[SPEAKER_02]: frustrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll read some parts from that bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says, this article is actually
written by Kristen Wyatt and I found it on
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mike sent me a link to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I called you to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline is Colorado medical pot,
new caregiver limits, MMJ in schools,
[SPEAKER_02]: okayed by government.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Colorado's governor signed into
law, a crackdown on medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fucking tongue twister.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole new, we should just make
that something right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana Mondays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start over though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado's governor signed into law,
a crackdown on medical marijuana Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of two measures designed to ferret out
people and properly using and selling
[SPEAKER_02]: untaxed marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we need an Oxford comma in
this sentence right here after the word
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would fix this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the wrong guy to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it says, the law limits
caregivers, those who grow pot on behalf
[SPEAKER_02]: of patients to 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The change means that some high volume
caregivers will face the same oversight as
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial growers, paying licensing fees
and undergrowing background checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new rule in Senate bill 14 have
support from the recreational pot
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, which has complained that the
light regulation on Colorado's caregivers
[SPEAKER_02]: has invited black market growers who don't
face residency requirements, background
[SPEAKER_02]: checks, or commercial seed to sale
tracking used to ensure pot plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: grown and sold legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those people just have to grow
cannabis either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Black market production people just do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're moving here to Colorado,
it's to hide amongst the many,
[SPEAKER_03]: like those idiots doing those warehouses
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they stood out like a sore thumb
because they weren't operating legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was clear to everyone around them
that they were about to get busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were quickly busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many things I want to rant
about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one thing that they did that was
cool is they left it at 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got more than that, you're doing
something weird anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fees and background checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would open our own dispensary if we
wanted background checks and fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're just a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just low key growing a little bit of
cannabis for somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, dispensaries make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caregivers can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of the beauty of the caregiver
system is there's a huge number of people
[SPEAKER_03]: in Colorado that can't afford to be
spending four or $500 a week on medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without caregivers, I don't know a lot
of people that could manage their pain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know several people that would be shit
out of luck if I couldn't grow their
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine for them or supply their medicine
in some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost savings when you go through a
caregiver is significant over trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: shop and even the medical dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And getting rid of the caregivers pushes
more people into the medical legal system
[SPEAKER_03]: of the shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, I hate this bill so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The article goes on to say we're really
trying to make sure that caregivers are
[SPEAKER_02]: part of our regulatory system,
said representative Jonathan Singer from
[SPEAKER_02]: Longmont, who sponsored the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caregivers have successfully resisted such
limits for years, but the law includes
[SPEAKER_02]: some concessions that won their
acceptance.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the law eliminates an
unenforced requirement that parents of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana patients under 18 grow the drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that now, back in the day,
if you were under 18 and you were a
[SPEAKER_02]: patient, your parents had to grow for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't assign a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't shop at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that kind of changes the rules there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rule had... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two not horrible parts of this
bill or you could even call them decent
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rule puts some parents who moved to
Colorado seeking cannabis treatments for
[SPEAKER_02]: their children outside the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now those folks will be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also sets up a task force to start work
on public access to the state's few
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the marijuana industry has generally
opposed public access to the labs fearing
[SPEAKER_03]: backlogs, but... That's some horse shit,
ain't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let that sentence sink in for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: The industry is fighting letting
caregivers access testing labs because it
[SPEAKER_03]: might take them an extra day to get their
test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want business?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't the labs standing up asking for
more business?
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my medicine needs to be tested just as
badly as the dispensary's does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whoever else's growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dumb rule came down, what,
after one batch of tests you got in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one or two good batches of testing
in before they shut that down so that I
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't do it anymore.
Yep.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much stuff in this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I might skip a couple of
paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, this one is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The law allows school districts to
consider allowing medical marijuana use on
[SPEAKER_02]: campus as long as the pot is administered
by a parent or designated medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana professional, not a school
nurse.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pot in school's allowance would be the
nation's first, though it's not clear how
[SPEAKER_02]: many school districts would participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nor would it allow any sort of smoked
consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's capsules, oils, tinctures,
lotions only.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, it's a huge step in the right
direction.
That's still an improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because a kid that's got ADD or
whatever else that requires a medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: that day... There are hundreds of kids
that have moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to the nurse and get their pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just saying if you take a pill,
if you take a prescription, you go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: school nurse after lunch and she gives you
your pill, why can't you just go in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and get your ganja cookie or your sweet
stone candy bear or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're skirting federal law again and
being silly, but it's a step in the right
[SPEAKER_03]: direction at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very tiny possible step in the
right direction, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small steps, baby steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on to say, Governor Hickenlooper
said the law was a compromise worked out
[SPEAKER_02]: by both political parties and the pot
industry and caregivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The news went apeshit with this particular
amendment the last couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: pot in schools.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anti-pot people had a big hit with it
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen this since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was the budtender and I was the
manager at the very first dispensary in
[SPEAKER_02]: this little town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still surprised they're going to let
the kids use their edibles or whatever in
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've literally had hundreds of kids move
to Colorado to access this as a medication
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of them have to go to school.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of the things that we need
to find a good workaround for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big step.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty good reflection of what the
community wants, Hickenlooper said.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the law doesn't require caregivers to
register their growing operations,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead it encourages them to register by
assuring them that authorities could
[SPEAKER_02]: verify their number of plants without
starting a criminal investigation instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of forcing caregivers to prove in court
that their operation is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sort of makes sense, but it also
seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's a really backwards provision
where they're saying to keep from looking
[SPEAKER_03]: guilty, stand up and prove you're innocent
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any caregiver who's operating legally
answers the cop at the door with a binder
[SPEAKER_03]: full of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the cop can add, there's no difficult
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lucky because of where we live.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cops will come and they'll say,
you grow weed here?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go, yeah, I got a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go, you got a medical card?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, okay, I've got so much other shit
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't stab anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: For people in other towns, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you've got, if you're in a nice
residential area and you stank it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it'd be a good idea just to go
register, just to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that this bill has been passed,
it would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they require it if you're doing more
than six plant minimums.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to have to read this
bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a caregiver, you need to hop
online and download the PDF of this bill
[SPEAKER_03]: and read every word.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's short.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't be intimidated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give yourself a little pen and paper,
make some bullet points of what you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: to do now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Hickenlooper signed the measure at a
Denver police station to show goodwill
[SPEAKER_02]: between law enforcement and caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The language in the law came after years
of testing negotiations between medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana groups and police.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are good reasons for all sides to
not trust each other, said Terry Robnett,
[SPEAKER_02]: head of the Cannabis Patients Alliance,
who helped negotiate the language.
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor has yet to sign the other
medical marijuana law that measures,
[SPEAKER_02]: that measure updates marijuana regulations
that were written before Colorado made pot
[SPEAKER_02]: legal for adults in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of stuff going on in this
bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were saying, you guys,
I'm going to find the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it on my, I've got the PDF here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of things that really
got Mike's attention and my attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts off and it says a bill for an
act.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline is concerning marijuana
issues that are not regulated by the
[SPEAKER_02]: department of revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're basically, they're starting off
by saying money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is shit that we're not getting money
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's money swimming by that we're not
catching.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it sounds like they're saying
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the people we can't monitor and
overtax and here are the ways we've found
[SPEAKER_03]: to rectify that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first part is marijuana revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bill requires the Colorado medical
board to adopt rules regarding guidelines
[SPEAKER_02]: for physicians who make medical marijuana
recommendations for patients suffering
[SPEAKER_02]: from severe pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to find a new way to figure out
if you really hurt or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've decided that your doctor isn't
qualified to believe you and you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: qualified to tell your doctor what hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're going to come up with a
little sheet or some paperwork so that the
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor can verify that you really do hurt
and you can verify that your doctor is
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that you hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's asinine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say it hurts if it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the bill requires Colorado medical
board to adopt rules regarding guidelines
[SPEAKER_02]: for no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already read that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires the state agency to adopt
rules regarding guidelines for primary
[SPEAKER_02]: caregivers to give informed consent to
patients at the primary level that the
[SPEAKER_02]: product they cultivate or produce may
contain contaminants and that the levels
[SPEAKER_02]: of THC are not verified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey Mike, as your caregiver,
did you hear all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tested any of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the warning label on my last
pickup says.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am giving you informed consent to my
patient that the product I have cultivated
[SPEAKER_02]: or produced may contain contaminants and
that the THC levels are not verified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't put any contaminants on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that because I watched the state
take away your right to verify your THC
[SPEAKER_03]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got it back now with this bill at
least.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to put together a group of
people to decide how and if you get
[SPEAKER_03]: access.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not quite the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we let him play?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big if.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bill requires all primary
caregivers to register with the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the state health agency and the state
medical marijuana licensing authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any primary caregiver who is not
registered shall register within 10 days
[SPEAKER_02]: of being informed of the duty to register.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a person fails to register after such
10 days, the state health agency and
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing authority shall prohibit the
person from ever registering and acting as
[SPEAKER_02]: a primary caregiver.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have a stick to whack at you
with some of their other rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now if they catch you as an
unregistered caregiver, they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you 10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't register in 10 days,
you can't ever carry it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even tell me how or where to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill you have to require with the
state health agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the MED website, you can
download the voluntary registry form that
[SPEAKER_03]: they've had up there for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that they've put a new form
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when this is signed into action,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This got signed Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all caregivers, you guys have 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time this episode comes out,
we'll all be fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll know the 10 day time limit is like
if a cop comes to your door and goes,
[SPEAKER_03]: are you a caregiver?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, are you registered?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if the MED decides to mail all you guys
letters saying, you know, this is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be received on the 1st or whatever,
then you've got 10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could fully pull that too and call
that notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill requires the licensing authority
and the state health agency to share a
[SPEAKER_02]: minimum amount of information necessary to
ensure that a medical marijuana patient
[SPEAKER_02]: has only one caregiver and is not using a
primary caregiver and a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: center.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I'm a caregiver and I take good
care of my patients, you guys get love and
[SPEAKER_02]: any caregiver should be hooking up their
patients a little bit, give them some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, take care of them, make sure
they're not hurting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they come over like my back hurts,
you get out a fat dab of CBD and you fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that caregiver or that patient
should not be going to another caregiver
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting love from two people and
spoiling the whole game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or signed up with multiple people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of shop hoppers when
shops were still able to do sign with us
[SPEAKER_03]: and get blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would just go from shop to shop and
sign up with aid in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then get all kinds of free shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each shop would be under the
assumption that they were growing your
[SPEAKER_03]: six.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it led to some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then here's another fund bill,
a fund bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says this bill permits money,
monies in the marijuana tax fund to be
[SPEAKER_02]: used to fund the implementation of any
bills approved by the marijuana revenues
[SPEAKER_02]: interim committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of the, uh, marijuana tax money
they want to, now they will be able to use
[SPEAKER_02]: that to implement all of the bills
approved by the committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later in the bill, they dole out a couple
of hundred grand to random stuff that was
[SPEAKER_03]: never approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: This it's just fugly from here on out
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the downer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, uh, what do we want to read?
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple of things in this,
which one do you want to hit on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just a couple of bullet points on
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you're limited to 36 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's five plants or five patients,
six plants per patient plus your own six
[SPEAKER_03]: 36.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, unless you special register all of
your extended plant count cards,
[SPEAKER_03]: which in which case you can grow up to 99,
uh, after 99 plants, you have to become a
[SPEAKER_03]: licensed marijuana business, which
requires buying a building and business
[SPEAKER_03]: permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep it under 99 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the next, the nastiest little
paragraph I saw that I haven't seen any of
[SPEAKER_03]: the news pickup yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it bans caregivers from working for
medical or rec shops in any way?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be an owner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be an employee.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't even visit, uh, limited access
areas as a visitor or a guest or on a
[SPEAKER_03]: tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I'm looking for right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking for that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can pull it up on my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a picture of that paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and give it a read.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in order to be a primary caregiver who
cultivates medical marijuana for his or
[SPEAKER_03]: her patients or transports medical
marijuana for his or her patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, he or she shall also register the
locate, uh, set the wrong paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a primary caregiver, if he or she is a
licensed as a medical marijuana business,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, associate director and part,
um, as listed under article, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of numbers in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a primary caregiver can't be an
employee contractor or other support staff
[SPEAKER_03]: employee, an owner, a licensed entity,
uh, pursuant to article 43.3 or 43.4 of
[SPEAKER_03]: title 12 Colorado revised statute or
working in having access to a restricted
[SPEAKER_03]: or a licensed premise pursuant to article
43.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys, I'm terrible at reading aloud,
but basically what that says is primary
[SPEAKER_03]: caregivers cannot work in any rec or
medical shops period, uh, under any sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got an MED badge and you go
to work at a dispensary, you can no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: grow your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can no longer grow somebody else's
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you could grow your own,
but you can't be a caregiver for anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just grow your own, but you can't,
I couldn't, uh, yeah, there's a paragraph
[SPEAKER_03]: in here that says they can't stop you from
growing and your rec plants or your own
[SPEAKER_02]: personal six medical plants, but you
cannot be a caregiver anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are a caregiver right now and
you work at a dispensary, you've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure something out.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do they have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this bill went into effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a, I mean, people had plants
growing, you know, there was technically
[SPEAKER_03]: it went in, uh, it was signed into law on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it took effect on Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be like a six month grace period
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some sort of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you can't just say, Hey,
you have to find new a way of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly, haven't seen anyone else talk
about this section of the bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure the implications of it and
what that's going to do throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry has really been considered by
anybody but the two of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I cut and paste all of this bill into
the notes of this show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some sort of, is that legal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you could link it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put this into the show notes,
you guys, so that you can read it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the part that really pisses me off is
the part about being a primary caregiver
[SPEAKER_02]: and working in a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been bragging on this show for months
now that I have become the master grower
[SPEAKER_02]: at the spot dispensary and, uh,
the time is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very near.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I haven't, uh, I haven't actually
can't call myself a full on employee yet
[SPEAKER_02]: because they haven't paid me yet for my
salary because it's not time for that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they don't have the building done
that you're going to work in yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn close buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word that I saw pictures a couple of weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks real close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in there a lot lately,
uh, giving advice and helping them set
[SPEAKER_02]: things up and telling them where to put
things and kind of doing this and doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that and getting excited too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a solution, but I hope everybody
else, uh, has a solution, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are going to have to
scramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Joe loves me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a solution before this came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know this was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought ahead on accident and didn't
know that was why I had that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that are going to
have to scramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a half dozen people in your
position already that they work in a shop
[SPEAKER_03]: eight hours a day and they care give on
their free time because they have forever
[SPEAKER_03]: caregivers are what brought this whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: To where it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I learned how to do what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So well, it's where the shop wanted me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caregivers were the medical marijuana
industry in Colorado from 2000 to 2008
[SPEAKER_03]: period.
[SPEAKER_03]: There weren't shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were a medical marijuana patient,
it's because you knew a caregiver and it
[SPEAKER_03]: developed a great relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: The caregivers were the ones back in the
day, taking a lot of the medicine to the
[SPEAKER_02]: shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of what our, we knew that
that's where the inventory came from up
[SPEAKER_03]: until like 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most of the inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the shop, Mike and I had was grown
either in my old basement in that house in
[SPEAKER_02]: the old part of town over there or from
other friends of mine that were doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: same damn thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that crazy old guy that used to
come and bring us product?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the short time I was there,
I saw a half dozen different people walk
[SPEAKER_03]: in with the shoulder bag and the terrified
look, asking to talk to the manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they got to come back in a little
back room and show me their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I met the guy with the Hindu
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I met the guy with the
Alaskan Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone is still full of contacts I made
running that counter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run into people from there all over town
and there's always that weird moment of
[SPEAKER_03]: eye contact where he went, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's where I know you from.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, I really encourage you to
go read this bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's SB 15-014.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a Colorado medical marijuana
patient, a Colorado recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer, if you're listening to the show,
this bill applies to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever thought of growing plants,
this is something you need to read right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to change everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're far away and wondering what any
of this has to do with you, this is what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens when the community doesn't stand
up and speak for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he gets railroaded and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said at the beginning of the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right down our throats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that this shit was
coming up to vote on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I watched it come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched it work its way through the
Colorado process and I watched people
[SPEAKER_03]: argue and fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read the articles and sent the emails
and there was some progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original bill was a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm cool, calm and collected right
now, but I've got some things to change in
[SPEAKER_02]: my life because of this bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half of me wants to scream and smash
because this is really, really ugly and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to do a lot of harm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a solution to everything on our
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what we're going to do already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm not worried about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm worried about the three or four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's like 4,000 caregivers in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to guess that 2,000 of them work
in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's definitely 4,000
caregivers in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 2,000 is kind of a guess, but still
that's 2,000 people that either have to
[SPEAKER_03]: come up with a sketchy workaround or quit
their job.
[SPEAKER_03]: One or the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to fire the five people you're
providing medication and caregiving for,
[SPEAKER_03]: or do you want to quit your day job that's
your income?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can't make money being a
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can recoup your bills, but that's not
the same thing as getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The day job funds the caregiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the day job, you can't afford to
care give because you got to pay for the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need a new gear, could your
patients come up with that money?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you got money?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I blew a light bulb right now,
do you have 200 bucks to replace the bulb?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out of my pocket every time I
replace the bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go sell my car real quick and buy
you a bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a transmission we're trying to
replace right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not talk about replacing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Dario's getting that
transmission fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we got like 42 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything you want to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Register to vote and start paying
attention to politics and hopefully we can
[SPEAKER_03]: stop getting just fucked as a community
like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then go vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an election this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's talking about 2016 and who's
going to be the next president.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an election between now and then
that no one's really talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in Pueblo, it's real important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be voting on rec shops in
the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: You told me that I kind of messed up the
last report I said on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct me because I don't want to be
wrong on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was episode 69 or 70.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember which.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you covered recently, the Pueblo City
Council voted not to license rec shops in
[SPEAKER_03]: the city and they punted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the voters are going to decide on
some marijuana question or another in
[SPEAKER_03]: November.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council has no idea what they're
going to ask the voters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be the 11 page nonsense
ordinance they didn't vote on last Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully it'll be a short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want rec stores in the city?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes or no, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I asked city council directly,
I got a snarky response from one of them
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, show up to those meetings and find
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and before I've said I'm
impartial to rec stores in the city,
[SPEAKER_02]: but bring it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a rec store on our city.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need those jobs and taxes period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo is a poor city full of poor people
who need jobs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can give us 12 jobs by opening
and opening a dispensary, that's 12
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something I've noticed that
people our age, the 24 to 35 range that's
[SPEAKER_02]: been kind of fucked for the past 10 years,
it finally got something to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that got out of college and
realize that there's nothing to fucking do
[SPEAKER_02]: with that college degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to look you straight in the face
when I say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my sociology degree makes shit less
confusing to me personally, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: do fuck all for my bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to work in a dispensary now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's finally got something for you to do
because of this industry and it's helping
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do support a dispensary in the city
of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: If my opinion matters to you at all,
vote yes when it comes time to ask about
[SPEAKER_02]: opening dispensaries in the middle of
town, because we need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you're registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure your friends are registered to
vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure your lady or your man are
registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're out here and you've got a crew
and all of you are in those nice ass hats
[SPEAKER_03]: with those pins, make sure you're
registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gateway to politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have cared about politics at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been one of my talking points for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not have cared about politics and
voting and gone to city council and shit
[SPEAKER_02]: at all had I not gotten involved in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is the gateway drug, man,
to politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've survived for so long by being
invisible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was how we thrived and survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were invisible.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one noticed us and we stayed out of
everybody's line of sight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now if we don't all stand up real
soon, we're not getting to have legal
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana in any state anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys that have cannabis legalized in
your states, be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington just fucked up royal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you read about that today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so much news that I don't know
what happened in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain is overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was focused on this show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back maybe six, eight months ago,
Colorado's, they did the first underage
[SPEAKER_03]: bi-sting and they hit 20 dispensaries in
Colorado and up and tall and proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not one of them failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to go boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I congratulated them on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just stung Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four of 22 failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you fuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope somebody fire bombs your fucking
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they take your license and shit in
your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Mike's opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree, but not as fiercely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That does suck, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We give you the opportunity to make a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent them a letter a week in advance
saying, we're going to sting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And four of them did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give one of those credit to a
stupid ass employee.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people should be crucified at
Hempfest next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we're going to fucking have this
business that you're allowed to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: billion dollars with and sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're letting us play.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like moms away and your dad's like,
sure, you could watch Playboy while she's
[SPEAKER_02]: gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're jerking off in front of the
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's zip it up and do this right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire bomb them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry I defended that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't really fire bomb them,
but if you shot, pull them up,
[SPEAKER_03]: the store names are in the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in Seattle and you used to
shop there, don't anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have to pee when you're walking
past, hit up their window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I can support that
statement on the show because when their
[SPEAKER_03]: window gets pissed on, this statement is
brought to you by white Mike, not the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that Mike's got us pissing on
windows, I think it's almost time to wrap
[SPEAKER_02]: up the damn show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not prompt him for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: She don't listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to remind all my friends to say hi
to their wives when they're on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for dinner, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Hey girl, my wife, my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did my wife this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it the whole show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Doug Benson and I was in the front
row and he said, my wife on stage or
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody else said, my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went, my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife after him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the people on stage heard me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of awkward for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow Mike on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

I'm going to put this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, I'll be back in a couple of
days with another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not forget about that perpetual grow

[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've been writing that and
more shit keeps popping up to do shows
[SPEAKER_02]: about.

[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike was around and I was like,
let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was looking for something to do.
