[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 96 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even speak today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you on a lovely Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bonus Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, why not put out a Thursday
episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the Monday episode was pretty
short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after I put out the Monday episode,
right after I recorded the Monday episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to go look at the news and there
was another news article that I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys need to know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this episode, it's going to be a
quickie, just going to be a midweek
[SPEAKER_00]: quickie, a Thursday bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoy it, but I want to
talk about a news article and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about something that I saw
while doing a consultation at somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to give you a little bit
of guidance and help you improve
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into this news article that
made me want to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says Denver issues two more pot
recalls of pot containing unapproved
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are at it again, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from The Cannabis and
it is written by our friends, David Magoya
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right down to bid myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Owners of two Denver marijuana growing
facilities on Friday said they were
[SPEAKER_00]: voluntarily recalling their products after
city health officials learned tests found
[SPEAKER_00]: unapproved pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recall of an undisclosed amount of
plants and edible products is the second
[SPEAKER_00]: issued by the Denver Department of
Environmental Health in just over a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: underscoring the city's enforcement
efforts on companies allegedly using
[SPEAKER_00]: disallowed chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department officials said retailers should
either destroy the recalled products or
[SPEAKER_00]: return them to the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers who have the product should
return them to the store of purchase or
[SPEAKER_00]: dispose of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them back, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get your money back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Owners of the two impacted businesses,
Summit Wellness, which operates as Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: Rec, Denver Recreational Dispensary,
and Sacred Seed confirmed they were
[SPEAKER_00]: removing products from their store
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver Rec owner James Monaco told the
Denver Post about the recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working through the process and
we'll have a statement on our Twitter feed
[SPEAKER_00]: later tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sacred Seed recall apparently was the
result of pesticides a rogue employee
[SPEAKER_00]: secretly applied in the middle of the
night without permission, CEO Jeremy
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilburn told the Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that just an excuse, you guys,
or do you think that that really happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they really had a rogue
employee go in the grow rooms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the night and spray pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that pesticide had to be in the damn
building for that dude to put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means he had to go to the store,
he had to buy a pesticide, he had to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: to work, he had to wait for everybody else
to leave, he had to mix that shit up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he had to spray this shit on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna call them out and say
bullshit, but I might say that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: completely sure I completely buy that
whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how would they know that a rogue
employee did that if nobody ever said
[SPEAKER_00]: anything until the shit was tested and
found spray on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they just go, oh yeah, that was that
time that that guy did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they just made that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I talk about it, the more I feel
like they are just using that as a cop
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I wanna get back into the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next paragraph lists all of the Origin
RMCF numbers on all of the products that
[SPEAKER_00]: are recalled because I don't feel the need
to read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these numbers, 90% of my audience
is not in Colorado anyway, so most of you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys don't have any of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought Mahatma products,
you may want to contact the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: where you got them and you may want to get
a refund.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, as in the city's prior marijuana
recall, return products cannot be sold
[SPEAKER_00]: until additional testing clears them of
residues of the disallowed pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The businesses also have the discretion to
destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a state of shock, Kilburn said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pulled everything off of our shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self quarantined our grow and our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't wholesale, so no one has our
product out there except the small amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of trim for processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product, subject to the recall,
had been tested at Mahatma Concentrates in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, which was already under a recall
issued September 8th for its own products
[SPEAKER_00]: that had tested positive for pesticides
that state agriculture officials have not
[SPEAKER_00]: cleared for the use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city's inquiry at Mahatma extended to
several businesses that send it marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmings for processing into edible
concentrates, such as wax and shatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are then returned or distributed to
different stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of the first recall,
Mahatma began pesticide testing on all
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana trimmings that arrive in its
Denver facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that testing that found pesticides
in the latest recalled products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilburn said Mahatma informed him of the
test results and the company immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted officials at the Colorado
Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be getting it tested and
figuring out the extent of damage and
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying materials or throwing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, environmental health wants us to
do, Kilburn said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're reeling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilburn said the sacred seed employee
responsible for the pesticide misuse had
[SPEAKER_00]: left on Tuesday and offered an explanation
in a resignation letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a minor bug problem and I was
concerned we were going to lose the crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilburn said of the letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did we tell him not to use those
pesticides, we had sent him and two others
[SPEAKER_00]: to specialize pesticide handlers training
through the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unclear how Denrec learned of the
test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver inspectors said they only found
application log books for the past 30 days
[SPEAKER_00]: at Denrec and the business that older ones
had been destroyed reports show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: A letter of resignation with an apology
and destroyed evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is turning into a cannabis soap
opera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDA issued a list earlier this year of
products it says can be used on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the drug is illegal under federal
law, no pesticide is specifically approved
[SPEAKER_00]: for use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some label restrictions are so broadly
written that using the chemical would not
[SPEAKER_00]: violate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law mandates that no pesticide may
be used in a manner that is not consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: with its label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most marijuana growers are not well
informed about pesticide use and the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: behind them, CDA officials have said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what appears to solve a problem in a
greenhouse could actually be a violation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides are regulated by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Protection Agency and it
offers no information about marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: because the drug is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are not able to test pesticides
on cannabis to find out the long term
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, to find out how long that product
stays in the cannabis, to find out how
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it actually makes it to the
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal to test these pesticides on
cannabis in the way that we need to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: to find what combats our problems because
cannabis is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys know where I'm headed
with this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The solution to this problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys all want to say it with
me, legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can test this shit properly and
we'll solve this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make money off of, the testing
labs would make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another avenue of revenue right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are more products being recalled,
you guys, because of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mahatma Concentrates has actually taken it
upon themselves to start testing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that comes in before they run
it, before they do the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are testing all of the material that
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give kudos to Mahatma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a bold step and that is a brave
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to pay for the testing,
which costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're also going to lose
clientele because anything that does come
[SPEAKER_00]: back with the contaminant and it cannot be
ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Mahatma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're coming to Colorado to
buy products, I want you to feel safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we're doing to make you
feel safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making sure there are not ridiculous
pesticides in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they mentioned that Department of
Agriculture applicator's training course
[SPEAKER_00]: in this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing cannabis, I recommend
that you go and read your state's
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide applicator's training manual or
certification manual, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies state by state, but your
Department of Agriculture in your state
[SPEAKER_00]: will have an applicator's training guide
or a certification guide or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn so much about pesticides,
about pesticide use, about pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn that most of these products
are all derived from the same thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are mixed with other carrier agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that alone will be a useful tool in
your ganja growing arsenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do in the future plan on doing an
integrated pest management episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two people lined up that I want
to have on that show and getting them here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time has been a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just do two separate episodes and
get them both on separate episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the news article that I wanted to
read you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep you guys updated on what's
going on here in Denver or up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in Denver, but here in Colorado up
in Denver, about a hundred miles south of
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to keep you updated on what's
going on, let you know how this pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: drama has been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to kind of give props to
Mahatma concentrates for just stepping up
[SPEAKER_00]: their game.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're testing everything now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found out they had a problem instead
of trying to hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Hey, we fucked up and look
what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to test everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a lot of people
accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the way that this industry is
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to talk about one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is just going to be a short
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a bonus Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get that news article out,
but since I'm here recording, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about something that I saw a few days
ago while I was at a consultation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when I go to a
consultation, the people will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that they need corrected,
but sometimes they just want me to observe
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing and see what we can
improve or make easier for them that will
[SPEAKER_00]: make their cannabis crop come out a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to tell you guys a little,
something about what I saw at a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultation with a client a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to kind of correct this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you're doing this
wrong or if you could be doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: better, but I'm sure that there are a
couple of people out there who will
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just watching this guy work in
his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just showed up at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we walked out there and he said,
I saved all my chores for when you got
[SPEAKER_00]: here and we're just going to do my
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I helped him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I filled some buckets and we did what we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first thing this dude did that I
corrected was this guy gets a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket and he pours his nutrients into a
glass to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he pours all the nutrients into
the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain why I am not a scientist,
but I know why these, the reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sold in different bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go by, I'm just going to use
advanced nutrients because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that it's popped up in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got, they've got a flower,
a they've got a flower bee, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like a flavor booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced nutrients has so many bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason those are all sold separately
is because if they put those products all
[SPEAKER_00]: into one container, the elements in there
will bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need to add those products
to water and never mix them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are very concentrated products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only adding a few milliliters to
five gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I'm going to say is
fill up your container that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to mix into probably a five gallon bucket,
fill that with water first, preferably
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse osmosis water, but we can't all do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your five gallon bucket with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always fill it with water first,
then add the nutrients to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mix nutrients without water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are buffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sold separately for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are buffered and chelated and they
are not meant to be mixed in concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best I can recommend is to either
mix them into a one gallon pitcher so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do make a mistake, you don't waste
five gallons of water or just mix the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients one at a time into your five
gallon bucket, but never pour them in
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate form into a container
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're causing problems already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a pitcher of water from that bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix your nutrient solution into the
pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a quality measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go get something from the grow
store or a scientific store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff you use for your kitchen is
close, but it is not going to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate as something you could get from
the grow store and do not use something
[SPEAKER_00]: from the kitchen and then put it back in
the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a dedicated one for
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be mixing your whatever
kind of food you're mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're measuring out your vanilla extract
and the same damn measuring device that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mixing up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tacky and it's unsanitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either going to get you sick or your
plants sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get some dedicated stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So measure really carefully, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be accurate with your measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says 25 milliliters, okay,
well, here's something I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottle says 50 milliliters,
probably use half of that to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never needed to use as much as
recommended on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient companies want you to buy
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommend that you use a little bit
extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't always have to use as much as
it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with maybe a half, two thirds and
work your way up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But measure carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to put in 25 milliliters,
measure 25 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down so that if something goes
wrong, you know next time that 26 or 27
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 is what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it either worked or it did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 25 is your number to go to next time
and adjust from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So measure carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just said, take notes all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should always remind you guys to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always take notes when you're growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way you know what you did
and what you didn't do and what worked and
[SPEAKER_00]: what didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're going to think, oh,
I remember doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing cannabis, which means
you're probably smoking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you're going to forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So write that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got everything measured,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taken a pitcher of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've poured your grow A into a small
measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump that into the pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour B into the measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump that in the pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then clean out your measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go clean it right now before you
do anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump that pitcher into your five gallon
bucket with water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got five gallons of
perfectly mixed water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do make a mistake, all you got to
do is dump out that pitcher and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you wasted your nutrients,
but you didn't just dump out five gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to wait for a five gallon
bucket to refill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're using reverse osmosis water,
you just saved even more because when you
[SPEAKER_00]: make reverse osmosis water, there's a lot
of water that gets thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to waste water when you're
using reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got your bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filled with your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filled with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to test the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people adjust the pH of their
water before they add the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a fail because you're going to pH
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put shit in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got all of your nutrients
in there, every single nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when you adjust the pH,
use pH up or pH down to correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys write down the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it at 6.5, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it at 6.3, write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 6.7, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in hydro, you're going lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still write it the fuck down so that when
you see those plants doing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you were right or wrong with
your measurement and you have a reference
[SPEAKER_00]: for where to go to next time, you can't
make adjustments if you don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you did last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got our nutrients mixed up in
a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it properly pHed to about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we wrote down how much nutrients we've
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to water each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you go watering the plants,
this is something that I saw my,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, my client do the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He poured the water directly in the center
of the pot, right over the stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the middle of the damn plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're using enough water,
that'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is wiser and more healthy for the plant
to start on the outer edge of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because the roots that are newer and
fresher and growing and searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: water are those outer roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get the outer perimeter of
the dirt wet, the inside of the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: there, the water will work its way in
because the roots will pull it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's envision a cannabis plant standing
there out in a field by itself or with
[SPEAKER_00]: other friends, whichever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a cannabis plant standing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves hang off of it in sort of like
a tent shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, it's like a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's protecting the inside of that plant
from moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the rain hits it, if rain comes
down from the sky, rain hits the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being brought out to the outer edge
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardly any water will land on the ground
near the stock of that plant because all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leaves are pushing it out to the
perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of believe that a plant will
grow as wide as its root mass will allow
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you water the outer edge of that
pot, then your plant's going to grow wider
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to feel like it's
getting more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that wideness of the plant should
kind of represent the root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the rain comes down, the rain will
drip off of the plant and fall right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the perimeter of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where those roots are,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it'll drink that right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also, if you water the outside of
that, it'll keep your roots active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go dumping the water right in the
middle of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of try to water around the outer
edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're going to want to soak the
soil anyway, but make sure you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: outer area wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important part, not right there
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good way to do that, you guys,
if you have time, and I hope you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a little mound around your stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grab a handful of the soil in the pot
and just kind of make a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: a conular shape like a mound around the
stock so that when you water, the water
[SPEAKER_00]: runs down that and runs towards the edges
of the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is try to get the water to the
outer edge of the pot, not so much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a couple of things that I saw at
a consultation that I thought I would
[SPEAKER_00]: share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, clean up after yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do something tomorrow that could be
done today, because when you start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: lazy as a grower, that's when you fall
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when shit gets messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When shit gets behind and messy is when
you have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing on a professional
level and you're trying to have
[SPEAKER_00]: professional quality buds for yourself and
your clients and your patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you, whoever else you're growing
for, you need to be in there every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be diligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be on top of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing can wait until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it needs to be done today, you should
probably get in there and do it today,
[SPEAKER_00]: because plants are only alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, your plants are
only alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in flower for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants only live for about 100 days
indoors, maybe 120, 150 at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've only got 150 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not make every single day for your
plant count?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your patients will know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your flowers will show it in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be well worth your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about
defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been experimenting with defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is, is just going and taking off
all of the big fan leaves early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put two plants side by side,
the same exact strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a Jeff's OG because it's something
I'm very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tore off all of the fan leaves on
one plant about a week into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the fan leaves, if there was a
petiole, I'd cut that leaf off at the
[SPEAKER_00]: petiole right at the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant looked completely naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just a bunch of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds up a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one next to it looks like a big
leafy pot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time went on, the leaves grew back,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and cut those leaves off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it about every seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in there cutting off major amounts
of leaf off of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started growing so much leaf toward
week six that it looked just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant next to it that I had never
defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was spitting out a lot of leaf,
but I kept cutting them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just little tiny leaves just
trying to grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't getting too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my first time trying it,
but I noticed that the lower buds got
[SPEAKER_00]: chunkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it would work that way
because my opinion has always been that
[SPEAKER_00]: those bigger leaves were the solar
collectors that got all of the light from
[SPEAKER_00]: my plant that gave the plant energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to experiment more with this
defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed I get a little better
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants seem to be just happier when I
cut down a lot of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you have some leaves that
are shadowing a bud or if your plant looks
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit too leafy, I encourage you to
choose one plant in your garden and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with a little bit of extreme
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go extreme if you don't
want to, but if you want to, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will handle it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got on the one plant that I did
not defoliate, it was in a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got five and a half ounces of Jeff's OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the plant that was defoliated,
I got six and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's three quarters of an ounce,
which is not a whole lot of a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go by a whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's still 21 grams of cannabis just
by cutting off some leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did everything else the same,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants looked very similar up until
that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit of defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any comments or if you
want to know more about that, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something I was playing with
in my garden and I thought I would share
[SPEAKER_00]: it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to wrap up this bonus
Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys for hanging out with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good makeup for my short
episode last week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of a 130 minute, you guys got 220
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I really appreciate you guys for
listening to me and supporting the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot, a lot of listens
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go and check out some stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are really paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would truly appreciate is if you
went to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_00]: find the review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a five star rating on there and
type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the show
and I will read your comments on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that I want you guys to leave
comments and give me a five star rating is
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what moves me up in the
ranks in iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I move up in the ranks in iTunes,
more people will see the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put my logo up there in the hot
shit section somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people will click and they will
listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then more people will learn how to grow
quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people that are learning to grow
quality cannabis, which will mean there's
[SPEAKER_00]: more quality cannabis available for
everyone to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: English is getting hard, so I'm just going
to end this show already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, don't forget that the show is
available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single episode is always and
forever archived on iReadGeneticsColorado
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check me out on all the
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not on something, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm wrapping up this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's burning out and words are
getting hard, so it's time to go take some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I almost missed a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
See you next time.
