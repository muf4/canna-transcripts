[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_00]: And you know I do include that link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I got all the
business out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right here into this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently on social media I saw something
that kind of bothered me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A member of the Irish Army, a friend,
made a mistake in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually had an equipment failure and
a lot of people they jumped on that person
[SPEAKER_00]: and they gave them a bunch of negative
feedback, a bunch of negative criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feedback was kind of 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people said you can do it,
just try again, grow harder, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people were very not super kind about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, people are going to make
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person took it to heart when you guys
talked trash to them, kind of messed up
[SPEAKER_00]: their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make mistakes in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equipment is going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna mess up schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna mis-measure some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are gonna die, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Life goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to grow again so that you've
got some good weed to smoke next time when
[SPEAKER_00]: shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give up if you make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode about making
major mistakes in grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've destroyed entire crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was halfway through a flowering crop one
year, maybe last year, maybe the year
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying new lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was halfway through a flowering crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fully seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been a great market run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys would have really enjoyed those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not satisfied with the quality of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut my losses, cleaned up, regrouped,
started over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt my little ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt my feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt my budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned a lot from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned not to use that lighting in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned not to switch lighting in the
middle of a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to use those lights
eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, when you do make mistakes,
I'm not gonna say if.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say when you do make a
mistake because it's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a robot, if you're not a
machine, and still then, those things make
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make mistakes, if you make errors,
if your plants die, it's not the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just the end of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow more weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend that made some
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually ended up with some fresh
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were well taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna give it another run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been re-encouraged or
revitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, don't let mistakes scare you
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a full episode of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast about mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about the things that I have done
to destroy plants, ruin full grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killing plants and ruining shit is how I
got good at growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get better at anything by
getting it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make a mistake, then take
notes of your mistakes, and now you know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, sometimes equipment is just
going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't help that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, yes, thank you for the great
feedback, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some amazing, awesome feedback from
the past two or three episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From episode 709, when I talked about the
evolution of dabbing, I got quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, responses, emails, and feedback
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, episode 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Pedro once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Roz and Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big thanks to the audience out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feedback, the corrections,
the comments, the concerns, all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comments are what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode got a lot of responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The YouTube comments are flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of comments there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emails are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions are being asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are watching the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, episode 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun doing the munchies
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked for like 40 minutes about
munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not mean to go on that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a super easy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys seemed to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the, first of all,
for the feedback to make that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very audience generated
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for giving me the info to
make that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thank you once again for the
feedback coming from that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm still getting feedback from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are listening to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're messaging me saying,
this is what I like to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mangoes have been real popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, that box has been popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep sending me great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those comments, all the feedback,
even the concerns, the constructive
[SPEAKER_00]: criticism, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does kind of recharge me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It refuels me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me like a little bit of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It refreshes me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you tell somebody they did a good
job, it encourages them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot coming from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: From you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm helping somebody and it
makes me feel like I'm not just talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: myself into this camera with this
expensive mic, because that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: sign of mental illness if I was just doing
this for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm getting rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of baked today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I went to the dispensary today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Doctors
Orders STEM Beach at the south end of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're down there, check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take extra good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take good care of you no matter
what at that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small little spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly ever a line, hardly ever a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can usually walk in, get the products
you need, and be on your way in just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got marvelous flowers and they
have got my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the green dot batters and
green dot rosins and green dot HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The high knap?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the FSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full spectrum extracts is what they've
got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many letters and so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I normally buy is the batter,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the batter occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, they've also got a bunch of
Incredibles Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not pay for this ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Ricky over there,
always taking good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budtender of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there today stocking up on my green
dot concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I bought named, it is named
after an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called Dali.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Dali, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you a gram of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will kick your dick in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get you rambling on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, while I was there, my good friend
Ricky, shout out to Ricky, grown that
[SPEAKER_00]: orange, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me this propaganda paper from the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana enforcement division is now
passing out this paperwork when you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to pass this to a customer
that buys concentrates in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of it says Colorado Department of
Revenue, marijuana enforcement division,
[SPEAKER_00]: use of regulated marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought this was interesting,
so I'm going to share this with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to kind of mock this a little
bit as what's really going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave this to me, which I thought was
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He laughed when he gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I have to give this to every
customer who buys a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, good, because I'm new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all people that needed some dabbing
advice, it is definitely me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the medical and retail marijuana
stores are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: This says the medical and retail marijuana
stores are required to provide this
[SPEAKER_00]: resource to individuals purchasing
regulated marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Nancy Grace when I say
marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys excuse the raspy voice also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from way too many dabs,
but life goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does say examples of a serving size
for each type of concentrate, and it
[SPEAKER_00]: describes the expected serving sizes for a
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says regulated marijuana stores offer
various categories of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stores may refer to marijuana concentrates
using different names, including but not
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to terms like shatter,
wax, butter, sugar, hash, resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they talk about all the different
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's where they get serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I once heard a guy say you can't un-smoke
that joint, can you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was fucking right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says start low and go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporizers heat marijuana concentrate to
release THC for inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The serving size should not exceed one
inhalation lasting two seconds per
[SPEAKER_00]: serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want you to vaporize the heat
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The serving size should not exceed one
inhalation lasting two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they want you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new, that'll work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hold in a dab for very long
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you get what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you just get COPD from holding in
smoke for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you're gonna get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you absorb what you're gonna
absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you take a giant dab, then I think
some of it may stick to my lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just absorb it slowly over time as
my lungs eat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: This says inhalation other than vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says when consuming regulated
marijuana concentrate by inhalation other
[SPEAKER_00]: than vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says an example dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recommended serving size is a sphere
with the diameter no larger than the dot
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you the dot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hold this up as close to that
camera as I can get it from my seat
[SPEAKER_00]: without messing everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at the size of the dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to move that around a couple of
times to where I can find an edible edited
[SPEAKER_00]: edit to edit a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say edit a bowl quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot where I can edit to where we can
put that picture and they're really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could blow it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll pick a picture of it and drop
it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that dot that's on there is not a very
big dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to do a dab that is that
size in diameter like a full ball of what
[SPEAKER_00]: that most people that might get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, that's that's going to make me
wish that you would give me a dab is all
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're telling you to inhale for one
inhalation lasting two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a that's if you're vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and then inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The serving size is sphere no larger than
the dot below, then it says risks and
[SPEAKER_00]: precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part where I got excited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of marijuana concentrate may lead to
psychotic symptoms and or psychotic
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, including but not limited to
delusions, hallucinations or difficulty
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguishing reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to what are you dabbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get some of that whatever made that
person get delusions, hallucinations and
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulty distinguishing reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: May I please?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a four gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pay cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mental health symptoms and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't list any of those, but it gives
you the the thing that it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more coming after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no stuff coming after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says cannabis, hyper emesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the first time I ever said
that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, hyper emesis syndrome or CHS,
which is known as uncontrolled and
[SPEAKER_00]: repetitive vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist, a Scientologist,
a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a podcast and I did stay at a
Hollywood in one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think CHS is probably most
likely a pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says cannabis use disorder and
dependence, including physical and
[SPEAKER_00]: psychological dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're warning you that you may you
just may get addicted to dabbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't see that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: People I don't think you get addicted to
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to do it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I don't I don't I don't
know anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm not a behavioral
therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a an addictive medicine
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to call in Dr. Drew for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, however, maybe I am addicted since
I'm justifying shit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do take breaks and I was going to
encourage you to take breaks occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow my social media,
if you watch my Instagram live you watched
[SPEAKER_00]: last year, I took a couple of one week
breaks and then I took a 12 day break
[SPEAKER_00]: where I didn't smoke any cannabis or eat
any edibles for a stretch of 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of 10 days, I said,
well, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went for 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just wanted to smoke just because I
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe just check yourself
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a little break.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if if that's something you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I consume medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you stop taking your medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need a break from your medicine,
the things that make you not sick or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do take breaks occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to clean up the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't smoke for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do take a dab,
it is fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do notice that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me get myself back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll wrap this up and then start talking
about male plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up on the paper, it says consuming
concentrates via inhalation will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when I take a dab,
if I take the appropriate size dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the time I'm done blowing it out,
I'm like, Oh, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, boo, yeah, it got me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got to let that dab kind of
sink in for a few minutes and let that
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate part of the dab kind of wear off
because it could be overwhelming when you
[SPEAKER_00]: take a monster dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come on immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says marijuana concentrates and
this is in bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana concentrates are not recommended
for inexperienced marijuana users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then back to our normal size font,
THC concentration, amount of concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed and frequency of use can result
in both short term and long term effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's moderate evidence that individuals
who use marijuana with THC concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than 10% are more likely than non
users to be diagnosed with a psychotic
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder such as schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said loose, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did say there's moderate evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have solid evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of, it kind of looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not fucking real evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says marijuana concentrate is
not approved by the FDA and claims of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical benefits are not supported by the
FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put that in there for legal
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana concentrates are not recommended
for anyone under the age of 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: except if recommended by a doctor,
people under 25, maybe at greater risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential harm because the brain is not
fully developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want you dabbing until
you're 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry kid, you got to quit dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to wait a couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says regulated marijuana stores
cannot provide medical advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are just 20 something year
old chicks and bros that definitely have
[SPEAKER_00]: no qualification to give any medical
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in there and ask them what to
smoke for your seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the strains of work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put that pressure on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put your devil magic on me,
Ricky Bobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says any questions related to the
health or safety of marijuana concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: should be discussed with a patient's
recommending physician or an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer's primary care physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a little disclaimer on the
bottom, this will be what we wrap up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risks are these risks are based on
Colorado Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment evidence statements where
there is either moderate or substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence where moderate means strong
scientific findings that support the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome but these findings have some
limitations and substantial means robust
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific findings that support the
outcome with no credible opposing
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of scientific gibberish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we did a study and nobody
challenged it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: No credible opposing scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nobody challenged it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think that says.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, it says the following
statements must be included on every
[SPEAKER_00]: container of marijuana and then it shows
you some regulations and some other things
[SPEAKER_00]: and some other stuff that doesn't really
matter on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the back here, we have a bunch of
reporting agencies, the Rocky Mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison and Drug Center, Suicide Prevention
Line, Youth and Marijuana, just weird
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda phone numbers on the back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have some problems with
something like that, please do reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: to somebody take care of your mental and
physical well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody you know is in immediate
imminent danger, please do reach out and
[SPEAKER_00]: get them the proper care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a responsible thing to say as an
adult with a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of stuff here on the
back that I really honestly found this to
[SPEAKER_00]: be entertaining when he handed it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like here, bro, I have to give you
this when you dab and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, we've been buying dabs for years and
they just now realized we needed a little
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty funny, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to talk about a mail
plant question that I got from our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, as promised, I took a drink and
now I am back to talk about a mail
[SPEAKER_00]: question that I did get from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I don't check a lot of
the YouTube comments and answer a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the questions from there because I prefer
them to come in an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to print and manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this one did get my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it came from Be Real,
but not the original Be Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is B-E-E Real, the other Be Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, how do you measure the
potency of a mail plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question with a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get buds, we get flowers, you dry them,
cure them, smoke them, enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go, that one's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get your own judgment, your own
opinions, or you can take it to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't get that option with the
mail plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a different process with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a bunch of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself on track because I do
like to start rambling, talk over my
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mail potency question, how do you
measure the potency of a mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I do when I'm growing a
mail plant and looking to work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mail plant is it's always a visual
inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have the traits you're looking
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it reach the criteria, meet the
criteria which you have set for that mail
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now potency, if it makes trichomes,
it's going to be potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the visual cues for potency,
probably the main visual cue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure it's got all the other
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potency isn't the only thing that you're
looking for when it comes to a mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need structure, vigor, shape,
resistance to pathogens, resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, appropriate flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amount of pollen that it dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of shows about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So visually look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's something you want to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be a good indicator of a
nice potent mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step, since we don't get to
smoke the mail plant, I mean you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: but DJ Short does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke the mail plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to dry them out and smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I instead, I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find multiple female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one mail plant, a dude that I
think is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why breeding takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why selection takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find one mail plant that you want to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at least how I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd grow a few males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd grow a few males and I'd look,
look visually and I'd pick one out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one that I selected, all the
others would be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the pollen would be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got a fresh room with one
mail plant, I would introduce multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants of different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be like, in my case, it'd probably
be a strawberry starburst plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a sun kiss plant, a blueberry cookies
plant, a lemon skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are all different enough in
growth, flavor, aroma, leaf shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant structure that I can tell what the
mail plant is going to add when I breed to
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would pollinate several female plants
that are different in lots of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: visually, aromatically, buzz wise,
flowering times, so that we can kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're trying to do is we're mixing
this paint with other colors to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: other colors we create.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we're doing,
but we want to be able to see the other
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and we want to see what mixes what
these two colors mix like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to put reds and blues
together to get purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a bunch of purple together,
you're just going to get more fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and you won't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to find reds, try to find blues,
try to find things that are opposite so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can blend those, breed those together,
and see what we've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step, pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first step, selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select males, select females, do a
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: One male to several female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish them, gather the seeds,
keep the seeds separate, the seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of the strawberry plant,
they're staying over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that came out of the sun kiss,
staying over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds that came out of blueberry cookies,
staying over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with all the way down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think lemon skunk was the other one I
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep all those seeds
separate, labeled, sealed, safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to grow as many as I can of
each one of those batches of seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same, as close to the same environment as
I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get somewhere between
10 and 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say the blueberry
cookies to our new male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bust out 100 seeds of those
and grow them and see what I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about, I'm going to note
the growth structure, the speed of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, the leaf shape, the shape of the
plant, different phenotypes that I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any weird anomalies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any weird mutations or strange
things that I notice in that batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make all of the notes you can think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, once you've grown that batch,
run another batch of something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the blueberry this time,
let's do the strawberry next time because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got blueberry and kind of funky
skittles and you got sweet strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum, watermelon, let's do that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run the strawberry to our new male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, look for anomalies,
look for growth structure, look for shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: look for any sort of things that stand
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document everything that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do this with all of the
seeds that we have made with every batch,
[SPEAKER_00]: the strawberry, blueberry, sun kiss,
and the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we're going to start to see is
what that male adds to the mix with each
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because if you only pollinate one
plant, then you only know it's kind of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it, a 50-50 crapshoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's what it does, but if you
pollinate multiple different females,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can see what that male does,
what it provides, what it offers to other
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants when you breed to it because
it's all about the combination of what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a new plant that outperforms the
original plant in a couple of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also need vigor, structure,
resistance, potency, aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all of that stuff and it needs to
be better than the original plant we
[SPEAKER_00]: started with or we're not doing the plant
any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moving backwards in the evolution of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollinate a bunch of females,
grow them out, then take a lot of notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what you've got, then compare your
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the grower, as the breeder,
this will start coming to you naturally as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, oh, I added, let's just say
that your male, maybe I'm going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to guess chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate's a good flavor, a good trait,
something we would all enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say that male adds
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that yet, but we're going to
breed that male to blueberry, strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: orange, and lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pa-dow, it happened, now we grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're starting to get, in the
blueberry, I noticed like a chocolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark chocolate, blueberry, peanut butter
sort of a smell going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes have a lot of
chocolate in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the strawberry out, got a lot of
strawberry turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some watermelon turps like we
expected, but then some of them have
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that male is contributing
chocolate turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it's doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I noticed that they all grow super
wildly tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what the male's doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start noticing commonalities
amongst the different crosses that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: made, and that's how you identify what the
male is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start noticing when I cross it to
the lemon skunk that I get chocolate and
[SPEAKER_00]: lemons, and that's how you say,
oh, maybe that plant puts out chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: turps, or maybe it makes, I said a minute
ago, gets really tall, or maybe you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: notice that everything you bred it to
flowers super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there could be negative traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the male plants, if they don't
get enough light, if they start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: root bound, if they get thirsty,
if they get overfed, they'll just start
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowering without you telling them
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem for a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that trait will be passed on to
its progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will start flowering whenever
there's a problem, and your customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you, or whoever ends up with those
seeds will not be happy with that if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking for a regular photo period
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to do it, pollinate them,
pollinate a bunch of females, keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds separate, grow them, observe,
take notes, then find commonalities to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what that male plant is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds like a lot of work,
and it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each pollination is going just to veg and
flower the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 100 days right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to grow out those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another 100 days right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how many you can grow,
you've got to do multiple cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could take you quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why breeders charge money for our
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we ask for a compensation for
the seeds we give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we build a reputation is by
doing that work and putting out seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know will be reliable, that you have
shown a track record that we do make good
[SPEAKER_00]: selections with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, visually pollinate,
grow the seeds, find the females,
[SPEAKER_00]: finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, here's one of the best parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to grow out these plants,
these female plants that you just made,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we find out what is really the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what you have to do next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got a bunch of seeds and
you've grown them and smoked them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to do it again with a different
male and see which one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other, what did I say,
300 days worth of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're already at two years into this
project, just finding a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why seeds get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to grow them, then you get to
smoke them, and then you get to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what those traits are that were passed
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other options that you can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send your male plant to the lab,
and they can test your male plant for the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of cannabinoid precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also test your finished plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a male plant that kicks out
flowers, you can send it to the lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get precursor plants from
multiple male plants and send those to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab and test for the presence of
cannabinoid precursors in your males,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that may help you speed up your
selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do precursory tests on males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll definitely speed up your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're able to do, let's just say
we're looking, we're gonna breed plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm looking for a female plant that is
super, we're looking for only plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are super high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a silly goal, but with this
project, it will work for what I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would grow these plants until we were
big enough to get a leaf sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only need two true leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these plants have two true leaves,
I take a sample that is the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: back end of this pin, the part you click,
the annoying part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a sample that big from each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send that sample to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lab can identify the presence of the
precursors that will later turn into THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it knows that the precursors to those
cannabinoids are available in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will say, this plant shows markers
that are high in the precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant's not so high in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is super high in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, if we were breeding for
potency, what you would do is just
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate all of the low testing number
plants at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking for boys looking for
girls, you can run the test at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time to find male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for that highly
potent female, you got her.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for that highly potent
male, you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you would do, what I would do,
since I've already eliminated the low
[SPEAKER_00]: number plants, I already know that my high
potency plants are in the batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will look for structure,
vigor, growth, aroma, color, resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the other things that may be
desirable at this point for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know that they're super potent,
so now I'm phenohunting backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already eliminated a bunch of plants
through science, through what is known as
[SPEAKER_00]: predicative testing, through looking for
the presence of cannabinoid precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume you could do that with the
male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody that is doing that
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be the first to send that bitch
in, get it tested, see what pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed the same male to several females and
experience and see what that male does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the last of my notes that I've got
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is that you have
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not having fun with your
breeding projects, if you're stressing
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself out, if it's driving you crazy,
take a big breath and step back,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke some good weed, take some dabs,
dab yourself into a state of, which word
[SPEAKER_00]: do we want to use, cannabis use disorder,
or maybe get yourself some psychotic
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms or psychotic disorder,
walk around the block, giggle a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: times, think about it, snap out of it,
then go back to the grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the drawing board, and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what it is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to create plants that
were better than the plants we started
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're very interested in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
