[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's going on podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode number 38 of the I Grow
Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you today, November 1st,
the day after Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am proud to report that nobody gave
any trick or treaters cannabis infused
[SPEAKER_00]: candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you guys and I want to say
thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of a news article
here that I want to read if I can get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a news article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from the Denver Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Halloween pot candy scare
baseless so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says police in Colorado have
warned parents to look out for potlaced
[SPEAKER_00]: Halloween candy, but parents don't seem
too worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Denver based testing company offered a
thousand free kits to parents wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: screen their trick or treaters hall for
marijuana psychoactive chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, only 45 parents took CBCCB
Scientific up on the offer as a Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been no reported cases of
people slipping marijuana into
[SPEAKER_00]: unsuspecting unsuspecting trick or
treaters in Colorado or in any other
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the popularity of pot candies in the
new retail market in Colorado prompted
[SPEAKER_00]: warnings this fall from police in Denver,
Fort Collins and Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of Halloween morning, Denver police and
the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center
[SPEAKER_00]: reported no calls about marijuana and
Halloween candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My honest opinion is that it's an
overblown fear that was created by the
[SPEAKER_00]: police, said CB Scientific CEO Bill Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company's $15 kits are usually used by
medical marijuana patients to test the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency of their weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kits include small beakers and a
liquid that turns reddish in the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC, marijuana's active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana does not have ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is a plant, so you don't need
ingredients to mix it together and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nice try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short said the free kits were available to
parents anywhere, but that nearly all the
[SPEAKER_00]: requests came from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stepped in to tell parents don't be
spooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to jump on some fear
mongering bandwagon, Short said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since January, Children's Hospital
Colorado has reported nine admissions for
[SPEAKER_00]: children accidentally consuming edible
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unclear whether those cases were from
homemade treats or edible marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased products sold at dispensers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado police have said they're just
trying to boost awareness because of a
[SPEAKER_00]: wider availability of pot candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Larimer County Sheriff's Department,
for example, said in its warning that
[SPEAKER_00]: vigilance is necessary because marijuana
candies don't necessarily appear unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC infused edibles are often designed to
look very similar to popular name brand
[SPEAKER_00]: treats, the office warned.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Washington state, the other state with
legal, sorry, I'm going to start that
[SPEAKER_00]: sentence over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Washington state, the only other state
with legal recreational pot sales,
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities have been more circumspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sheriff's detective in Pierce County,
Washington, wrote a newspaper column
[SPEAKER_00]: saying pot showing up in trick or treat
bags is an urban myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too expensive, hard to get,
and users of these products are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: laid back and not generally terrifying in
nature, the detective said.
[SPEAKER_00]: My page just refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me scroll back down to where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something going on with my
internet where I am today, so I may lose
[SPEAKER_00]: my connection a couple of times,
but we will make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too expensive, it's hard to get,
and these guys are laid back and generally
[SPEAKER_00]: not terrifying in nature, detective Ed
Troyer wrote Monday in the Tacoma Weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ed's got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too expensive, first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles at a dispensary are kind of
expensive, and people that are buying and
[SPEAKER_00]: using cannabis, most of us are not
mean-spirited people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to play tricks on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to give people cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of us have realized that if
we do that, we are fighting down our own
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point here is that I'm glad nobody gave
anybody any cannabis in the last few
weeks, but I think we were kind of a red
light, and I'm not sure if we were going
to be able to get the cannabis.
I think we were going to be able to,
but I think it's a little bit too
expensive.
This article is kind of related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everybody had a happy and safe
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other point is that that's a lot of
hype and a lot of fear, so if you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: believing that, relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as big of a fear as we thought it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everybody had a happy and safe
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to continue with this next news
article and then we'll do a couple of ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's kind of related.
[SPEAKER_00]: A part of that article that I just read
said that a lot of edibles are designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: look like popular candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from the Denver Post
and it is written by David Magoya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, The article says,
The small Colorado Springs-based producer
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana edibles sued in June by candy
giant The Hershey Company for allegedly
[SPEAKER_00]: breaching a number of design and name
patents quietly settled the dispute.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a settlement penned in late September,
Tinkerbell agreed to recall and destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: all edibles it sold that looked like the
famed chocolate company's products or with
[SPEAKER_00]: names that played on their brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though the edibles company said it had
long ago stopped making products that
[SPEAKER_00]: appeared like those products by Hershey,
including well-known names such as
[SPEAKER_00]: Reese's, Almond Joy, and Heath long before
the federal lawsuit was filed in June in U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: District Court in Denver, the settlement
makes sure it won't happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys were making edibles and some
of them were delicious, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a Reefer's peanut butter bar
that looks just like the Reese's peanut
[SPEAKER_00]: butter bar, but it says Reefer's on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging was the same color as the
Reese's peanut butter cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could see why Hershey's kind of got
pissed at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Heath was, I forgot what they called
the Heath bar, but these candy bars look
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the original candy bar and that
could cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that if your kid saw that
sitting on the counter, which that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: should not be sitting out for a kid to
get, but if he saw that Reefer's bar
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting up there, that kid would probably
eat it and that kid would be wrecked and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be a shitty parent and then you'd be
put another mark of one of those kids in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hospital for cannabis and you'd make
the whole movement look bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the settlement also requires Tinkerbell
not to use the product names Hershey's,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja Joy, Hash Heath, Hash Eats,
Thingamajiggy, or and Reefer's,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor to use the name Reefer for any candies
that contain either peanut butter or its
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company also agreed not to make
packages with brown, yellow and orange
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, which are those used by Reese's
brand according to a copy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they can't even use any of the
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hershey pretty much cock-blocked these
guys pretty well from doing anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hershey's had said Tinkerbell's products
harmed their brand name and could be
[SPEAKER_00]: confused for regular candy by children,
which is kind of what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinkerbell neither admitted nor denied any
allegations in the lawsuit as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to get your
Ganja Joy or your Reefer's anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were super popular in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took them a little bit to get their way
out here to Colorado, but we are not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I feel like I'm talking really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fired up for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super nice day outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big package in the mail from our
friends at Sweet Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give them a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out Sweet Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll slow down and calm down
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a dab with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dab some Skatso G and Senzo G
mix grown by a Garden of Whedon and also
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted by Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is super delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what won the Secret Cup regionals in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the Shatter version and not
the live resin version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big fat chunky dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit the Hitman Phase 2 Cake
with a highly educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Infinity Nail with an e-nail
attachment on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a dab together, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you take a quarter gram dab
on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of a cough there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to cough in your ear.

[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to do another article?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read another news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one sucks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a real popular topic a few days
ago here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, this is from the cannabis is
where I'm reading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, where was it originally?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Jesse Paul and Noel Phillips
and John Ingold of the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, Denver police and feds
conduct large scale raids on marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: grow sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this article and then we'll
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver police officers, some in hazmat
suits, raided multiple marijuana growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operations Tuesday, part of an
investigation into illegal marijuana sales
[SPEAKER_00]: in Minnesota, a federal law enforcement
official said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal agents assisted in the raids,
which saw investigators haul dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity grow lights and thousands
of plants out of the operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal official said as much as $1
million was found in large bags during the
[SPEAKER_00]: searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The official who was not authorized to
disclose information about the case and
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke to the Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really chopped that word, anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading it and can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spoke anonymously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe people involved came to Colorado
from Minnesota where marijuana is illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of a restrictive medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officially authorities released little
information about the case on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver police wrote that the investigation
involved illegal drug activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a spokesman for the department later
said he did not know if the operations
[SPEAKER_00]: rated were licensed marijuana businesses
or if detectives believed they were
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver police did not announce any arrests
connected to the raids, a spokeswoman for
[SPEAKER_00]: the state marijuana enforcement division,
which regulates cannabis businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: refused to comment on whether the division
was involved in the investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, James Goath, group supervisor of
the Drug Enforcement Administration
[SPEAKER_00]: Special Support Unit in Denver,
offered little comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large and successful
investigation, Goath said.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one rated site on North Bryant Street
near West 6th Avenue, a Denver police
[SPEAKER_00]: officer was seen entering a building in a
blue hazmat suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The officer, his suit reeking of
marijuana, said several search warrants
[SPEAKER_00]: were being executed around the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rated building on North Bryant Street
is in an industrial area popular with
[SPEAKER_00]: state legal commercial marijuana growers
and increasingly illegal growers trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: hide among them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rated address was once home to the
girl operation for a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: products business, the state records show,
but it is unclear whether the small
[SPEAKER_00]: business is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis industry insiders said they
believe the address is now occupied by
[SPEAKER_00]: people claiming to be medical marijuana
caregivers, smaller scale providers that
[SPEAKER_00]: operate with less scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: At neighboring cannabis business,
employees were bewildered by the flurry of
[SPEAKER_00]: police activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate Perrini, who works at Edibles
manufacturer, Edipure, which is next door
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rated operation on North Bryant
Street, said cops already were there when
[SPEAKER_00]: she got to work around 9am.
[SPEAKER_00]: A police car was parked in front of the
shop and another was parked in the alley
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police tape had been strung around the
perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday's raids came 11 months after local
and federal authorities raided several
[SPEAKER_00]: large marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest raids on Colorado pop
businesses, excuse me, since medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana became legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four people connected to the businesses
rated then have been charged with federal
[SPEAKER_00]: crimes and prosecutors have also moved to
seize businesses, have moved to seize the
[SPEAKER_00]: business's assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, from what I have read and seen
recently and what's going on on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_00]: these facilities were not legal medical
marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were marijuana MED registered
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were caregivers who have kind of
vague rules, but they were probably out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they had that much money on them,
they were doing something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine on Facebook said that he
saw at least a hundred lights stacked up
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of one of these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine being the guys that work at
Edipure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the warehouse right here got raided and
the one right next to it did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one on the other side of it did
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's in there growing herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see all these federal agents in
hazmat suits pull up and just start taking
[SPEAKER_00]: shit apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come in with guns blazing,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, imagine having the legal business
next door and you didn't get raided and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just sitting there, shit in your
pants, waiting for them to come into your
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you're like, just come in
already because you're so freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're waiting for
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I've seen, these places were
not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this wasn't the feds taking down
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actual raids on illegal grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds weird being in
Colorado, but there are a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale illegal grows going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they'll keep taking them down too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is, this one I found on,
where did I find this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from toke of the town,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the cannabis, the toke of the
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at a lot of websites to find my
cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you have to type in the
word marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find good cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is a racist word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created with racism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It supports a racist connotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to stop saying marijuana
and let's all say cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the revolutionary term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people before us, the older folks are
afraid of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as afraid of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of, it's all about the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say the right words, you can
convince people just about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start saying cannabis and not
saying marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of this article, Georgia drug
agents bust man with okra and believe it
[SPEAKER_00]: is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of an old story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys might've heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Mike Adams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says, oh, this is really long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might summarize some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans are no longer safe to cultivate
common garden vegetables without risking
[SPEAKER_00]: the violent wrath of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other citizen understands this lunacy
quite like Georgia resident, Dwayne Perry,
[SPEAKER_00]: who told reporters that he was raided by
drug agents earlier last week after an
[SPEAKER_00]: aerial surveillance unit mistook his Oprah
crop for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears as though Georgia law
enforcement has not had enough experience
[SPEAKER_00]: taking down marijuana girl operations to
distinguish the difference between okra
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there is a picture of an okra plant
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does not look at all like pot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got big round leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are not serrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the fingery leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't look like weed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train these guys a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to summarize this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reports indicate that a drug task force
was conducting a marijuana suppression
[SPEAKER_00]: mission when officers spotted Perry's okra
plants and immediately thought he was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okra plants, incidentally, consist of five
fat leaves, while the cannabis plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: very distinguishable foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spelled foliage wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put F-O-I-O-L-I-A-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Messed my brain all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the two plants look
absolutely nothing alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that did not stop officers
with Georgia State Patrol from swooping in
[SPEAKER_00]: on Perry's residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dressed to kill is what it says here in an
attempt to destroy the suspected marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were strapped to the gills,
said Perry, explaining to reporters how
[SPEAKER_00]: the officers seemed prepared to shoot him
dead on the spot over a case of mistaken
[SPEAKER_00]: identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, these cops went in and raided
this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine when you get raided, it's
traumatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved in a couple of raids,
unfortunately, knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never in one of those again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming into your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have an AK-47.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be crazy as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are prepared for whatever you're
doing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put you on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cuff you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a gun to your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk shit to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing some kind of crime or in a
house where there's some shit going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be the type of person that's
prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have had police interaction and
you know how to handle yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude is a okra grower in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he's not experienced with
the SWAT team and the state patrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he probably shit his pants when they
came in, probably traumatized him,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably traumatized his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if there are any kids there,
they're scared shitless of the cops now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I skipped a couple of little short
paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although Perry is grateful that a trigger
happy cop did not riddle him full of holes
[SPEAKER_00]: during the raid, he says there is no
excuse for this level of domestic warfare
[SPEAKER_00]: over a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am at home and retired and,
you know, I do the right thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: said Perry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come to my house strapped with
weapons for no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several officers did apologize after
further investigating the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that simply isn't good enough,
says Perry, because the situation could
[SPEAKER_00]: have potentially gotten him killed or
seriously injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I thought about it, what could
have happened, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything could have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap up that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, Georgia police.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that that made you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that was a good way to spend your
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you scared the shit out of this old
retired guy for no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of making friends, the cops keep
making more enemies by doing shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd put down your guns and quit
trying to be soldiers and just be friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and police the community like we designed
the police for, you'd have a lot more damn
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when shit goes wrong,
the cops would have somebody to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when shit goes wrong now,
everybody disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to talk to the cops because
the cops are the bad guy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the good guy still, we'd want to
talk to you because we know you'd help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't feel like you're going to
help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel like you're going to kick my ass just
for pulling me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't be scared to pull over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops are pulling me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the guys I should trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm ranting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ridiculous article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this unfold on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was highly entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: This story is a little bit old,
but it's well worth talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done any news on the show for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been packing up such great shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a funny article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is by William Breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article is headlined, Idiot Allegedly
Rips Off Pot Grow Leaves Cell Phone
[SPEAKER_00]: Behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of fun with this one,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy named Chris Mathers from
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just read the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Mathers is apparently a thief,
but not a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this because the junkie scumbag
left his smartphone behind earlier this
[SPEAKER_00]: week while allegedly ripping off a
Colorado grower's outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of several he's allegedly burglarized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, thanks to social media, he's got the
attention of local police.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this mastermind, Mathers,
left his phone unlocked, which allowed the
[SPEAKER_00]: victim to pull up more than enough
information on the scumbag to track him
[SPEAKER_00]: down and eventually get the cops involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Details are hazy, mostly to keep the
grower's identity somewhat discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after getting over the initial horror
of seeing their harvest, still weeks from
[SPEAKER_00]: being finished, gone, the owners of the
grow were no doubt elated to find some
[SPEAKER_00]: rather concrete evidence leaking Mathers
to their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No word on how Mathers would even know
about the grow, it says in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: After figuring out that the guy left his
phone, his cell phone open for anyone to
[SPEAKER_00]: use, the grower handed things over to the
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a post from one of the grower's
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw these posts on Facebook,
and it was like watching a real soap opera
[SPEAKER_00]: or a reality show happen on Facebook all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, the victim pulled photos of a
passed out Mathers, his address,
[SPEAKER_00]: phone number, and even a list of other
grow-ups he had allegedly ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the grower's no doubt had the
inclination to go beat his head in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they wisely called the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all, pot is a legal thing to grow in
this state, and this is outright theft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of talk on Facebook
about people just going and whipping this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy's ass because we had his home phone
number, we had his address, we knew all of
[SPEAKER_00]: his friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in deep shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like this article says, it's legal to
have cannabis in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they called the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure this guy was arrested
for this, but let's read the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, for his part, Mathers sounds like
he's near rock bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower was able to pull up text
message conversations about Mathers'
[SPEAKER_00]: suboxone habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff he used to get off heroin or oxys,
as well as other pill-popping adventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, and he normally smokes dirt weed,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower found photos of the brick
bullshit he sells for 15 ounce donations
[SPEAKER_00]: on Mathers' Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should see this herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy was selling some doo-doo weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brick, it's nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like little piles of cow shit or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not look smokable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy goes and steals somebody's
crop, dude, and he drops his cell phone
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had a lot of fun with him on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: We taunted him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, people taunted him and a lot of
his friends all day long until he took
[SPEAKER_00]: down his entire Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, he did end up getting
arrested for stealing this crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is justice and hilarious justice,
if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read another ad because I've got one
more ad that I've got to read for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is brought to you in part by
our good friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live music, lifestyle, magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: www.treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna rant too long on this one,
but man, how about that Halloween fish
[SPEAKER_00]: show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody paid any attention to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a fish kid for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like a good fish show and that
Halloween show was kinda crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been ranting for at least
20 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another news article for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is really silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to read this twice because I didn't
understand and then I took a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, five, four, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sour diesel nug run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, makes my head spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's read this crazy article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is once again by our good
friend William Breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this article on the toke of the
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to stay with me because
this one is kinda crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a drink before I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dab is kicking my butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this article headline says,
and you're gonna have to pay attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming governor candidate wants to shoot
wolves because Coloradans smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming governor candidate wants to shoot
wolves because Coloradans smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says, Don Willis wants to kill
wolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wants to be governor, but right
now he's all about killing him some
[SPEAKER_00]: wolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that he's made it part of his
campaign strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, Wyoming has permitted wolf hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Willis is saying that the state should
allow the hunt despite federal protection
[SPEAKER_00]: because Colorado has legal weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wolf tags have been issued and hunters
had already made plans to start their
[SPEAKER_00]: hunts, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disruption to hunters, outfitters,
and the cost to Wyoming game and fish to
[SPEAKER_00]: refund hunting permits caused by a single
black robe judge who sits in Washington DC
[SPEAKER_00]: and has probably never been in Wyoming is
outrageous and should be defied by
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, apparently you have to live in
Wyoming to actually care about Wyoming's
[SPEAKER_00]: wolf population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Willis is now calling on hunters to go
ahead and disobey the federal order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado did just that in the legalization
of pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a federal crime to commercially grow
pot and the state of Colorado defied the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal laws and it all worked out fine,
he told the Billings Gazette, while
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully pointing out that he doesn't
think people should break federal law to
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis, nor was he endorsing
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also taunted the US Fish and Wildlife
Service saying he doubted they would
[SPEAKER_00]: enforce the judge's ruling because they
normally side with Wyoming on such
[SPEAKER_00]: matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Current Wyoming Governor Matt Meade agreed
that the hunt should go on, but stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: short of advocating people disobey the
federal protections on animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are purely shot for trophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just shoot wolves for trophy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming has successfully negotiated
against federal overreach and when
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary they have gone to court,
he said in a release.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not advocate taking an extreme stand
doomed to failure, which undermines
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming's interests instead of moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say that they are
going to pretty much monitor the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: wolves and then they will reconsider
lifting the ban on wolf hunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think this is funny that the
governor is like, hey man, they're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: pot in Colorado and the feds ain't doing
shit, so let's shoot our wolves in
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet the feds won't do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to see how that turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming up, so I might pay attention
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are I will forget all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I won't forget is a big shout
out to our friends at Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_00]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Big Denver Store at 6271
Beach Street or check out the Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: location at 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies for competitive pricing
[SPEAKER_00]: and a great selection of indoor growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys, I have one more news
article and then we're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan to have Jesse back over in a
couple of days and we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: more about building your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of cool things lined up
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have an episode about growing in
tents or hydro huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great stuff coming up,
so look forward to those episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Colorado congressman urges Oregon
to follow his state's excellent example on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys in Oregon, the time to vote is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Oregon, register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't bitch and complain if you don't
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jared Paulus said in an op-ed Friday that
marijuana legalization is sound policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: he urged Oregonians to follow in
Colorado's footsteps and vote yes on
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana in next week's
election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is approaching the first
anniversary of legally regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana for adults,
Paulus wrote in the Bend Bulletin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The implementation of our new laws has
gone smoothly overall, providing an
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent example for other states to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our success has made it clear that when
marijuana is regulated like alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can decrease crime, help fund schools
and drug education programs, and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: money out of the hands of criminals and
cartels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon voters are considering measure 91,
which would allow adults to possess up to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight ounces of marijuana at home and up
to one ounce in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxes on marijuana sales would fund
schools, law enforcement, and drug
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention and education programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the Oregon Liquor Control Commission
would regulate and monitor the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon will soon decide whether to join
Colorado and Washington in regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana like alcohol, wrote Paulus,
who previously sponsored legislation that
[SPEAKER_00]: would do just that at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than ever, I believe it's time to
change course on decades of failed
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana prohibition and demonstrate
viable effective alternatives to address
[SPEAKER_00]: the realities of marijuana today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado voters legalized recreational
marijuana in 2012 with the first sales
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning on New Year's Day, 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I don't know if I've mentioned this
on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I haven't, being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first guy to buy recreational
cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got there at like 5, 40, 6 o'clock in
the morning and sat in line and bought
[SPEAKER_00]: weed first at one of my good friends
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of made me proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, while the rollout of the new
recreational marijuana regulatory regime
[SPEAKER_00]: has not been perfect, it has largely been
deemed a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Voters supported the end of marijuana
prohibition by a 10 percentage point
[SPEAKER_00]: margin in 2012 and have continued to
support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the regulated marketplace,
teens appear to have been prevented from
[SPEAKER_00]: making illegal purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal sale of recreational and medical
marijuana has been lucrative for the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, generating about $30 million in
taxes and fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado Legislative Council forecasts
that in the first full fiscal year of
[SPEAKER_00]: legal recreational sales, the state will
rake in $47.7 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Oregon passes measure 91, the state's
financial estimate committee projects that
[SPEAKER_00]: additional tax revenues could range from
$17 million to $40 million annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: A recent study from the personal finance
site NerdWallet placed the forecast range
[SPEAKER_00]: for Oregon between $50 million and $100
million in tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Voters in Alaska and the District of
Columbia will also decide whether to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize recreational cannabis on November
4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, you know what I'm going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go vote to legalize recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in Alaska and the District of
Columbia, you better be voting November
[SPEAKER_00]: 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in Oregon, go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't bitch and complain if you don't
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a mail-in ballot, mail it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: November 4th is your day, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I feel like that's enough
of me ranting and that's also enough news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I hadn't done a news episode
in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been packing episodes really full of
a lot of stuff and been leaving the news
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start wrapping up the show,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gets a shout out this week?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big shout out again to
Sweet Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a huge shout out to Task
Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me play your music in
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you're listening to Task Rock,
TNL The Movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a huge shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, these guys don't pay for this
advertisement, but a big, huge extra thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to The Mate Factor in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ever in Manitou Springs and you
need a vegetarian treat, stop in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got great wraps and sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a dark roast mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be wired up for the whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to The Mate Factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always take good care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drive an hour to go eat there and an
hour back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how good that place is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out in the next episode because
Jesse should be here if all goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk more about building your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll have another episode that is
not about building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do an episode about grow
tents is what I think is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll start getting back on track
about more grow lessons and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do the part where we wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did I put that paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to be prepared, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, also, I do need a theme song for the
show so I can quit playing Task Rock and
[SPEAKER_00]: make a tea and that cheesy reggae song
that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any musical skills,
I like dance hall reggae, maybe a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: roots reggae beat, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something that's chill that I could
play in the background while I talk or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe at the opening of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that the show is over,
please go to iTunes and or Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for the I Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, type in a comment and let me
know what you think of the show and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: read your comments on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher and every episode is
[SPEAKER_00]: available on iRegeneticsColorado.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a couple more up throughout the
next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check us out, I Grow Culture
on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
a short episode.

your mom a hug for me.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
