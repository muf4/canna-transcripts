[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 245 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, you will not hear me
bitching about the heat in Colorado for
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a bitch, but I'm looking forward
to the fall winter season this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't hear me complain about the sun
and the heat at all for a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will hear me complain about,
somebody keeps smoking on my damn hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep buying this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this SoCal OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might've talked about it on the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this SoCal OG at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so good that it just keeps
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I take a dab of it and I blow it
out and I'm like, that was fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone keeps smoking on my hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's me you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know who's smoking on my hash,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them fucking quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get serious, ladies and gentlemen.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, let's talk about what I did over
the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to brag for a couple of seconds
before we get into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Sunday, I took my beautiful daughter,
Maya.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a 14-year-old daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a beautiful little girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about her a lot on the
podcast because it's kind of none-yo-damn
[SPEAKER_00]: business, but I took my beautiful daughter
and my beautiful girlfriend, Jenny Beth,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Denver Zoo on Sunday and we got to
go check out some animals at the zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see the silverback gorilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see some lions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see some tigers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had a bunch of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are some twisted individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had more fun making fun of the
silly humans than we actually had checking
[SPEAKER_00]: out the animals at the zoo, but that's
just the type of folks we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good-ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jenny Beth for hanging out
with my daughter and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to Maya Luna for hanging
out with my girlfriend and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Maya will listen to this
podcast, but I love you, kiddo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you listen someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The zoo was a good time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a whole bunch of great stuff,
a whole bunch of great animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole bunch of great birds and reptiles
and fishes and other stuff of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing at the Denver Zoo that kind of
tripped me out, they are doing zoo
[SPEAKER_00]: dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So occasionally, you'll be walking through
the zoo and you'll hear a roar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A roar that confuses you if you don't know
there are dinosaurs at the zoo this week
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was like, what the fuck animal
is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was intense, it was loud,
it was really bassy, and I could hear it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a long ways away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a real animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people are going, they had dinosaurs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not real dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they are animatronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are robots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to confuse some little kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're teaching little kids that
the dinosaurs were years ago, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to go to the zoo and they're
going to see dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the books are lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I goddamn seen dinosaurs at the zoo last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to go to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some little kid's going to go to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, I saw a
dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the teachers are going to be like,
no, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dinosaurs at the Denver Zoo,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that confusing to kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the zoo, I took my beautiful
daughter home and the lovely, always
[SPEAKER_00]: lovely, always beautiful Jenny Beth and I,
we got to go to Cervantes Other Side and
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what I think is my favorite reggae
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've called them my favorite reggae band
enough times that I think I believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go see Morgan Heritage at
Cervantes Other Side in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pretty good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed up fairly early.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see the opening act.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were called Red Sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were good, but I don't know that they
were the appropriate opening act for
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a little more like fortunate
youth, more on the sublime side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of would have fit in with the Mystic
Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite the roots rock reggae sort of
thing that you should have had opening for
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Heritage in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, they brought a different crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people came.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Morgan Heritage came on stage and Jenny
Beth and I walked directly to the front of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stage is about waist high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny Beth was directly in front of the
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right behind her was me protecting her
from all the other idiots up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something weird that happens late
at night when people are up front at a
[SPEAKER_00]: concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see everybody get this glazed
look on their face once the drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol start kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just go full retard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they can ram into you and bump
into you and push you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being 6'5 and having dreadlocks to my
ass, I can make it clear to the drunk
[SPEAKER_00]: people that the space I am standing in and
the space I am protecting for my
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend, that is my space and I will
not move.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hold our ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to spend a little bit of your
time kind of claiming your space and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting your elbows up occasionally
because people get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I protected the miss, the always
beautiful, always lovely miss Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protected her pretty well from the drunken
idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't get plowed into too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see the band up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so close that I could hear Peter
Morgan's voice coming out of him before it
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the microphone and before it went into
the sound system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that man has an amazing fucking voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Morgan from Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my favorite vocalists ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's got mad style.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's got mad flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: His voice is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like the way that dude performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: His brother, Gramps Morgan, off to the
right side of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: My right of him, it'd be his left,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Gramps Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could hear him sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's got a deep, rich voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a big, infectious smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just looks like a big Jamaican teddy
bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just looks like such a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Mojo Morgan on the other side of the
stage plays percussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He raps a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's just always got the biggest,
cheesiest smile on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't sing a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's more kind of a rapper sort of a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does his own little raps in parts of
the songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could hear these guys' voices before
they were hitting the microphones and
[SPEAKER_00]: their harmonies together, their voices
individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys have some fucking talent,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the richest voices that I've
heard in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunday, we see Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive back to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday, I go to work, kind of dragging ass
because Sunday was a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long fucking night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get home till super late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get to bed till even later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to get up, had to go to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have been a little silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have been a little bit loopy,
but I made the best of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on Tuesday, I went to work again.
[SPEAKER_00]: After work, came to the house and got
cleaned up a little bit and met up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the always lovely, always beautiful Miss
Jenny Beth and her and I headed up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs to the Black Sheep to see
Morgan Heritage once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great show on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opening act once again was a great
opening act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot remember their name right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project 234, Project 324, Project 423,
Project and then numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had two, three, and four, but they were
not in the correct order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project 324 is what I want to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not certain, but Project something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a good band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked their style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their drummer played some really great
fills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their guitar player was fucking talented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their bass player held it down and the
other guitar player, the rhythm guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: he played some really nice rhythms with
like really nice lead parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed into the rhythms is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That band was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe once again, not the appropriate
opener for Morgan Heritage, but music is
[SPEAKER_00]: music, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an opening act to start the
party, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Heritage came on stage and I headed
directly to the front of the venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny Beth and I were directly in front of
Peter Morgan once again all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on the first night, there were
about 80 to 100 people in the venue,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the Sunday show or on the Tuesday
show at the Black Sheep, there were maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 or so people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 30 people at the show and the
band still gave it their all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still performed like they were at
Reggae Sunsplash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They performed like they were at Reggae on
the River.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave their full big show just like
they normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played mostly the same set on both
nights with a couple of variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They switched out a couple of songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really happy to hear Moscow Square
on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a good song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from one of their older albums,
which I really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not play What We Need Is Love on
the second show, but they did on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: show, which came from my favorite album of
theirs called More Teachings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both those songs came from that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They opened both nights with Strictly
Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They closed both nights with Reggae Night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do She's Still Loving Me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do SILA, of course, and a bunch of
great songs in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there weren't very many people there
at the Tuesday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were up front once again and there was
a moment when the reverb was so loud that
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't figure out what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The singer would sing into the microphone
and then it would take like this long
[SPEAKER_00]: for...
[SPEAKER_00]: So he would be like, here is my lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would hear this much delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would go, here is my lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he couldn't even... I could tell he was
becoming frustrated by all the reverb.
[SPEAKER_00]: He couldn't hear himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't hear him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were so close that I was hearing
the stage sound in front of me and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the house sound behind me and all the
sound was mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been better to back up about
10 feet just because of the sound of that
[SPEAKER_00]: venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was so close that I could hear feel
and see the drums coming off of the drums,
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the sound coming off the drums before
they went through the speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was loving that because I was
hearing the tone of those drums and just
[SPEAKER_00]: watching that drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know the drummer from Morgan
Heritage's name, but that dude is bad ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure the bass player for Morgan
Heritage is Toots Hibbert's son or
[SPEAKER_00]: grandson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's young, so I'm going to say grandson.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids, the bass and drummer looks
like 19 and 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are barely 21 if they're 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some young cats and that rhythm
section fucking held it down and tore it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Heritage has a new backup singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lady in the band, a sister,
Una Morgan, who I don't know why,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she has left the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that it's a health reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot be positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming it's a health reason just
from things I've observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Una hasn't been with the band for the
past couple of tours that I've gone to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this band two or three times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't been on tour with them for at
least the past two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Jenny Beth has ever seen
them with Una, which kind of gives me an
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator of how long she's been gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have another backup singer named
Natasha, who seemed a little bit shy at
[SPEAKER_00]: first, but once she gets in the groove,
that girl really gets in the groove and
[SPEAKER_00]: she's got a hell of a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever hear this, you're doing a
great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be so shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I saw Morgan
Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw them twice and it was fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get to listen to Morgan
Heritage, I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for some of the older stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for the More Teachings album,
then work your way on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a plethora of varieties they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do roots rock reggae, they do dance
hall reggae, they do dance lovers reggae,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do some of that R&B kind of sounding
reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of stuff to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love Peter Morgan's voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the high-pitched singing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really love Gramps' voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the low-pitched singing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they put the sister in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all mix up super well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to quit
talking about concerts that I get to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like I brag too much,
but I love music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy and I like sharing part of
my world with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me say that, let me wrap this up by
saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday night, I get to shake hands and
hang out with Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my picture taken with all the guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Jenny Beth for taking a great
picture of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the Black Sheep for throwing
a great show and also big thanks to Morgan
[SPEAKER_00]: Heritage for a great two nights of reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggae music's like an attitude
adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a mood shifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a guy that works too hard and
gets frustrated with the world can use a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of an attitude adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode number 250 is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap, I'm five episodes away from
episode number 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when I started this podcast,
I was like, I'd like to get 100 episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I got like 50 episodes in,
I was like, shit, I'm going for at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost at 250, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no intentions of ever stopping this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do this as long as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a fucking struggle to get
behind a microphone and spit out an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: or 30 minutes of material every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to find the time to organize the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to sit here and talk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to stop doing it because I
love doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sharing part of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sharing me with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love helping you with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting cannabis freed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are, I think I am dispelling
myths about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breaking the truth to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the fear out of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm teaching people to take better care of
their gardens and themselves by talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm helping people fight cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm helping people take care of a
family member who is sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing this podcast because I know
that every episode I put out, I help at
[SPEAKER_00]: least one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm just helping one person with
every episode, it makes it well worth my
[SPEAKER_00]: time and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I would be doing the world and
myself a disservice by not sharing all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit that I have learned with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've absorbed a lot and I've got a good
brain and I like to talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's kind of my
responsibility to put this out here for
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for me to quit doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the new goal, I'm going to say
500 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of, that's 250 more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I hit that, we're going to
aim for a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even like that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like a give up number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan made it to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Joe Rogan can do it, I can definitely
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude puts out like three or four
episodes a week, but he's at a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel like I'm super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to press pause on this
recording for just a brief moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of gigantic
dabs and then I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it'll be a little calmer and
then we'll work on some emails from some
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, join me for a dab
and I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated and well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed the reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you took a couple of dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed some space bitch and it made me
one spacey bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're smoking at GFYH
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, I read an email about
folks who wanted to move somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to move from Georgia to Colorado
and get into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sent me a little bit of an
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read the whole email,
but I want to read some of the important
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, I just listened to 241.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned reading some emails from
Georgia and Florida listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you were referring to my
email, but I went back and read my email I
[SPEAKER_00]: sent and I wanted to clarify a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I've been inspected and consulted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded a bit pretentious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I meant was I've passed out a lot of
info forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people I have helped come from the old
Southern school of thought that if it
[SPEAKER_00]: ain't broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These individuals are good, simple living
people just trying to avoid the traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've helped with bug, helped with bug and
deficiency problems, such as cornworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: cow mag deficiency, salt lock in mother
plants, hot zones and flower rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: different plant training techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he keeps going for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I wanted to read this guy's email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, most of the info I have has come
from you, Subcool and my book collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if you're getting info from myself
and Subcool and good books, you are off to
[SPEAKER_00]: a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I listen to 10 plus
hours of podcasts and eBooks a day as I
[SPEAKER_00]: slave away at my structural, that's harder
to say than it looks, structural steel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabrication job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of info and just want to
pass it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into the industry for
the money, but for a better future for my
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, I feel the need to
be part of the movement to keep corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: America from taking what so many before us
have sacrificed to give us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good reason to want to get
into it because that corporate takeover is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a corporate industry now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, PS Irma has been the worst
ripper ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: LOL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smoke a fat dab and hug your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're supposed to hug your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to take a fat dab and then
you hug your mom for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll hug my mom for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how it's going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugs all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, dude, I appreciate that you wanted
to take some accountability and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I sounded pretentious, making it look
like I'm some sort of consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I like the accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for stepping up and saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, sorry that Irma has ripped your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, dude, thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to me and Subcool and
you're learning from the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are doing things correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing exactly what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your emails in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read one more email and this
is going to work us into the main topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff had a quick
question for you, but first wanted to let
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how great your podcast is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a lot of emails that start off like
that and every time it means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of effort into this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time, a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate every compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, or maybe she goes on to
say, you are incredibly knowledgeable and
[SPEAKER_00]: well-spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a goldmine for newbies like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I can help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email continues to say, my main
question is for someone like me who isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: in a legal state, what is my best bet on
getting high quality seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a lot of research and
wondering about going with US banks or an
[SPEAKER_00]: overseas one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes without saying that my main
concern is discreteness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you meant discretion, but hey,
we'll let you fly with quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: dependability coming in right behind any
info or suggestions on the subject or just
[SPEAKER_00]: tips for the beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help me out with would be greatly
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusting me, because I've got some info
for you that you're going to appreciate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, also, I just wanted to let you
know how I feel like we have become
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies just from the short month I've
been listening to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being pretty engulfed in standup comedy
myself, along with Rogan's, Joey Diaz's
[SPEAKER_00]: and other podcasts, and being a deadhead
myself, I feel like we are cut from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool that you say you feel
like we're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always felt that the podcasters I
have listened to for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually comedians, when I go see those
comedians, I feel like I've already
[SPEAKER_00]: developed some sort of a relationship with
them because I've been listening to Joey
[SPEAKER_00]: Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a listed Joey right here in the
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to Joey for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say probably five years solid,
maybe more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't remember when I
discovered Uncle Joey, but I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to Joey religiously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every podcast he goes on, I listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every episode he puts out, I go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any special he does, try to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time he comes to Denver,
I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm there in Denver, I've tweeted the
guy enough to where he recognizes my name,
[SPEAKER_00]: he recognizes my little Twitter icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know each other now, and we don't know
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just know each other because I listen
to him two days a week talk about whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy shit he did in the 80s, and then
when I see him, I tweet him enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: where he replies, and then when I see him,
it's like we know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, I appreciate that you think we're
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ever around in Colorado in my
neck of the woods, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bros now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a part of the podcast family,
and dude, to put me to say anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: my podcast and then include Rogan and Diaz
in the same email, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment, and then if
you're a deadhead bro, we are cut from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are family, so let's smoke a dab one of
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me answer your main question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main question is for someone like you
who isn't in a legal state, what is your
[SPEAKER_00]: best bet on getting high quality seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, of course, recommend the dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in America, so you don't have to
worry about any customs type shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this to keep myself out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy seeds from anywhere,
it is your responsibility to know the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have seeds and it is illegal to
grow them, be sure that you are only
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing them for the intention of
collecting and preserving those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's illegal in your state,
promise yourself that you will never grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only buying them to have them as a
collectible so that perhaps something goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down and there's Armageddon and there are
no more cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be the only one on the planet
that's got these seeds preserved,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll be like a historical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like a curator of fine quality
cannabis collectibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe one day your state will go
legal, and that's what you're waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so don't buy seeds with the
intention to grow them if you live in an
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dankteam.com will ship you seeds to be
used as collectibles if you live in
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal states.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a legal state, feel free to
grow them and see what comes out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be impressed and amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I've got to say,
I don't know what happens if you get seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped to you and you live in an illegal
state and that package gets intercepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot be responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to check with your own legal
counsel or somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out before you do it and don't
find out the hard way because honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what could happen to you or
the sender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that the dankteam.com is a
reliable vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of great brands and they
are in the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked about discretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will ship everything to you very
discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't even know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll blend in with the rest of the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, I can assure you, quality is top
notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry brands like Alphacronic,
Mile High, Canaventure, Sour Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: Irie Genetics, Rare Dankness, DNA
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of good stuff on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your next one is, what are you looking
for, quality and dependability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the people at thedankteam.com
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are friends of mine and they are
dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any info and suggestions, I recommend
thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out and let them know that
Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them you listened to the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it'll help you out,
but just let them know because it may help
[SPEAKER_00]: me out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you both for your emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a question,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about purchasing
seeds, I want to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations from a seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that if you have realistic
expectations when you buy seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be much less disappointed and
much happier with your purchase when the
[SPEAKER_00]: time comes to harvest your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, it takes about 120
days to grow a crop of cannabis from a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say 120 days, maybe 150 days
to grow a crop of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's four to six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: To grow this crop, you probably order the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you order from,
it's going to take a week or two to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're looking at four months plus two
more weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at 18 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably shopped on the seeds for a
week and thought what you were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another week you had to wait for a
paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at 20 full weeks from the
time you decide to purchase the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get to the time you
actually get to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make a lot of sense to do plenty
of research and invest investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: before you order your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of buying some seeds, throwing
them in the garden and then trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what you're going to do with
these plants that you don't know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most websites that sell seeds have very
good description of what you can expect
[SPEAKER_00]: from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are mostly accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are salespeople.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders want you to buy their seeds so
they will butter up the descriptions just
[SPEAKER_00]: like any other product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find a breeder that you trust
and then you have to find a seed line that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been out for a minute that's been
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody wants to grab the hot new
shit but sometimes it's better to wait a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit because sometimes when you grab
the hot new shit you find out that it
[SPEAKER_00]: really wasn't as hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more shit and then you've got a
bunch of that in your grow room and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone and spent a thousand dollars
on this one breeder and bought 10 packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: his shit and now you got a bunch of crap
in your grow because he released stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: without testing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put it out too early, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do some research before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a strain that gets your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're shopping for seeds there are
several things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want an indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of effects do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want it to be a mind racing thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want it to be a body thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this for medicinal uses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is somebody going to be smoking this
cannabis for a medical reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find a strain that works for
their medical condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they've been shopping around in
dispensaries, buying different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've done some research and
you know what kind of works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, a new smoker,
a new medical patient, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do some research on what types of
effects you want from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about if you want indica or
sativa or a hybrid or what type of effect
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for the mind, for the
body, think about stuff like that to
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need to think about
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a lot of height in your grow
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you grow real tall plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the space that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to buy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to buy seeds that will produce
plants that you're going to be able to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: into your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a short space you're not
going to want super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a really tall space you
might want to put some taller hazes,
[SPEAKER_00]: some longer flowering plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depends on how much space you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that when you're shopping for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get hazes and sativas if you've got
low ceilings, if you don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how much time you want these
crops to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how much time you can dedicate
to flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go buy, once again,
you don't want to buy a haze plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take you 10 to 12 weeks if you
don't have 10 to 12 weeks to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need product sooner, if you're a
cashcropper, you want something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to eight or nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing because you want that
head ripping sativa, you might want an 11
[SPEAKER_00]: or 12 weaker, but think about that before
you buy the seeds because once you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: them, there's no seed bank on the planet
that's going to take seeds back from
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have opened them up,
you could have spit on them, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have put other seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't take shit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sales are final with all seed
companies, so be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, think about yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need big yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a cashcropper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing for medicinal reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields may be really important to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a medical grower, yields are
important, but not as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for medicinal purposes,
you need to worry that that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, and we're going to get to that,
the specific strain has a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that works for the specific
patient's specific condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the beauties about growing
from seed is you can select that for your
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe yield matters to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield matters to everybody because you
have to pay for the electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to pay for the nutrients,
you have to pay for the dirt, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay for all of that, so hopefully you get
enough yield to make it worth your time
[SPEAKER_00]: and your energy and your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much work are these plants going to
take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like ... I'm trying to find some
strains that are ... Jillybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jillybean is really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jillybean, you put her in dirt,
you watch her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from TGA Subcool Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at TGA Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I could have used one of my own
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I used a Subcool Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jillybean, she's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need one stick in the middle just
to hold that top cola up if she gets real
[SPEAKER_00]: huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If she gets real big branches,
you may need a couple of sticks to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a stick on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a fuzzy tie or some plant tape or
something just to hold those sticks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds to the giant sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jillybean is really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like my Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bounty Killer gets really long arms and
grows really, really big, so she's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to need more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: She may need some trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to need more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get in there and put these plants
under a trellis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you handle putting a lot of stakes in
the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't be there a lot, if you're
just going to set up a hydro grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: leave and come back every now and then
when you need to, then something like
[SPEAKER_00]: Bounty Killer wouldn't be ideal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something more simple to grow,
something that you don't have to mess with
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie Wreck from Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a phenotype of Cookie Wreck that
you don't even have to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd water it once or twice and it just
fucking lives forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It loves to be bone dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thrives when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like that, something that
they say, hey, it likes dry, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description, that may be better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about how much work you're going
to need to put into the strain that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a short, stocky indica
that finishes in eight weeks, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a whole bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a tall, stretchy sativa that
takes 12 weeks, that's going to be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fucking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't grown a lot of
cannabis, do both of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow yourself an eight week indica and
then grow a 12 week sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small room and you
overcrowd yourself with that sativa and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've still got four more weeks to go,
you're looking at life going, fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, think about aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aromas and flavors, the descriptions of
the aromas and flavors are sometimes kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fantastical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look for reviews on the strains if
you're going by flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the breeders will definitely
inflate the descriptions when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll try to tell you that it tastes
like bubble gum coated in sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: coated in grape juice, rolled in pine
needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by then you're lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tongue doesn't even know what the
hell to think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep my descriptions fairly to
the point and really quick, but be careful
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's what you're shopping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, and this is a big part of what I'm
going to talk about, but read about the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes or do research on the seeds
that you're buying to see what types of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation come from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what types of phenotypes are known for
coming from those seeds and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers are for getting those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use Jilly Bean a lot when I talk
about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Miss Jill and Subcool
from TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Jilly Bean, I like to talk about
her when I talk about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three phenotypes that you
generally get from a pack of Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you pop 10 seeds, we'll see you get
five males and you got five females to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to have the candy
store pheno, the orange pheno,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the one that is just kind of in the
middle that's just basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the basic bitch pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that candy store and the orange pheno
are popular phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were going to buy some Jilly
Bean, you could go research what they look
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what they smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see pictures of both phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get very good descriptions of
both phenotypes through the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: through a little bit of searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go to web forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just search for the name of the strain
and then type pheno variations or
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes available or common phenotypes
and it'll start showing you and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll know what your chances are
of finding that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like buying baseball cards,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're all looking for that
fucking Mickey Mantle and sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to run seeds and you never
know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do some research, you know how
many Mickey Mantle cards are put through
[SPEAKER_00]: how many packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can at least think about if I buy a
10 pack of this strain, what are my
[SPEAKER_00]: chances of finding my keeper that I am the
phenotype that I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably narrow it down a little
by doing some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've decided what strain you
want to grow and who you're going to order
[SPEAKER_00]: from, there are several places to order
you guys, but I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not have everything you're
looking for, but they have got plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: good shit on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've decided what you're going to
order and where you're going to order it
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you need to decide if you want
regular or feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the strains available now come out
in regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shortly after that, they are
released by the same breeder in feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're not familiar with feminized
seeds, let me tell you what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow cannabis from regular seeds,
you have a chance of having male or female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in the cannabis garden,
if you're growing for buds, you only want
[SPEAKER_00]: the female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would remove the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't want to deal with
the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have devised a way to create plants,
to create seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will only create female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think they're
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can teach you how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you a brief lesson on how I do
it because that's not what this episode is
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quickly, here's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat it with the product that I make at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat the plant with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each strain needs a different treatment
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want to get hit real hard with
a heavy dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some want to be sprayed more frequently
with a lower dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the strain you have to
experiment with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will spray a female plant with silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That female plant will put out a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver disrupts the copper movement in
the plant, which creates an ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction in the plant, which triggers the
plant to produce male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those male flowers will produce pollen
that only contains female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since my plant is a female, there are no
male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen that comes out is female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that pollen onto a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have only used female genes,
so all of the progeny, the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did this correctly, they will all be
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm doing, so when I do this,
it happens correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no witchcraft to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tricking the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no genetically modifying anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just basic science from triggering
the plant by treating it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You disrupt one part of the plant to
trigger a desired response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've researched it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we make feminized seeds,
how I make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how modern feminized seeds are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you guys credit that say that
feminized seeds were all hermaphrodites
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a long time ago when the femseeds
started, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way they were doing that is just
turning on the lights during the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle when they should be asleep,
messing with the light cycle, messing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will definitely cause plants to throw
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds do not have female-only
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will have a tendency to have
intersex traits, which mean they will be
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female at the same time,
also known as a hermaphrodite,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as cut that shit down and get
it out of my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, yes, femseeds were made
with a little bit of shady, shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we understand what we're doing,
and feminized seeds are made with science,
[SPEAKER_00]: with research, and I believe in them and
trust in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow regular or feminized
seeds, that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are haters on feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they're not educated,
but also a lot of people are haters on
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds who are very educated
because they feel like people breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with feminized seeds will cause problems
down the line, and they feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds bottlenecks the progress
of cannabis, bottlenecks the evolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: bottlenecks our breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some folks feel that way, I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do take some responsibility by making
way more regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do feminized seeds, try to
counterbalance the damage that I do by
[SPEAKER_00]: making femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody thinks I'm causing any
problems, I just make way more regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to kind of offset that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a problem with femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really helpful for a person
who has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, you're allowed to grow
six plants legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up a grow wherever you want in
your house, as long as it's secure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you want to have all six of those
come to fruition, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So six feminized seeds would be the way to
go instead of throwing down six seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: having three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of them become boys, and now you got
to pull three of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only got three left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all this wasted space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought you'd had six.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where feminized seeds would come in
very handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've decided what strain you
want, and you've decided if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: regular or feminized seeds, that's when
you go ahead and make your order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the website of your choice,
thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the strains you want, then you make
your order, and then you patiently wait
[SPEAKER_00]: for those seeds to come in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an illegal state,
you put them in a safe, you put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: safe storage container, and you collect
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a state where it is legal to
grow cannabis, you germinate them and you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now I want to talk about
expectations of a seed pack, and I've kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of talked about selecting seed packs,
but I haven't really talked too much about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you should expect once you start
growing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me like a lot of people think
that every seed they plant is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people seem to think that if they
buy a 10-pack of whatever strain is hot
[SPEAKER_00]: today, that if they plant one of those
seeds, it's going to grow and look just
[SPEAKER_00]: like the one in the picture, just like the
one that whatever breeder posted on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website that you bought it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's gonna look just like that
if you plant one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's gonna taste just like the
one you bought from the dispensary that
[SPEAKER_00]: one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's gonna get you high just
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe you're gonna get super
fucking lucky, and it'll be that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but chances are it is not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a 10-pack of seeds,
and you plant 10 seeds, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seeds, you've got a 50-50 chance
of each of those seeds being a male or a
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine messaged me the other day
and said that he got some seeds from me
[SPEAKER_00]: that I gave him, and he told me every
single one of those seeds in that package
[SPEAKER_00]: was a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got a bunch of seeds, and now he has
zero shit growing because they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really rare that you get 100% males,
but it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also possible that you get all
females, but science says you got a 50-50
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of getting a male or a female from
each seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you pop 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypothetically, 50-50 chance happens,
five males came out, those got cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are pushed aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got five to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see anything acting funky early in
veg when it's still little, I get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's ugly, if it's not growing right,
if it's slow, if it's shitty, if it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem, I toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I wanna waste space and time and
nutrients, money, lights, air on something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not going to be what I'm looking
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's small and shitty, it's always
gonna be small and shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll replace it with something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's say you got five females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say one of them was just growing a
little janky.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got four to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does suck about seeds is there's
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is fucking awesome about seeds is
there is variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you want the one that looks like the
picture that the breeder posted up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's the one you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully you get the one that grows
perfectly for your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you get the one that smells just
like you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk by it, you go, damn,
that smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you find the one that gives you
the effects you are after.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a medical patient, hopefully one
of those four plants that's left is the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that when you smoke it,
all of your pain goes away or all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety goes away or you're able to dance
like Michael Jackson or whatever your goal
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you get to finish those four
phenotypes and you get to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was the magic phenotype
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cool part about growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to find the one that is perfect
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me throw in a piece of advice here
that is just kind of random, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you grow, whenever you get a new
plant, if it's a clone, if it's a seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever you grow a plant for the first
time, make sure you take a clone of it
[SPEAKER_00]: because that may be the most amazing herb
you've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have a clone,
if you don't have a copy of that to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you might be heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be some of the worst shit you
ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a plant years ago that I grew from
seed and I tried to take clones of it so
[SPEAKER_00]: many times and none of the goddamn clones
would root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't good at cloning back then,
but I took enough clones to where at least
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those clones should have taken root
and I should have that plant, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: just wouldn't root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked that weed and I was like,
this is amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it with my buddy Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it with Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pops said that that was one of the top
five best weeds he has ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that old man is picky and stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he said it was one of his top five,
it was damn good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved it and I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never get to smoke it again because I
couldn't get a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit shook
and broken up over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take clones of everything that you grow
if it's the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep one clone alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if you want to smoke that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to smoke it again,
throw those clones away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love it, keep that clone and you
can grow it over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn that clone into a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take clones off of it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get back to talking about the
variation and finding the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does suck that you have variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants, and it kind of depends on how
far the breeder took that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s you're going to find a lot of
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: F3, it's going to narrow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you're to the F4, F5,
you're going to come out with fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform plants, but you'll still find
variations in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you buy seeds, expect some
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you can plant one and it's
going to look just like the one on the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture or taste just like the one you
smoked at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're searching through those
phenotypes to find the one that works best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, that's a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: An experienced grower like myself loves a
good phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps it fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps it new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep an eye out for the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you're a kid and you used
to get a box of cereal and the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing you would do is go home and
dig your arm all the way into the cereal
[SPEAKER_00]: and get all sugary and just try to find
that prize and hope you got the cool prize
[SPEAKER_00]: that was on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what it's like when you
grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't wait to see what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you finish out those four and then you
get to smoke them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully everybody in the room
agrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often there will be some
disagreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody will be like, I really liked
number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody will be like,
man, number four is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then being the grower, you've got to
decide, do you want the one that harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: the best or tasted the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you have decisions to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep maybe, maybe the one that
harvested the best, keep that one around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that works the best medically
for you, keep that one around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you could grow the medical one
for your medical head stash and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the huge harvester just to have
backup buds for when you smoke all that
[SPEAKER_00]: good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can smoke them together and make
it stretch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best part is you get to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew that from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a custom strain now that nobody
else has got around you because you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: that phenotype and nobody else has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got something brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cashcropper, if you're a black
market grower, that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got the new, new shit that
nobody else has.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you buy seeds, keep in mind,
there's going to be a little work.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to grow all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to grow all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to grow all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nature happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A breeder can do so much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cannot guarantee you what's going
to come from a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird shit happens from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing shit happens from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I grow from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow something that nobody else
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find something that's way more
amazing than the last seed you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep growing more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I'm trying to say is
expect some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to grow the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a clone of that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull all of the males from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see them showing male,
pull those from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull any slow, or weird plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of those out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to finish out the phenotypes
that you keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim them, dry them, cure them,
smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have lab testing available,
lab test them if that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've talked in another episode that
lab testing isn't always the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what the lab test says?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like smoking phenotype A,
and the lab test says that phenotype B has
[SPEAKER_00]: more THC, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep number A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not growing for a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing for your medicinal needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worry more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But smoke it, finish it, get it lab
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab test it if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if that's what you smoke,
see what that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then choose the one that you really like
or choose the two that you really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make a limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to limit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have as many as you choose,
but pick the ones you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the ones that suck for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can redo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of narrow a 10 pack down to
two or three, and then grow those two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three again side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll narrow it down to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to think I'm going to narrow
it down to one, but I always get fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: stubborn and keep two around for a real
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I'll get tired of
growing one and I'll just, I get tired of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the whole strain, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just keep one of them around to
have it in my library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll grow more seeds and then
I'll find something better than one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, however many is in my stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I got about 20 female plants,
maybe a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll grow some seeds and I'll see what
I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I find one that really is better
than one of those 20 or however many
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants I've chosen to keep at
whatever facility I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one is better than I will just call
one, like whatever the weakest link is
[SPEAKER_00]: will get replaced by the new seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I'm so stubborn, what ends up
happening is I replaced that old one with
[SPEAKER_00]: two, like my two favorite new phenotypes
until I get bored of growing that new
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, until I start growing something
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just toss one of them and put
it in the, basically on the shelf for
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation with the rest of my mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will decide if I want to breed
to it or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start growing from seed,
you may find yourself kind of becoming a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant hoarder, just wanting to pop more
seeds, find that next phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you can pull out of a seed pack
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a very addicting hobby,
a passion, an art, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing from seed is a really fun thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing from seed way more than I
like growing from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like clones because I know what I'm
going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a future episode, we will do the clone
versus seed debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also do the regular versus
feminized debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got anything you'd like to
contribute to those debates, you can send
[SPEAKER_00]: me info, email me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com or tweet me
[SPEAKER_00]: at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your side of the
debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never know, maybe I'll use part of
your email in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's recap and start
wrapping up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short story is if you buy a pack of
seeds, grow that pack of seeds and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: expect to find the exact one that you saw
on the breeder's website, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant 10 seeds and they are regular
or feminized, I wouldn't expect all 10 of
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds to come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not harvest all 10 of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may need to get cold for
random reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, regular seeds or feminized seeds can
be hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get those out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just have weird, weak plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a plant that grows way too
tall, way too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one that won't grow at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of that shit so that you can have
strong, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to keep around something
that's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't expect all 10 of your seeds that
you plant to come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are growing that first round to find
the phenotype that works for you or your
[SPEAKER_00]: patient or your style or your needs or
reaches your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first grow with a seed pack is not
meant to be really a production grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have usable material,
have usable product, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: production run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to find the keeper, then that's
the one that you want to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: production runs with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to dial that one in,
learn how much nutrients she wants,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how much humidity she likes,
learn how long you need to let her go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe she needs eight, maybe nine,
maybe 10, maybe 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get her dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first run is just to find that
phenotype that you're looking for.
