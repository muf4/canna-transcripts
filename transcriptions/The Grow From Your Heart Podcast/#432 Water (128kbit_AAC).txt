[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 432 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Miracle
Alien Cookies, Full Spectrum Extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got the Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is alien cookies crossed to Colombian
Starfighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label describes the flavor as jelly
biscuits and lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do taste the lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I tasted the jelly
biscuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a creative description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go right along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this contains seventy three
point eight eight percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not be the most potent
concentrate on my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is the container that I keep
reaching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Mac is delicious and the buzz from
this Mac is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been loving this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious and tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: Miracle Alien Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really loving this extract and I
cannot get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to read a
couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's give a shout
out to a few of our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with a big shout out to my
friend Miss Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kenna You Dig It.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to Hogan
Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big Viking Handshake to
Grimbold the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast fist bump and a shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: new friend Trap Jackson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out and big thanks to everybody
who has supported the show and the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the present and in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would like to learn how to
become a patron, you can do so by going to
[SPEAKER_00]: www.patreon.com slash Grow From Your
Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more order of business to
cover before we can get into the listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I did mention that my
seeds will be available on SeedsHereNow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case you're not familiar,
I am the breeder and proprietor of
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make high THC, Sativa dominant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brand is mostly known for my cross
called Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has gotten very popular lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got very impressive lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the previous episode, I mentioned that
my seeds would be available at
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of this recording,
the website has not been updated to
[SPEAKER_00]: include my seeds, but it is in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a very busy holiday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are still in the process of
building my brand onto the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be patient, keep checking back
and I will soon be available on
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are eager to get some iRegenetics
seeds in your garden and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for seeds here now to get the website
updated, you can go to dankseed.store or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go to organeliteseeds.com and they
do have a great selection of iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds available at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I do want to apologize for
misleading you, for making you think my
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds may be available somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not actually available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks at SeedsHereNow are working on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are doing a lot of updates and
upgrades to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be very well worth the wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be patient, bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in due time, my seeds will be
available on SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers all of the business
for the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to send an email to the
show, my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a cannabis culture,
a cannabis cultivation question,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into this first message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Jeff, first I want to thank
you for the Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I found your podcast
shortly after starting my first Grow late
[SPEAKER_00]: last year and the Grow Lessons helped me
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm helping you out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I appreciate all of the
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to White Mike, but your Grow
Lessons in particular are a treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually listen to them two or three
times to give my stoner brain a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to absorb all of the knowledge that
you drop on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the non Grow info is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I have the urge to show off my
Grow or just a picture of my Grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a little White Mike voice in my ear
that says, just shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grow Lessons were invaluable to this
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he learned a very important
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: From myself and White Mike, he learned to
just shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't heard that lesson,
it is episode 406.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is titled, Another Important Lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about keeping your mouth shut
when it comes to your cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy has learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue on with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, So I have a few questions about
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: For reference, I've got a small indoor
grow tent with three auto flower plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number one, my local water is
pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves a white residue on anything it
touches and it has a strong chlorine
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that that white
residue is calcium and will assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: that strong chlorine smell is chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says right out of the tap, I am reading
eight to eight point four pH and about
[SPEAKER_00]: four hundred and fifty PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy is doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's testing his water before he uses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are finding that the pH is quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That four hundred and fifty PPMs is kind
of high, but that is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of what you get from city
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is I would go to my city
water website, wherever your local
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal water comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a website, whoever you are
paying, whoever you send your money to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a website and somewhere on
that website, there will be a breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things they're adding to your
municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to see exactly what is
going into that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things they use to treat water
can't be filtered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things they use to treat the
water can't be bubbled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get more into that as this
message progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, I've recently started using an
inline RV style water filter to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorine verified to be chloramine and the
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those things I mentioned that
they may be treating your water with is
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramine and we cannot bubble chloramine
out of the water to effectively remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a reverse osmosis or a carbon
filtration system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will not be able to bubble out the
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly doubt that your RV style
water filter will be efficient enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull out the chloramine from your water
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I fill my water container and I
let the water come to room temperature for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12 hours because I was told that
cold water will shock the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water is too cold, it will shock
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will send the plants into shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't drink properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will respond accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I stuck your feet or your balls
in really cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what it is like when you feed the
plants really cold water, except you can
[SPEAKER_00]: lift your feet up out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have no chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stuck in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just sitting there freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feed your plants water that is
too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say somewhere between 69 and 74
degrees is probably about the right range
[SPEAKER_00]: for your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a recirculating system or
some sort of a hydroponic system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may want to go a little cooler because
those warm temperatures will increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for algae and funk to build up
in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a hydro grower, so I'm not an
expert in that region, but I know they do
[SPEAKER_00]: use a chiller in a hydro environment to
keep that water a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a soilless mix or a cocoa
or something like that, you do want that
[SPEAKER_00]: water to be about room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing the right thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to shock your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're letting that water come to room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that time, I am also running an air
stone to add more dissolved oxygen and to
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially bubble out any leftover
chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you get rid of the
chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also help you get rid of some of
the other elements that they use to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're doing there is you are
creating more surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff can evaporate until it is
brought to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're adding oxygen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're elevating it to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets it become a gas, helps it to
evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will remove some of the things in
your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, it will not
remove the chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need an RO filter for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with the email because
those dabs got me rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do this before adding any
nutrients and of course, getting it all to
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe any of this to be
necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not necessary, how about beneficial?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the chlorine, calcium or whatever else
is in my tap water hindering my plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way or am I taking extra steps for no
real benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really simple and really important
answer to this question is how are the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants reacting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants telling you that there is a
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what is happening in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what is happening in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what is happening in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the plants are showing
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are showing you some type of
distress, if the plants are displaying
[SPEAKER_00]: slowed or stagnant growth, then you
possibly have a potential problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants look happy and they are
performing at a level you expect or a
[SPEAKER_00]: level that keeps you happy, then there is
probably not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say there's probably not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something to be improved
upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the plants are performing and
they're not showing any yellowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're not wilting, if leaves aren't
falling off, if there are no burnt tips,
[SPEAKER_00]: if nothing looks wrong, then there's
probably nothing really wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will let you know when they're
not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cannabis plants love to let us know
when there is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very many ways to indicate that
something is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start giving us flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will either droop and claw or
the leaves will taco and fold up or the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves will go pale or the leaves will
start getting burnt tips or they'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow stripes up the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants really give us tons of signs
and very many hints as to what is going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plants aren't showing you that
they are angry, they are probably mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, there is always some
sort of room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something we are
overlooking because we don't speak plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they aren't showing you that they
are angry, they are probably not angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are the first thing,
the first indicator, the main thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about all the fancy
monitors and all the cool equipment that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using these days and we're getting far
further and further away from paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the number one indicator of what's
going on in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you if they're angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you if they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you if they're dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you if they're wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you what's going on to pay
attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the human aspect of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting your time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any benefit to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are adding oxygen to the water,
which is going into your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more oxygen in the water, the better
the plants will love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow more vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root zone will be happier because of
that oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you are minimizing some of the
things that were put in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the chlorine and other things
that were put in that water for treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: will evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chloramine, however, will not be
removed through your air bubble method
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are doing work because you are
minimizing the overall amount of additives
[SPEAKER_00]: in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not a total waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you need to let the water sit to
come to room temperature anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's sitting to get to room
temperature, why not bubble it up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to add oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to remove some of those
chemicals that were put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it shows that you care about the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just doing something extra for the
plants to make sure that they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is always good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a good exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving you a bond with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like playing fetch with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really throw a ball for the
plant to go get, but you can give it some
[SPEAKER_00]: extra love by treating its water extra
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're showing some love for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing that you're dedicated to
the garden and that you want the best for
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be one extra detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be one extra step, but you're going
to notice it in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be proud of what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be because of this extra step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do it if it is not adding extra time to
your regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's slowing you down and it's not
necessary, that is when you need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about removing steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not seem like a waste of time at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were running a larger grow and you
had more plants, I would recommend moving
[SPEAKER_00]: to a larger filter, possibly a reverse
osmosis filtering system to clean all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff out of your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're in such a small grow,
I may upgrade to what is called a big boy
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is, are your plants
happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants look happy with what you're
doing, don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filtration will cost you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're growing for medical
purposes for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're making any income
off of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't making any income off of the
product, it is hard to put money into the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand that buying an expensive
filter may not be an option right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when throwing a bubbler in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as those plants are happy,
keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend checking that
water about once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the first of the month,
throw your EC meter or your PPM meter in
[SPEAKER_00]: that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw your pH pen in that water and just
document if it has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the pH gone up or down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the PPM's gone up or down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see a drastic change,
maybe go to that website and look and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what they've done differently because you
will see it change seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people do outdoor watery things in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use less water in the winter,
so the water is treated differently per
[SPEAKER_00]: season, per area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check on that
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are one of those people who
knows that when you mix up your nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: that solution has come to this point and
now I need to add about four drops of pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down and I'm right where I need to be,
your water that you started with may have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be time for you just to check,
just for peace of mind, just put your PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: meter in there, put your pH meter in there
and actually see if it is what you thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was because over time, like I said,
your local water supply will change the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals which they use to treat your
municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have gotten accustomed to
putting four drops of pH down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be anywhere near where you
think you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you've got your pH dialed in
right where you want it and your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are not feeding properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing plant problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll try to correct those problems by
adding CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll try to correct that problem by
adding something else or taking something
[SPEAKER_00]: else out when the whole problem was that
your pH was off because you were not
[SPEAKER_00]: checking your pH because you thought it
was a certain thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes a couple of seconds to stick
a pH pin in a solution and wait for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: come to 6.2 and show you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little check mark pops up,
6.2, I'm good, let's go water some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes a couple of seconds and if
it's off, it only takes a couple of more
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds to add some pH up or pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drop it in there, swirl it around,
give the water a couple of seconds to stir
[SPEAKER_00]: up and stick your meter back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's wrong, keep adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're adjusting your pH,
I suggest you go very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a funny joke in the grow world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH up or down solution doesn't work
until you have used too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put in one drop, you won't see a
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put in two drops, you won't see a
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put in three drops, it will change
drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go really slowly when adjusting your pH
if you're using a liquid pH up or down
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, especially in a larger container
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take a minute for all of that
stuff to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure it all stirs in so that your
pH adjustment solution isn't just in one
[SPEAKER_00]: big puddle in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it all gets saturated into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Emulsify it, I think is the word I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's all emulsified and all
stirred up real well so that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have just one big pocket of pH solution
here where the pH is really awkward in one
[SPEAKER_00]: spot and the rest of the water is a
totally different pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get it stirred up if you've
got a large vat of water is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to touch on while
I'm talking about mixing up water and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting pH is if you are using a liquid
pH adjusting solution like a pH up or pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down and you use too much and you have
gone past your desired pH range,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not suggest using the opposite
product to correct your adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you were trying to get to 6.2
and you added too much pH down and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: now at 5.9, I would not add pH up to
correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH up and pH down products are not
meant to be combined and the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction could wreak havoc on your
nutrient solution depending on what was
[SPEAKER_00]: used to create those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what brands you're buying,
I don't know what you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is a potential to destroy your
nutrient mix by adding both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do use too much of a pH up or
down liquid adjustment solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend using the opposite
product to correct the mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things you can do to
correct the pH once you've added too much
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pH adjustment product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pH has gone too low and the natural
pH of the water coming in from the tap is
[SPEAKER_00]: higher, you can just add higher pH water
and it will slowly raise the pH of your
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now adding water to your already mixed
solution is going to reduce the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs depending on how much water you need
to add that may or may not make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference to your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just depends on how far you have gone
off of your desired range and also how big
[SPEAKER_00]: your starting amount of water is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small home grow, you may be able to
just dump your water and start over if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with a gallon or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine working in a commercial
environment where my reservoirs range from
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 to 500 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I messed up 500 gallons of
water and had to dump that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is heartbreaking to waste that much
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have fed the grow one time with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine a village could survive off of 500
gallons of water for a long time depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on the amount of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste 500 gallons of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I adjust the pH and it's too low,
I'm probably going to add water and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just going to feed and we're going
to have a little bit reduced PPMs for that
[SPEAKER_00]: one feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in a commercial environment,
I'm feeding at least once, maybe twice,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one reduced feeding is not going to
have a big effect in the overall scheme of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small batch, a small
amount of water and you're comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with dumping it and starting over,
that is something you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we can do to adjust the pH
of our solution without adding another pH
[SPEAKER_00]: up or down product is to add a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've gotten your pH too high,
something like a kelp product or a humic
[SPEAKER_00]: product will definitely help lower the pH
of your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more very important thing to talk
about while we're discussing pH is the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of your solution will affect
your pH drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water is too cold, your pH will not
register correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water is too warm, the pH will not
register correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, let that water get to room
temperature before you measure and adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH of your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I did a full episode
called The Importance of Proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn a lot about pH,
about how pH is measured and why pH
[SPEAKER_00]: matters, I highly suggest you check out
episode 347 of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode will give you a lot of
information and a lot of education on the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of your proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there is a part two of this
question and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does flushing with distilled water have
any benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not supposed to drink distilled
water regularly because it flushes
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals from your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would it do the same to your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap up the message by saying,
thanks again for all of the info you
[SPEAKER_00]: provide and for supporting the community
like you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very, very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap it up with your friend in
prohibition land who cannot wait to wear
[SPEAKER_00]: his glitter suspenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's answer part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it necessary or beneficial to
flush our plants with distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point of flushing at this point
is to rinse out the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a soilless mix,
if you're using cocoa, if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're using, whatever that soil
root mass is living inside of,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to rinse that out so there aren't
leftover nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been feeding the plants nutrients
for several weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of want to rinse out that root
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of want to rinse out the dirt so
that the plant will begin to starve and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannibalize itself is essentially what we
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're trying to rinse out are 16
essential minerals that the plant live off
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to list all 16 because I
want your brain to do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking and maybe you'll do a little bit
of research, but we'll start with calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, phosphorus, potassium,
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are five to think about right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are five things we're feeding our
plants, five things we've put in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: five things that we kind of want to rinse
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not in regular water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feeding water to the plants at the end,
you're not adding anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using distilled water would not have
any advantage or any benefit since there
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
calcium, magnesium, molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there will be calcium in there because
we talked about that calcium that was
[SPEAKER_00]: visible earlier, but there won't be enough
to make a difference in the final outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: and the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are correct in thinking that humans
should not drink too much distilled water
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will flush the minerals from
our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't find it necessary for flushing
our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goal there is to rinse out the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants do the rest of what we
call the flushing process through their
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism, through their exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk a lot more about
flushing our plants in the very near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a lot of reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have read some informative yet
controversial things on the topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also said some controversial things
when it comes to flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do more reading and I'm going
to get a solid understanding of what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I bring it to a public forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, I don't find any reason
to flush our plants with distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would become expensive and
probably a bit of a pain in the ass to
[SPEAKER_00]: haul around enough water to effectively
flush your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you live in a non-legal state,
that is another indicator and another sign
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may be doing something out of the
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that is popping up in the
back of my head while I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, I use RO water in many grow
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse osmosis water in many ways is very
similar to distilled water in many ways is
[SPEAKER_00]: also different than distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't see much of a difference in
the flush when I use the RO water compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to when I use just regular tap water or
just water ran through the big boy filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't notice any difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast ruled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that wraps up this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank our friend once again for
sending this message from Prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I cannot wait until you get to wear
your glitter.
