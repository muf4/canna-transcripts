contest going on, anything like that,
[SPEAKER_14]: that's all expired, doesn't count anymore,
don't get too excited.

[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let me keep this file nice and
short.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladies and gentlemen, here's 49,
50, and 51 of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_14]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, what's up, cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to episode number 49.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I apologize in advance.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can already tell that my voice sounds
all terrible because I've got a cold,
[SPEAKER_14]: but as a professional podcaster,
this show must go on.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to skip that long intro that
I do, and we're just going to introduce
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody that's here.
[SPEAKER_14]: To my left, we got Adam.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yo, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_14]: To the left of him is White Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: And over here is everybody's favorite,
it's Jesse.
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_14]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming, you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for having us back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: These guys actually messaged me today and
they were like podcast around 730.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a long Christmas season.
[SPEAKER_14]: About 830-ish, they all showed up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're here to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, man, yeah, I want to apologize.
[SPEAKER_14]: I could tell that I'm going to sound
stuffy.
[SPEAKER_14]: There may be a pause or two in this
episode for me to take care of this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a broken pipe in my brain somewhere
and my nose faucet is just dripping,
[SPEAKER_14]: dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what I did.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not real professional stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize in advance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Need some plumber's crack.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, wait, no plumber's crack in my
face.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some plumber's putty or tape or some shit,
but no plumber's crack in my face.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_11]: How about plumber's on crack?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, as long as I can get here on time
and get my nose fixed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been drinking lots of good hydrating
liquids and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I should be cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Coconut Water.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's been helping me out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do owe a big shout out to Coot and Cat
from the Mystic Roots Band for letting me
[SPEAKER_14]: play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, can we talk about the project D-Boy's
been working on?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we allowed to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: These guys showed up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: They look beat, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of them look like they have just been
through the freaking wringer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I run them pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a long couple of weeks,
but a good couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so Jesse is apparently the boss.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a long story.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a full-blown consultant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me tell you what, I'll do anything you
need to get your place going.
[SPEAKER_12]: Including accidentally start a
construction company.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he'll build your grow out and then
he'll supply it with grow supplies and
[SPEAKER_14]: then him and I will teach you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we've got a grow team on hand if
you need employees.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll sell you genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can hook you up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Start to finish, folks.
[SPEAKER_11]: With oil producers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we do have quite a team here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you guys have been saying that Adam is
fucking found his niche.
[SPEAKER_14]: We found his wheelhouse finally.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been hunting for a while now and we
for sure found it.
[SPEAKER_14]: How long have you been here now,
bro?
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be a year in February.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be a year in February.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, you fill in pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm happy here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado has changed me for the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be a hermit and stuff like that
and just getting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all felt it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he asked me like, let's go and I'm
like, yeah, I'm in you know, the other
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasts were great, but you just,
you felt it in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were like, I miss my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun doing those week,
those holiday shows without you guys were
[SPEAKER_14]: cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to ramble and you know what?
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt an evolution in myself because if
my voice changed, I honestly just stuck a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot of toilet paper in my nose to keep my
nose from freaking running because it's
[SPEAKER_14]: dripping and it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if I sound weird, that's why.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not puberty issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not me cracking.
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt the evolution.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because those earlier shows, when it was
me on the mic by myself, it felt like I
[SPEAKER_14]: was reading like, this podcast is brought
to you by nature's green remedies.com is
[SPEAKER_14]: what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last couple episodes, I flipped
the papers over that I had on the desk and
[SPEAKER_14]: just started talking.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, yeah, fuck all the notes.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun to kind of put- It was way more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was good, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't too much at the beginning know
how to put, nobody cared about me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't want to come out and be like,
this is me and my podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: But now I feel like I've made friends with
all my listeners.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, they do kind of care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interacting, so.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're saying that Adam's found his
wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: This kid's a framer.
[SPEAKER_14]: He swings a hammer and frames like a
champ.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_14]: Who would have known?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done it for a while, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've had opportunities offered to
me like, let's go start a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, dude, you don't- I have
problems, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this table, a lot of these people
kind of understand those problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's that stoner kind of
mentality where, you know- Do you not play
[SPEAKER_02]: well with others on some of these?
[SPEAKER_02]: I may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But who doesn't?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a job site.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fucking- It's not an office,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you go off and cool off for 20
minutes and come back.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's always one guy at work every day.
[SPEAKER_14]: That one person has a problem and that one
guy has got a stick up his ass and it
[SPEAKER_14]: seems to rotate.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just how job sites are.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing construction in unheated,
sometimes poorly or unlit warehouses.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, tempers can flare quickly,
but we've got the team pretty chilled out
[SPEAKER_12]: and like, okay, go take a 20.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chill yourself out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Break is pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've learned to swing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_12]: No tools go flying at each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: Regularly anymore.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that's part of the reason why I don't
do construction.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather just be a lone wolf growing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I kind of- Sometimes I'm like,
man, these guys are having fun all day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to go to work somewhere with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'm like, eh, or I could just-
Maybe one day, but as you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: as for me, I got to get some money set up
before I can lone wolf grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Tuesday night as we record.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually have another meeting tomorrow
in the morning at the spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, things are starting to definitely come
together.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was in there checking out the grow a few
days ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a mess.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're getting a lot of shit done.
[SPEAKER_14]: The floors, the walls, and the ceiling are
all the same material and it looks like
[SPEAKER_14]: one sheet of everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't find the seams in this material
and these rooms are bigger than my house.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, how the fuck did they do this,
dude?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, when they get those finished,
I'll be growing in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm going tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're actually talking about sending me
to- There's a company that built our grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're talking about sending me to their
flagship grow so that I can go check it
[SPEAKER_14]: out and see what happens and learn from
their grow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be neat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a cannabis grow?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's by- I don't want to say the
wrong name.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I was told that I was wrong about who
made that.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a company that made it and then
another guy kind of- He was part of that
[SPEAKER_14]: company.
[SPEAKER_14]: He separated from them and improved on it
and sold them the improved ideas.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quickly- Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seeing it get built is also a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not lights or anything like that,
but just preparation for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they going to hire a grow specific
company to come in there and do that or
[SPEAKER_14]: are you guys doing it all the way to the
end?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do it with advice from- I
have reps phone numbers in my- There you
[SPEAKER_14]: go.
[SPEAKER_14]: HVAC guys, electricians.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're having a HVAC company come in
and put in specific units that are
[SPEAKER_11]: specifically set up.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're building a personal grow,
get a real electrician.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just have them inspect everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's so many electricians on Craigslist
and shit that are legit.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to snitch on you for
growing herb if you're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get an electrician.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't be that asshole that burned down
your house by trying to grow too many
[SPEAKER_14]: lights in one room.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a story in the paper today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some idiot Bruin Hooch blew his house up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I saw the photo in an explosion in
Pueblo County and I went, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_12]: please fuck no, fuck no, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got down to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not- I don't want to give them the idea,
but I strongly suspect they were making
[SPEAKER_14]: BHO in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see how alcohol would have- No,
that was a big thing during prohibition
[SPEAKER_12]: with this, why you can't make hard alcohol
in your own home.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do people still do that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a couple of guys from where I'm
from, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: They do it up in the woods like you're
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not doing it in an apartment.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So don't be that asshole to blow some shit
up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, if you're making- I've got a news
article that we're actually going to read
[SPEAKER_14]: a little later about making BHO.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to do an ad really quickly just
because we've got to sneak these in.

[SPEAKER_11]: We got a Grokashi in two days ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen more Grokashi in the past few
days than I have.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard it on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I still didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I'll go pick up a bag.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to go to Hygro for a couple of
things in the near future.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I'll pick up a bag.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll talk about it on the show a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of Grokashi, I'm going to branch
off here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw a box of prizes being donated to the
show from Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_14]: There might be some Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_14]: There might be some OGT.
[SPEAKER_14]: OGT is not going to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to jack that out of there.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually a bag of Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some OGT and there are some other
nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some really cool things in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some grab bag or swag bags.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Our good friend Task Rock sent us a highly
educated t-shirt in size large.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a couple of few Eyrie Genetics
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a couple of hat pins in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an Eyrie sticker pack.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Spence from the Garden of Weeden may
possibly have some prizes for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a couple of Garden of
Weeden stickers because I've got those.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping to get a shirt from him,
but the man is busy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So guys, check out episode 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping to have all three of these guys
back, plus Matty and Spence, which means
[SPEAKER_14]: it's going to be crowded as I'm looking at
the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a busy time, but we'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll figure it out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got more chairs over there and we'll
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll stand up the whole time and act like
a game show host or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not a whole lot to talk about in
this episode, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt like crap today.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't prepare and I just wanted to have
these guys over.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to kind of bullshit and read a
news article.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I do that, I got to say shout out
to treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_14]: This episode is brought to you in part by
treethugger.com live music lifestyle
[SPEAKER_14]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_14]: www.treethugger.com.

interested in sponsoring the show,
[SPEAKER_14]: send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I'll
[SPEAKER_14]: get you all the info that you need about
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's all the show opening
important part I'm supposed to make sure I
[SPEAKER_14]: cover.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys want to read a weird news
article?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's four men sitting at this table and
I'm about to say the word vagina a whole
[SPEAKER_14]: bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_14]: This article is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's cool about The Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_14]: When I open up The Cannabis website right
on the top, there is an advertisement for
[SPEAKER_14]: The Spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Southern Colorado's largest dispensary,
no long waits, friendly bud tenders and
[SPEAKER_14]: new strains weekly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Visit us today at The Spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Spot did not pay for that ad,
but I endorsed The Spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, there's a cute little bud tender
with dreadlocks over there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go visit her.
[SPEAKER_14]: Say what's up.
[SPEAKER_14]: She'll sell you some dank herbs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go visit The Spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: So The Cannabis, this article is by
Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_14]: The headline is that weed infused sex lube
for ladies.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be on Colorado shelves this month.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody in the room just looked at me
like, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw that this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was just some satire.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, this is a product that's gotten a lot
of press over the last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been in Cali for a while.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it has.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's the same product.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it says, remember when we first wrote
about THC infused sex lube, Floria,
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's quite singular user instructions
in June, 2014?
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_14]: It says apply four to eight sprays
directly on to the clitoris, inner and
[SPEAKER_14]: outer labia, and inside the vagina.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always like counting the number of
sprays in the middle of sex.
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't they used to do the same thing with
Lysol?
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually said quite singular user
instructions.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not during sex.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is by yourself.
[SPEAKER_14]: This chick's sitting on the couch or
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: You do four and wait and see if you feel
anything and then do three or four more
[SPEAKER_14]: later.
[SPEAKER_12]: What if it hit you like a truck?
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a mucus membrane.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all a mucus membrane.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to happen quickly.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be in a minute.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds horrible.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm all for the product.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, the number of pumps thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's ours.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is it always like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're so easy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to continue with the article
before it goes on a porn rant.
[SPEAKER_14]: That interview with Los Angeles-based
Foria founder, Matthew Gerson,
[SPEAKER_14]: helps introduce the unique product to the
masses.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now Gerson, who originally hails from
Boulder, is debuting his special
[SPEAKER_14]: non-psychoactive lube outside of
California for the very first time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Floria will make its Colorado debut at the
Native Roots location in Aspen during the
[SPEAKER_14]: Winter X Games on January 21st through
25th.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's confusing.
[SPEAKER_14]: What are they targeting?
[SPEAKER_12]: You're debuting your THC infused sex lube
at the X Games.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I'm high, but I totally just heard
all those words in the correct order.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I want to cross the line
of words I want to say on this show right
[SPEAKER_14]: now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your pussy got all beat up at the X Games.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's some lube to make it freaking feel
a little better.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the article says, I came out to LA from
Colorado and I've been trying to get back
[SPEAKER_14]: ever since.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gerson told the Cannabis, I'm super
excited to be bringing it to Colorado and
[SPEAKER_14]: Native Roots is a good alignment for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it'll be available at Native Roots.
[SPEAKER_14]: Need a reminder on what Floria is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Per Gerson from my June interview with
him, it's a sensual enhancement oil
[SPEAKER_14]: designed for female pleasure, a
therapeutic aphrodisiac.
[SPEAKER_14]: Women have described it as relaxing and
they've said it's heightened their
[SPEAKER_14]: sensations.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've associated it with warming and
tingling localized in the sexual region.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's where you're spraying it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to feel it on your arm.
[SPEAKER_14]: Floria will be on sale at Native Roots.
[SPEAKER_14]: Native Roots' new Aspen location at 308
South Hunter Street throughout the X Games
[SPEAKER_14]: and all other Native Roots locations after
the big event.
[SPEAKER_14]: Native Roots is Floria's partner in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: And how have the last six months been for
Floria in California?
[SPEAKER_14]: He says, we never could have imagined the
impact it's having on the patient
[SPEAKER_14]: community in California and how it's
spanned the spectrum of users from younger
[SPEAKER_14]: women who are looking to deepen the level
of intimacy of their own bodies to older
[SPEAKER_14]: women who are experiencing a reawakening
of their own sexuality, Gerson said.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a large number of women who
could benefit from cannabis, but who
[SPEAKER_14]: aren't interested in the psychoactive
component.
[SPEAKER_14]: The product's expansion into Colorado is
only the beginning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gerson estimates Floria will be available
in Washington state pot stores in the next
[SPEAKER_14]: few months.
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody else want to get this for a
chick they hate and be like, I got you
[SPEAKER_03]: this great perfume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'd be funny to get you a bottle.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you take a big dab and start
crying, I can help you that to spray.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would spray the roast beef sandwich
down, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a guy that claims he made a lube
using coconut oil and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he says when he uses it on chicks that
they definitely enjoy it a lot more than
[SPEAKER_14]: when he doesn't use it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to, I thought it'd be fun to
read this with four dudes at the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also like cannabis a lot more when I use
it prior than when I don't use it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The article was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just fucking little puns and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a lot of placebo warnings about
this, you know, where as in it's- I paid
[SPEAKER_03]: $80 for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Something better, Tingle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if she's going to, if she's spraying
it on her clit and entering out her labia,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's working.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's already moisten and shit up and
that's waking it up a little.
[SPEAKER_14]: So even if it doesn't work, but have you
ever eaten like tincture or, I guess it's
[SPEAKER_14]: just tincture that does it, but you get
warm inside.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you feel warm and fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can just imagine spending some tincture
on my junk though, letting it get all
[SPEAKER_14]: sticky and gross.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I felt that night from that
mountain bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the whole feeling that I
really got.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you rub the mountain bar on your junk?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try that next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be $12 well spent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you how much right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I refrained myself from using taint
earlier.
[SPEAKER_14]: The show just got really, really weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done ruin that for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know a product that definitely does
work.
[SPEAKER_14]: That apothecana pain relief cream.
[SPEAKER_14]: Extra strength.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, with the juniper arnica cannabis
stuff, dude, I didn't believe in it to
[SPEAKER_14]: tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Topicals definitely worked.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was skeptical about it because I'm a
pothead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you got to smoke weed or consume
cannabis somehow to get high, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: But my girlfriend, actually the Grammy
Gatsby gave me a bottle of that apothecana
[SPEAKER_14]: and I rubbed my girlfriend down with it
for like an hour and a half one night.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my, to quote Pink Floyd, my hands felt
just like two balloons.
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt like I had Mickey Mouse gloves on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, my hands are big.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they felt all like fluffy and bigger
than they were.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a dream or something?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I'd go to like scratch my face and
punch myself in the head a little bit
[SPEAKER_14]: because my fingers were there already.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_14]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like I had boxing gloves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom used that and she said she got high
as shit from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I don't know about getting high as
shit from it, but I definitely felt- My
[SPEAKER_02]: mom's a very small smoker though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe she did.
[SPEAKER_14]: It definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_14]: I start off the massage with just coconut
oil to kind of start a massage and get her
[SPEAKER_14]: loosened up and get her lubed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried to avoid the word lube.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if I use that apothecana right
away, it absorbs in too quickly and I
[SPEAKER_14]: don't think it spreads enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I get her coconut oiled and then I put
the apothecana in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell that she can, I can see that
she loosens up as soon as that apothecana
[SPEAKER_14]: starts getting in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I had to use that word.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just nothing else to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He knew.
[SPEAKER_14]: He gets it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't want to use lube, but- I didn't
want to use the word lube, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_14]: you got to take that job and say words
that you're trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people don't like the word moist.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Moist.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like really- It's the way some people say
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Moist.
[SPEAKER_11]: Moist like a properly- Like you've been
using that spray.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you've been using that cannabis spray
maybe.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to try to put this show back
on track.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's another article from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so fucking lost.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't even talk.
[SPEAKER_14]: I still got this Kleenex in my nose too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Face stamp on.
[SPEAKER_14]: This article is written by John Engel and
Jordan Stefan from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_14]: The headline is, cash oil legality now
questioned for Colorado courts.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the sub headline is by the end of
Wednesday hearing, Denver district court
[SPEAKER_14]: judge, A.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bruce Jones had concluded both sides were
wrong, though it was still unclear how he
[SPEAKER_14]: would ultimately rule.
[SPEAKER_14]: Side note, this dude's name is A.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bruce Jones.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring a bad motherfucker if your first
name is just an initial.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is actually a type of graphical error
led me being called D for like two and a
[SPEAKER_12]: half years during public school.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_14]: This dude chose to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's A.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bruce Jones.
[SPEAKER_12]: He chose to do it or his parents just
tagged it to him.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess if I wanted to be a poet or
something, my middle name is Scott.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd be J.
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then my last name, I almost said it on
the show, but I ain't going to do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it'd be J.
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott Rasta.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you wanted to go that way, you don't
have to change your name to become a poet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that really sophisticated?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what he's trying to do?
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is his first name just like 17 letters
and starts with A?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their little nickname for me at work and
shit is what I used to get teased as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as like five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, that's what used to hurt,
you know, like when you're a kid and the
[SPEAKER_03]: kids find that one thing, you know,
like, go at it forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I mean, I'm, I'm an adult now,
so it's, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, there's those times where
it's both of them sitting in the corner.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen you're trying to remember what
year the Joe Dirk was released.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was when you were five.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was actually shot from afar.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just followed me around for years.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if Joe Dirt, and if you guys,
I don't know if you guys watch King of the
[SPEAKER_14]: Hill, but if Lucky from King of the Hill
and Joe Dirt had a kid, it would be Adam.
[SPEAKER_14]: And his name would be 44.
[SPEAKER_11]: 44, dear day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been calling him Joe Dirt lately for
a whole nother reason.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a handy little motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to tell the story about what
you did with your shatter the other day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me, anybody out there that's a
little inexperienced, I'm from the South.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've not been dabbing that long,
but so I took shatter to work and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, it's all cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, we got in the car and I'm sitting
there and I'm like, let's, let's do a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, you know, yeah, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try and it's shattering everywhere
and I'm spilling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably lost half a gram that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you know, what I'll do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pick it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hold the torch and I'll just,
you know, waft it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll use my thumb as like a guard to
protect the heat.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that worked fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: That worked great.
[SPEAKER_14]: You were attempting to blowtorch the hash
lightly to kind of melt it a little to
[SPEAKER_14]: make it more workable.
[SPEAKER_14]: In between two pieces of parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is some high quality concentrate.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely some of the best hash
around, you know, town.
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this is working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just set it down and do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to me, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold it in your hands or yeah,
I burned a bunch of money that day for
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just went poof up in flame.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was way too late by that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, yeah, it's like a match
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt bad for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nobody else did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all laughed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned something though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it was totally, I laughed later.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't funny to him in the moment,
but it was great.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll continue to be funny to
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_12]: Break time really sucked at that point in
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I was done with the day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did anybody bring any shatter?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I'm out, because I'm broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you burned it all on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got a little over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was an expensive fucking day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got some unicorn hash for Friday
night.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually dabbed up all my unicorn hash
last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got about a little, half a little
container for Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what we saw today, but we saw a
unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just rarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the way to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I don't remember what it was now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll ask in the morning what we saw,
but it was definitely unicorn status.
[SPEAKER_14]: You saw something that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't even know what the fuck it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was just rare.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said I was going to read a news article.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to take a dab and then try that.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be like my third dab of
the day when it's 9.15.
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually I start off the day with a couple
of fat dads.
[SPEAKER_14]: If that tells you anything about how I
felt today.
[SPEAKER_14]: Been trying to get hydrated, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so hard to get hydrated once you're
dehydrated and being sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't drink that then.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't drink this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The bong water?
[SPEAKER_14]: You're just like, got to get hydrated.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about being hydrated and
pick up the rig.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for being a friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: That would have been miserable.
[SPEAKER_14]: Danger, danger.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's probably like a good gram of
reclaimed just floating on top of that
[SPEAKER_14]: shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: That would have been the worst drink ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody out there would definitely pay
money to just like scrape your pipes and
[SPEAKER_14]: your reclaim.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was on tiny chat last night and I showed
somebody my hash and he's like,
[SPEAKER_14]: is that your dab?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he goes, just dab it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I weighed it and it was 0.5.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I typed it's 0.5 and he just nodded
like, uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, God damn it, this guy
knows me.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I did a half gram dab last night.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I went to bed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes I am on bong TV live guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you wondered, but if you're ever
cruising through bong TV live and you see
[SPEAKER_14]: that white guy with the dreadlocks and an
Irish shirt, I've always got my sunglasses
[SPEAKER_14]: and a hat on taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's me, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Rasta Jeff on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Say what's up if you want to.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody talk while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking earlier today that 50 is
going to be jam packed full of chaos and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so pumped.
[SPEAKER_03]: For 50, like the giveaway and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure everybody's pumped for,
but I'm just pumped to get everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already been 50 episodes,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was just talking about that with
them today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you really keep track of them
and put a number to them, it hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You realize how far it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes so quickly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every week I do an episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done a couple of episodes,
uh, weeks where I've done multiple
[SPEAKER_14]: episodes too.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to be able to do that,
but I feel like I bore the people.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have enough content.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just me rambling when I do two
episodes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a big dab for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: It might, we might need to get you some of
that floria after this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pumped for the crowd.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like all these people gatherings.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's usually two people you enjoy and 13
people that like you tolerate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if, if the guest list for 50 shows up
and everyone's here, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: sick.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, well they set the date.
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully, yeah, uh, Spitz and Maddie
were the ones that said when we're doing
[SPEAKER_14]: this, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw Adam hitting the rig and I heard
that noise.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, what the fuck just happened?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you got some claim on you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that burn?
[SPEAKER_12]: Not after a long day of work.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a light coating of hot metal
shavings over most of his hands.
[SPEAKER_12]: You probably take them right here in front
of my hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rig bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, uh, yeah, it's on mic.
[SPEAKER_14]: As long as it doesn't involve anything
with me putting my hands over my head,
[SPEAKER_14]: it can burn.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the worst part of your guys' job
from what I've heard is hanging drywall
[SPEAKER_14]: and metal beams above your head all day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing anything above your head.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone just went silent after that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm totally down to carry soil or water or
whatever because it's below my waist.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no more ceiling.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, at the new grow at the spot,
there's no like carrying.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are carts, like, you know,
the janitor cart.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got one of those for all my shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like just push it around or I'm sure
they'll be there eventually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm just, I'm so excited to have
upgraded from my smaller facilities and
[SPEAKER_14]: then I've gone from one of my first grows
was in my mom's basement, in the closet,
[SPEAKER_14]: in a grow hut, like in a little tiny,
tiny.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I've got, if you combine- Five
gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's all it took.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Flush the plants by carrying them to the
bathtub and just rinse them out a little
[SPEAKER_14]: bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are you guys getting that oil on you
from?
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's it coming from on there?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll clean it up if you can identify the
leak.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's just coming out of the carb
gap on us like probably is the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that you say that everything over here
is just dirty.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to.
[SPEAKER_11]: You think you dirty?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I cleaned yours the other day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need a cleaner monkey that just walks
around behind me and cleans up after me
[SPEAKER_14]: all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me tell you people, if you think you
smoke a lot of dabs, like there are resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's fucking reclaimed coming
off the end of the torch here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got five oil slick pads on the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all just stained to shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all stuck together.
[SPEAKER_14]: A carb cap sitting right in the middle of
the table, just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_14]: A non-picky person could get dabbed the
fuck out off the claim stuck to my oil
[SPEAKER_14]: slick pads.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had someone ask me for the reclaim in my
work rig the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, it's pretty substantial.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a cheap little rig.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as long as I can suck through it,
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I never even considered it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I just like mix that shit with
fucking formula 420 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just get it right out of there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen a lot of people make edibles out
of the reclaim.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't sound nasty.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: All this BHO talk leads me right into this
news article that I was attempting to
[SPEAKER_14]: read.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to hear a couple of weird
breaths from me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can feel my nose trying to run.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It says, a court hearing Wednesday to
determine the legal status of marijuana
[SPEAKER_14]: hash oil in post-legislation Colorado
resulted in the judge turning up his hands
[SPEAKER_14]: and shrugging his shoulders in
exasperation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike's pulling out his phone to take a
picture of me because I got this big wad
[SPEAKER_14]: of toilet paper stuffed in my nose while
I'm doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't, but now I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_14]: The nasal tampon.
[SPEAKER_14]: The hearing in Denver district court was
to decide whether a man named Paul
[SPEAKER_14]: Maneoni, Maneoni?
[SPEAKER_14]: Maneoni.
[SPEAKER_14]: If this guy, Paul, who was one of the
three people charged after an explosion at
[SPEAKER_14]: a Southwest Denver warehouse can be
prosecuted for the crime of manufacturing
[SPEAKER_14]: marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_14]: The man's attorney, Rob Corey,
who helped write Colorado's marijuana
[SPEAKER_14]: legalization law said Maneoni can't be
charged because of Colorado's constitution
[SPEAKER_14]: now protects the personal possession of
marijuana and the processing of marijuana
[SPEAKER_14]: plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: The court system is not to be used for
marijuana regulation anymore, Corey said.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish he would have said cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: It would have made it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Colorado attorney general argues
Maneoni can be charged because by virtue
[SPEAKER_14]: of a curiously placed comma in amendment
64, the legalization measure, the
[SPEAKER_14]: protection for marijuana does not cover
cannabis oil like hash oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: The measure says its definition for
marijuana does not include industrial
[SPEAKER_14]: hemp, nor does it include fiber produced
from the stocks, oil, or cake made from
[SPEAKER_14]: the seeds of the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: The attorney general's office,
which weighed in on Maneoni's case,
[SPEAKER_14]: even though it is not prosecuting the
case, has made a similar argument in a
[SPEAKER_14]: case in Mesa County.
[SPEAKER_14]: By the end of Wednesday's hearing,
Denver district judge A.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bruce Jones had concluded both sides were
wrong, though it was still unclear how he
[SPEAKER_14]: would ultimately rule.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jones said he plans to deny Corey's motion
to drop the charge, meaning the case
[SPEAKER_14]: against Maneoni can proceed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's kind of, we're getting into the
part where it's all technical.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hash oil is the potent goop left over
after marijuana's active chemicals are
[SPEAKER_14]: dissolved from the underlying plant
material.
[SPEAKER_14]: That guy tried real hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: He tried hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hash oil is the hash that we want.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone involved in this story and this
article is at best trying hard.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody succeeded.
[SPEAKER_14]: The cannabis often tries really hard,
but they need somebody.
[SPEAKER_14]: They need a guy like you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: You should contact the cannabis and be
like, hey, you guys say a lot of dumb
[SPEAKER_14]: shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: They tell their stories right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing is inaccurate here except the
wording.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hash oil is the potent goop left over
after marijuana's active chemicals are
[SPEAKER_14]: dissolved.
[SPEAKER_12]: The oil, the sentence in question in the
bill is about hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you take hemp seed and you gather it up
and you press it sort of like you do
[SPEAKER_12]: grapes to make wine, you get an oil that
you can make everything you can make with
[SPEAKER_12]: oil, oil, like Texans haul out of the
ground oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what they're referencing in
that part of the bill.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hash oil isn't oil, oil or cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: We just call it oil because it kind of
looks like it's honey oil when it comes
[SPEAKER_12]: out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love watching it drip out of the end of
the tube.
[SPEAKER_12]: Over a descriptive slang term.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because that's what I keep thinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, it's not really an oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: The judge isn't going to drop the case
because I'm pretty sure this fucked up,
[SPEAKER_12]: blew up his house.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there's more to the story.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me read part of that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Blowing up your house has long been a
crime in Colorado that was not legalized
[SPEAKER_12]: at any time recently.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's something that Rob Corey
mentions and I'm going to have an argument
[SPEAKER_14]: later on in the story.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you agree with me now.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like forward thinking people.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have to sit in the back seat of
our minds and fucking let everybody else
[SPEAKER_14]: drive us think forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: So hash oil, they describe it wrong.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it says a popular amateur
production method uses compressed butane
[SPEAKER_14]: gas, which can lead to dangerous
explosions like the one that rocked the
[SPEAKER_14]: 1200 block of South Lippen street last
April.
[SPEAKER_14]: Manny Yoni is also charged with arson in
connection with that blast.
[SPEAKER_14]: During Wednesday's hearing, Corey argued
that home hash oil explosions are
[SPEAKER_14]: mistakes, but not illegal.
[SPEAKER_14]: I compare it to frying a turkey,
Corey said.
[SPEAKER_14]: Accidents don't mean a crime has occurred.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jones didn't seem impressed, calling some
of Corey's arguments circular,
[SPEAKER_14]: but Jones also criticized an attorney
general's position.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to tell him he's wrong.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to tell him he's way wrong,
Jones said.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he compared it to if I'm cooking a
chicken and I burn the apartment building
[SPEAKER_14]: down or a turkey, then I made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think I'm still recklessly
endangering people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think charges are going to be
pressed on me even if I do burn down my
[SPEAKER_14]: apartment building, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're frying a turkey in the living
room of your apartment, you're A,
[SPEAKER_12]: an idiot, B, violating the fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: What if I'm doing it in the kitchen?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, the kitchen too.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're going to fry a turkey,
you got to take that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm cooking dinner in the kitchen and
I'm just cooking normal food, I got veggie
[SPEAKER_14]: burgers and some fucking vegetables and
some rice and some macaroni.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I fucking, I take a dab and I come
back and the kitchen's on fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I going to face charges for something
now?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, as long as you were just, it was
innocent.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might be legally liable for damages or
something.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of that depends on where you are at
the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mike's not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_12]: He just stated a holiday in express last
night.
[SPEAKER_12]: That part of Corey's argument here is
correct, but that doesn't apply to butane
[SPEAKER_12]: hash oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're venting cans of flammable gas into
an enclosed space.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is actually an OSHA crime,
I think.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a special thing in the fire code
for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I asked the fire chief down here,
because Pueblo outlawed making a BHO a
[SPEAKER_12]: while ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when the vote passed, right after it
passed, I stood up and walked back to the
[SPEAKER_12]: fire chief and jokingly asked,
venting cans of butane into your living
[SPEAKER_12]: room and lighting a match has been illegal
for how long?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he chuckled and went, longer than I've
been on the job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't dump gasoline around your
apartment and light a match.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you're venting cans of butane
inside, you're venting cans of flammable
[SPEAKER_12]: gas into an enclosed space.
[SPEAKER_12]: If your pilot light kicks on, your
eyebrows are kicking off.
[SPEAKER_12]: All your windows are kicking out and
you're going to the burn unit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the burn and not the good burn unit.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's not a special charge for...
Well, yeah, there used to be a place we
[SPEAKER_14]: called the burn units where we used to go
burn.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've been dangerous.
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard a dub band once called burn unit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to finish the article.
[SPEAKER_14]: Caught almost on the sidelines was the
Denver district attorney's office,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is actually prosecuting the case.
[SPEAKER_14]: A deputy district attorney said the hash
oil qualifies as pot.
[SPEAKER_14]: But he said there's a difference between
amendment 64's protection for processing
[SPEAKER_14]: marijuana and the state laws for
criminalizing of manufacturing
[SPEAKER_14]: concentrated marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jones is expected to issue his ruling in
the coming weeks.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're saying that there's a major
difference between processing,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is properly doing that shit in a
facility, in a tested, authorized,
[SPEAKER_14]: MED approved lab.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's also been state regulated by the
health department.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's like seven different agencies
that want to come in and inspect your shit
[SPEAKER_14]: if you're growing and making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then manufacturing concentrated
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was doing that in his house,
open blasting.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's where the change
happens.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess the point is don't fucking
blast indoors.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't open blast if you're going to blast,
get a closed loop and you can still fuck
[SPEAKER_14]: up, do that safely.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's yet to be a news story about
someone hurting themselves, making BHO
[SPEAKER_12]: outside.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those news stories don't happen because
people don't get hurt that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of a good point.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just take it to your backyard,
numbnuts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone I know that's never blown
themselves up does it that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of those things where it's not
complicated.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was taught how to make my extracts
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty much, I knew that already,
but they're like, you always do this
[SPEAKER_14]: outside was the first thing they said.
[SPEAKER_12]: Step one, check the weather.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there's any other news that
we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_14]: Something's weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone blew up a house with alcohol here
in Pueblo the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's hilarious in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is one of the largest alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were on one of the routes for the
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a huge prohibition town.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have tunnels under this town where
people used to move alcohol from private
[SPEAKER_14]: houses where it was made to clubs,
downtown and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: It scares me to death.
[SPEAKER_14]: Why does it scares you, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: My kids are going to grow up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: My kids are wild.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to find that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have found that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have found that shit real quick.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not hidden, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're closed up now.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_14]: Most are closed up.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I lived in a house.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are different tunnels.
[SPEAKER_14]: I lived in a house in an area.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know if I should talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a part of town called Goat Hill.
[SPEAKER_14]: Many years ago, I don't remember the exact
year, so I don't want to be wrong and try
[SPEAKER_14]: to say I have an idea in my head,
but many years ago, this town flooded up
[SPEAKER_14]: to like the third story window of a lot of
buildings downtown.
[SPEAKER_11]: 1916, I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: It could have been.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll agree with you.
[SPEAKER_14]: That way Jesse could be wrong and I won't.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say 1929, but I really have
no idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: A long time ago, when the picture were
yellow, when they took pictures of shit,
[SPEAKER_14]: everything was yellow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But this town flooded.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a hill near, it used to be First
Street.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's fucking Center City Drive or some
dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so dumb.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's First Street, bitches.
[SPEAKER_14]: Why'd you change that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Right up there, there was a hill and it
was called Goat Hill.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where allegedly all of the Italians
that lived here went and moved to that top
[SPEAKER_14]: of the hill and took all their livestock
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: They had goats up there and that part of
town became known as Goat Hill.
[SPEAKER_14]: In my house, I had a hatch that lifted up
in my bedroom and you could lift up that
[SPEAKER_14]: and you'd end up in a hidden basement
part.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then there was definitely a hole that had
been bricked over.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure that that hole was part of
those tunnels.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I was in a band that did a show at
the Damon Runyon Theater downtown,
[SPEAKER_14]: which used to be the chief.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go to one of the little back areas
by the kitchen, there's a tunnel that's
[SPEAKER_14]: blocked off and the security guard
wouldn't let me go past that area.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just in the opening band and he's
like, you can't go back here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, I'm in the band.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, you can't go back here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, all right, I tried.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those tunnels used to be used.
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet that tunnel and the tunnel I found
connect somewhere, somehow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably this.
[SPEAKER_14]: The hooch was made at the top of the hill
up on Goat Hill and then it was ran and
[SPEAKER_14]: money probably.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to know why Pueblo has people
in it, you can watch two documentaries on
[SPEAKER_12]: Netflix.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them is Prohibition and the other
one is The Great Dust Bowl.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ken Burns is amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ken Burns is the shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm writing those down to watch them
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you watch both of those, Pueblo makes
perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of stuff here where people
that move here are like, what's with that?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a question they ask a bunch their
first year and the answer is either
[SPEAKER_12]: Prohibition or the Dust Bowl.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: This town is old school.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a stop on the Santa Fe trail.
[SPEAKER_14]: This used to be called Little Chicago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three, four rivers meet here going all
different directions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like between here and the county.
[SPEAKER_14]: Two major highways meet here now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So now we get a lot of weird shit here.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got highway 50 going east and west all
the way across the country.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I-25 goes north and south almost all
the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Canada, I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know, might stop somewhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: What even got us on that weird rant?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dabbs.
[SPEAKER_14]: This weird rant was brought to you by
Dabbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to the Garden of Wheaton.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I love it when I see those little
envelopes.
[SPEAKER_12]: My smile goes from big to just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Their new packaging is definitely stylish.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys made me feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming over and making me snap
out of my funk.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been moping around all day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did get a little bit of work done.
[SPEAKER_14]: I put, I've been talking about the black
cherry chem fino hunt that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how much you're talking about
it on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sprouted, I sprouted 40 seeds and 35 of
them made it to the flower room,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is actually pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_14]: When that many of them make it all the way
to flower, that means that there were
[SPEAKER_14]: five, like maybe, I don't remember
exactly, but some didn't germinate,
[SPEAKER_14]: some were runt, and then some I just
didn't feel like they were worth the
[SPEAKER_14]: space.
[SPEAKER_14]: So 35 of them made it to flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: Today I moved 11 of them into another room
because they are males.
[SPEAKER_14]: My goal is to find a purple male and a
green male.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully the light went off.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to go check that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm supposed to go off at nine.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're in a new room that got started
tonight.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see how that worked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully I find a purple male and a green
male, and hopefully I find a purple female
[SPEAKER_14]: and a green female, and I'm going to kind
of collect pollen and sort of cube things
[SPEAKER_14]: and see if I can't make F2s that come out
consistently purple.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to work them to F5,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds ridiculous, but I want to work
them to F5 to where they're purple clones
[SPEAKER_02]: of each other when they come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if something ever happens, I can't get
it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strong shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what any of that meant,
but that's why we bring out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I just ran and raved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else did either.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all like, what the hell did that
rave?
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike's done immune to it now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working together and he turns around
and glares at me.
[SPEAKER_12]: 30 seconds later, he turns around and
glares again.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like a black Larry Burke.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got to be awesomely out of place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not me, by the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Way across the room, perfectly into the
trash can.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_14]: Practice, practice.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a three pointer for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: But Adam's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you're an asshole.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love how spontaneous and untamed you
are.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no filter.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give them a tape measure and a stack of
aluminum framing studs and just let them
[SPEAKER_12]: go to where you can steal.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like taking it into a restaurant where
there's like more than five ingredients on
[SPEAKER_14]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my hand doesn't work right
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take me to fucking like Hotel Jota,
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they take me in there like,
what do you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, everything's in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tacos, I guess?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking dig it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that say hamburger?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not getting a hamburger here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why not?
[SPEAKER_11]: We forget he's not from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how quickly he's got into the
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told him all the other day, I told him
all the other day, like I'm screw
[SPEAKER_02]: McDonald's and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm, we haven't ate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get Subway every now and
then, but just because it's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, can I have a little GMO in
your life or else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yoga mat bread.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I guarantee the food at the Mexican
place is chock full of GMOs too.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't get 80 cent tacos for... They
weren't 80 cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you how much right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you take him?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they didn't speak English.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time me and Fish went in there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even the first one to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got three chicken tacos for three bucks.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's different kinds of Mexican food
places in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's three taco stops on that street.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want good tacos.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got like Pueblo style Mexican.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is like taco casa and taco stop and
burritos beddies.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where you get green chili and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you got like the actual Mexicano.
[SPEAKER_11]: Street tacos.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you tell them you want green chili,
you get green chilies diced.
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the guy that carries around the
cooler and he goes, burritos?
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of those dudes are fucking awesome
too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I worked at guitar center,
there was a little lady that used to come
[SPEAKER_14]: in all the time with the burritos.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody would buy those.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't buy, I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty strict about what I'll eat.
[SPEAKER_14]: But those guys would buy the burritos and
about 30 minutes later, then I'll have to
[SPEAKER_14]: go take a fat dump.
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't find it all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're like, they're so good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're dying and they're a fucker,
I can tell.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one chick and her son.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I see her, I'm like,
I've been buying them since I worked
[SPEAKER_11]: construction 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, yeah, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_11]: They always have a little fried stuff,
sopapias.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: They used to go to the Pixie.
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to be in the house band at the
Pixie and they'd show up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Her son always goes to the bars.
[SPEAKER_14]: I still got this Kleenex in my nose and it
feels so weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all soggy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sort of impressed it's still there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's so soggy, it's not going
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it swell up?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it did.
[SPEAKER_14]: It puffed up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it for a light day or a heavy day?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for a medium flow.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm doing that black cherry fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got five black cherries right now
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you later.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're actually kind of old.
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet you're used to the black cherry
shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Nano Lux love is they're taking the
fuck off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, we're going to have a lot of cool
prizes on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just listening to the banter that
was happening on the show with four of us
[SPEAKER_14]: and with six people happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be a mess.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to come up with some contest if
you guys got any ideas.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some contest?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: A way to give away all the cool prizes
that we've got.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've got a couple of cool ideas.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to number the prize packs so
that this is like the biggest one will be
[SPEAKER_14]: number one and we'll work our way down to
the smaller prizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be number five and then we'll do
some sort of contest and whoever does
[SPEAKER_14]: better at the contest will win a place in
the pricing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll let you ask for which prize
you want so that you don't want a t-shirt
[SPEAKER_14]: or you want a t-shirt and you win a
fucking ballast.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you live in Florida and it can't grow
and all you wanted was an ivory shirt and
[SPEAKER_14]: we send you something cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you've got a $300 bulb.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to try not to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Feeding nutrients to the ornamental plants
in the apartment complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: My azaleas really took off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all that botanic care and grow kashi
to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're definitely going to have to get
together right before the show a little
[SPEAKER_14]: bit and talk about what we're giving away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never win it but if I wasn't,
you know, one of the dudes sitting at the
[SPEAKER_02]: table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know but I'm just saying like I'd never
win it but if I'm telling you now if I
[SPEAKER_02]: was, I'd try.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna have to be some rules,
huh?
[SPEAKER_14]: If you put it on the show then I guess you
can't win.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody should do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just sitting here thinking there's
some stuff in that box that I would fully
[SPEAKER_12]: be like, I'm sick and I'd go home and play
like create new user names.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Long time listener, first time caller.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also doing a Lemon Jeffrey cross to
the Grateful Dog Fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, those look amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got five of them in there and they
look... There's two of us in the room that
[SPEAKER_02]: just went, ugh.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen... I got somebody else growing
it and they're, no, they're not growing
[SPEAKER_14]: that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're growing that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many projects, so few babies.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've sent so many seeds to so many people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, guys, I was promising more seeds to
Nature's Green Remedies.
[SPEAKER_14]: I might have fucked up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't make enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: I seriously didn't make enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: All my friends, all my locals are sucking
up all the seeds that I made.
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, I'm going to get my crew
around here seeds before I mail a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: shit out to a distributor.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seems like grow from the heart is
my name of my show.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been my motto for years.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like my community is right here
and I don't need to go sending stuff out
[SPEAKER_14]: to somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_11]: It helps you produce a better product too.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does because I get to see clones.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get to go to these people's gardens.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get to see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, you'll get seeds from me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm always making more.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jesse's on the team now.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's making more.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got breeding space somewhere else
now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm always making more.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just hard to keep up, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are hungry for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing what I can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been wanting seeds since I've been
here and I've just never had money at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, look at all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a whole table full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, so which ones do you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, the ones that you're throwing
away over there would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pale ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ruts, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll get one of those to sprout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Timing everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Timing is kind of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_14]: We know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've done it enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: But getting your males started.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then if I put three or four or four or
five females in the room with that male,
[SPEAKER_14]: sometimes they have to go into flower four
or five, six or seven, eight or 10 days
[SPEAKER_14]: apart from each other to time up when the
females are ovulating to take that pollen.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: And different males dump at different
times.
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, what I did, I'll admit this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I make my own silver thiosulfate and I
tried a new method and I over applied and
[SPEAKER_14]: my male plants turned male super quick,
quicker than I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, they didn't make any
pollen.
[SPEAKER_14]: They made some, but not nearly as much as
I had anticipated, not what I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got about a quarter amount of the
seeds I expected to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a man enough to say that on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't fucked up y'all, but I learned
from it and I know not to do that again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Real life mistakes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a high level mistake too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're making that, you know,
don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you're beating yourself up.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I know not to do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I over applied.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sprayed too many times and I made it too
strong and sprayed too many times.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're back to the number of sprays.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the issue you were going
through and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well it worked.
[SPEAKER_14]: I solved that issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: Created a whole new mess of problems for
myself doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't spray your hash with a torch.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, we're all learning shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't learn or if you don't fuck
up, you don't learn.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm, I think I taught you
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I've said that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I taught you that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's taught me that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Life has taught me that trust me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but I fucked up on a big scale.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I was going big and I kind of ruined
some shit by doing it, but we all do.
[SPEAKER_14]: It made a lot of good hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those plants that did not get seeded made
a hell of a lot of good hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that works.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody get your cannabis cup tickets.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Denver cannabis cup is coming.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not endorsed by high times.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not paid to say this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to see you guys there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will not have a booth, but I will be
cruising around having fun saying what's
[SPEAKER_14]: up to people.
[SPEAKER_14]: I plan on being there all three days most
likely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we all just rent a van and a house?
[SPEAKER_02]: A house would be cool, but we're all meat
eaters.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be like, you guys stink.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a whole bunch of us that want to
go.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, well I've got my tickets.
[SPEAKER_11]: I may be into that option.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheap people for life.
[SPEAKER_14]: I usually do a pretty good hotel for those
kinds of events.
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm there for three days, I want some
luxury.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how we do it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Somewhere with a balcony.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can open that balcony door there,
the sliding glass door and chill out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: This sounds like I'm going to be working a
booth for someone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I think I know who you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me know about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I could use some wristbands.
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard something about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just thinking the same thing,
boss.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do what I can.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have wristbands that we'll be able to
trade out for another event.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you'll be very interested in
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's before the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's something coming up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I need to grow a fat crop or something?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before April?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an accessories event.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone's going over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get your cannabis cup tickets so that we
can all hang out and have fun there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't be a mooch.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really trying.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not trying to suck up wristbands from the
vendors.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to MedCanCup.com.
[SPEAKER_14]: The tickets right now, what I bought was a
three day early bird special for like 85
[SPEAKER_14]: bucks plus a $5 and 50 cent service
fucking stick it in your butt fee.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does not include any concert tickets
because I actually plan on seeing Doug
[SPEAKER_14]: Benson.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a ticket to see Doug Benson on
420 at ComedyWorks at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not going to the Snoop Dogg concert
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that sounds weak.
[SPEAKER_14]: But Doug Benson is actually a friend of
mine and it's a comedy taping.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my favorite comedians taping their
new comedy special at my favorite comedy
[SPEAKER_14]: club in the country.
[SPEAKER_14]: On our holiday.
[SPEAKER_14]: On 420 with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll even say it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: The high times concerts aren't that cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just, they're not.
[SPEAKER_14]: You kind of reach an age where a concert
is just like, it's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you love to see bands.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're outdoors in April in Colorado and
you don't know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_12]: I take shorts and a parka.
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw.
[SPEAKER_14]: We wear shorts all day because at the cup,
it's nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: You're rocking shorts and a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you get in the car and you go eat
dinner and you go to the hotel and you got
[SPEAKER_14]: to change into like pants and long sleeves
and a hoodie and put some chapstick on
[SPEAKER_14]: your lips.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause we went out to Red Rocks for
Slightly Stupid.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not dissing the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: We went out to Red Rocks and it was so
windy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go see Slightly Stupid at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just not on 420.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard anyone say, yeah,
I wouldn't go see them at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody seen anybody at Red Rocks?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: January 30th at Red Rocks is Damian Marley
and a couple of other bands.
Yeah.
Man.
[SPEAKER_14]: People are going to freeze their tits off
out there.
Seriously?
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought they shut that bitch down.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they're just doing shows out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: January 30th at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Damian and someone else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Damian's from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe out there in a parka.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some sort of evil joke.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a whole bunch of cool running
moments flashed in my head.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's probably coinciding with that X
Games shit or something else going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know for sure, but I would just
assume since that's the way events like to
[SPEAKER_14]: do it, they piggyback on each other just
to make money.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they make it seem like it's just a
nice casual trip.
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably going to a heated stage by now,
you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: A heated stage.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Red Rocks is treacherous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you imagine all the fucking ice
demelter shit they're going to have to
[SPEAKER_11]: spray all over that fucking entire
concrete surface?
[SPEAKER_14]: And the muddy parking lot?
[SPEAKER_11]: One slip at the top and it all over.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm going to see Ari Shaffir at
ComedyWorks on that day on the 30th,
[SPEAKER_14]: January 30th, I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't talked to my buddy about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's working nights now and I'm on this
weird random podcast life schedule.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I might be going to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're listening to this, message me.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see if we're doing that and we'll
see if there's room for one more in the
[SPEAKER_14]: car or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have anything going on at the
time, but yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just told him the other day that he
should come with us to Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his wife there, you know,
spending the weekend and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, she can stay at home with the
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about my wife, not yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally lost my train of thought with that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to talk to somebody about
something and I was like, as soon as I
[SPEAKER_03]: said it, it stopped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I was like, all right, now where
was I?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: People with ADD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody got any plugs to do?
[SPEAKER_14]: Any shout outs or anything?
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Naptime.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to my whole crew.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have been killing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been present on the job site for
a few days for some family reasons.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've just been slaying it for me and
taking care of business.
[SPEAKER_14]: We wish you the best on the family things.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: All those fucks there.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Matty's been killing it at the store
for us, filling in there too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Matty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also killing it, slaying it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Slaying it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That girl can grow some weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying not to sneeze right at the show
closing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I made it almost all the way through the
show and I'm getting that watery eye thing
[SPEAKER_14]: like I'm about to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm totally going to sneeze,
but I want to give a shout out to my girl,
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela, what's up babe?
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to give a shout out to The Spot
Dispensary, all the sponsors that have
[SPEAKER_14]: sponsored the show and Task and the Mystic
Roots, Task Rock and the Mystic Roots band
[SPEAKER_14]: separately.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not Task and the Mystic Roots band.

[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody sent me a logo, but it needed

[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you're listening to Down Under.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just so busy right now, just like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just got some free time and he said,
I literally just like hopped on the other
[SPEAKER_02]: night and just kind of was like,

[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, he's one of those guys who was in the
garage kind of guy, computer guy in the
[SPEAKER_14]: garage.
[SPEAKER_14]: He just built a picture in my head.

[SPEAKER_14]: I want to give a huge shout out to these
boys for showing up today and making a
[SPEAKER_14]: great podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't do any preparations and we
slayed this show, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: We slayed it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We crushed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We totally like nerded up and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some snowboarder talk a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is wicked gnarly, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hitting some pow pow.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just going to end this before this
gets out of control.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to give a big shout out to my ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Until next time, take a fat dad and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right as
[SPEAKER_14]: the show starts, I look over and Spencer's
just giggling.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to episode number 50 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't even talk.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody made it on time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody is here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to episode number 50, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just going to introduce everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: To the left, we got white Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_14]: To the further left, we got Jesse.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of to the front, we got Maddie.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, y'all?
[SPEAKER_14]: We're already off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_14]: So holding a microphone over there is
Spence from Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_14]: Spence and Maddie are sharing a mic.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're holding it and- We're going to
attempt to share the mic.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that every time it's Maddie's turn
to talk, she's going to get punched in the
[SPEAKER_14]: head with the microphone.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not endorse domestic violence,
but- No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's really cute the way it's
happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not violent.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cute.
[SPEAKER_14]: Over here to my right, at the three o
'clock position, we got Mr. Adam Gasgans.
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 44 in the house.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 50, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody made it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks a lot, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just nodded and smiled.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nodded and smiled.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't fucking work on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to vocalize your- Can't hear your
head shake.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the resin rocks in your head rattling
around.
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody brought some all night,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jesse brought some great prizes from Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies here.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just going to do this weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just going to do it just like this.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll jump and do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies,
this podcast is brought to you by Hygro
[SPEAKER_14]: Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super huge shout out to Hygro.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have two locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: Visit the Denver store, 6271 Beach Street,
or of course, our favorite, though I can't
[SPEAKER_14]: even speak today, our favorite Pueblo
location.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget, if you're listening to the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, all you have
[SPEAKER_14]: to do is tell them you listen to the show
and you will get commercial pricing when
[SPEAKER_14]: you check out at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, support them.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you listen to the show, you will hear
about some kick ass prizes they brought
[SPEAKER_14]: today.
[SPEAKER_14]: It took two men, two boxes of shit to
carry it into the house.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I added more to it when they got
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So huge shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried to save that for the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, man, a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really cool of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Adam, thanks for carrying it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for real.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad we have a podcast we can give
them away on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear about, Maddie said that one of the
listeners actually showed up at the store
[SPEAKER_14]: to meet Maddie and say hello the other
day.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a shout out to that person.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember their name?
[SPEAKER_14]: Microphone.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember his name, but I will see
him very soon because I have an order for
[SPEAKER_10]: him.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for shopping.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully one time I bump into you at the
store there.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be pretty cool because I shop at
the store kind of frequently.
[SPEAKER_14]: That kind of guy that never goes and gets
everything I need.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go buy a bunch of shit and as soon as
I get home, I'll go, oh yeah, I needed
[SPEAKER_14]: OGT.
[SPEAKER_14]: You too?
[SPEAKER_10]: That one thing that you needed and you
always forget.
Always.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I try to stand around in the store and
look around like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I literally go and just,
people ask me, can I help you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: This shelf here and everywhere over that
way.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember I was thinking about cutting
clones.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got to be in the cloning area.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can use about six of those.
[SPEAKER_14]: You needed clone X and you went home
without clone X.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the only thing you needed.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do need to send a big thank you shout
out to the Mystic Roots band for letting
[SPEAKER_14]: me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks to Kat Koot and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Stay Positive Productions crew.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: They let me use their song on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the most important paper I had to
get through.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike brought up a really interesting
topic.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were going to do some giveaways and
shit, but I got a couple of things to talk
[SPEAKER_14]: about before we get into there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike brought up a really interesting
topic.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys might've seen it on TMZ.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw it online this morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ralphie May came to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: It had himself a little accident with some
edibles.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right before a performance, apparently the
police had to be called to quiet the
[SPEAKER_12]: pissed crowd when Ralphie was way too
zonked to even finish a sentence.
[SPEAKER_14]: They showed video of Ralphie May being
escorted out of the back of the comedy
[SPEAKER_14]: club by the police because the crowd was
so pissed off at him.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were demanding their money back and
he was just smiling and like, I love you
[SPEAKER_14]: guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: You wouldn't let me do my bits.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was waving like he was a princess
or some shit was really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen Ralphie May high as shit
before, and I've never seen Ralphie May
[SPEAKER_14]: that high.
[SPEAKER_14]: He talks about doing a lot of drugs.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to read the labels, people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Read the labels.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fun size don't mean fun size.
[SPEAKER_14]: Read the label.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know it's Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_14]: He probably ate something and went,
damn, this is delicious.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just started eating all of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes the arm eats for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't even know you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's kind of a big dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he probably thought a thousand
milligrams ain't shit for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_14]: His brain is just the same size as
everybody else's.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_14]: This episode won't be out for like two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that'll be old news by then,
but we read it today.
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought it was freaking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ralphie May, you're the new Moreno Dowd.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you work that into your next bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope that's funny at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, it'll be too late, but the new
Ari Shaffir comedy special is on at
[SPEAKER_14]: midnight tonight.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to catch that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Paid regular with Ari.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_14]: When Spence was here last time,
we talked about the best shit of the year
[SPEAKER_14]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_14]: We left out something super duper freaking
important.
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't even mention live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the only reason we probably didn't
talk about it is because it's nothing new
[SPEAKER_04]: to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was like the thing for 2014.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was something we definitely should have
talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked to people today that were like,
I still haven't seen any live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just Joe Blow like pulls them out
of his pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yo, I got some right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's just like, the guy's
just like, oh, he's one, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to enter some shit to a competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you just won.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, live resin is definitely a big pickup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something new, especially with,
you know, the addition of closed loop,
[SPEAKER_04]: it kind of really came about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Emotech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Giddy, Emotech, Kind Bill,
that whole crew that kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: put the forward push.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Live resin did a lot for you, of course.
[SPEAKER_14]: It did a lot for Emo and Giddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It did a lot for Hanky B and the greener
side, kinda.
[SPEAKER_14]: As a residual, it actually, your win in
the secret cup boosted up my Instagram
[SPEAKER_14]: following.
[SPEAKER_14]: It made me more known.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, live resin kind of boosted us all
up in the scene a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe we forgot about live on
the year review episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was big.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maddie's shaking her head all
flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe we did either.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was such a big part of the end of our
year, especially with the secret cups.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and it was awesome to win the secret
cup regionals.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: We met a lot of people in Denver through
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And people still talk to me, like,
I'm part of your crew.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you grew that well.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, I didn't grow it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, they grow it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They fucking pop the seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: They shatter it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They blast it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have to correct people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I let them know that you grew that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I never take credit for your guys' grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't grow that stuff, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Soil to oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually the stuff for, I may have grown a
couple of theirs, but I've taken credit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've taken credit for those.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is kind of a random note.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lady messaged me on Instagram and kind
of called me out.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said that, and I'm sure I said this,
but I don't remember the exact words.
[SPEAKER_14]: In an older episode, I kind of tried to
cover my ass legally with a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like if you live in an illegal state,
don't grow weed, follow the rules and all
[SPEAKER_14]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to say that kind of shit to cover my
ass.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, technically, if I come on
the air and I say, Hey, if you live in
[SPEAKER_14]: Florida, fuck all the rules, grow all the
weed you can.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I'm going to get in
trouble for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So to cover my own ass, I just say,
follow the rules, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that you should grow your own
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're smoking cannabis, if you're
consuming cannabis, if you like it
[SPEAKER_14]: recreationally, if you like it medically,
grow the fuck out of it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my new stance on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't arrest us all.
[SPEAKER_14]: They might arrest me for saying that,
but if they do, somebody else make a
[SPEAKER_14]: bad-ass podcast and keep this going for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, if you are going to do it
illegally, if you do it somewhat
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibly and you're willing to go to
court for that, then so be it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you may be the change that your
state or your community, your community is
[SPEAKER_14]: needed.
[SPEAKER_14]: So plant more seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys grow more weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't be a hypocrite.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grow a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you should too, but also know the
risks.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've got kids in the house,
you can lose the kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: When the DEA comes, they're going to shoot
your dog most likely when they come in the
[SPEAKER_14]: door.
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be traumatizing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to fuck up your life.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're prepared for that, if you can
handle that, if you're a man and or woman
[SPEAKER_14]: enough, if you're transgender enough,
I'm not trying to exclude anybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to include all of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you are a person enough and you can
handle that shit, grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just know what the risks are.
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not being a hypocrite.
[SPEAKER_14]: She also called me out for dabbing in the
car and telling people not to.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a professional lady.
[SPEAKER_14]: I could dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you find yourself to be a professional,
dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: The people I was talking shit to were not
professional.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a nice little system in my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been there with him and it's always
parked in very certain locations where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, this is dab approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know good spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not pulling up next to the park
like, hey, see those kids on the swing
[SPEAKER_03]: over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it ain't happening like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand certain places between here
and like Boulder, Longmont, Broomfield,
[SPEAKER_14]: Fort Collins that I know to pull off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I can pull off right here.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a little gas station with a car
wash.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love to go in the car wash at the gas
station and get my car washed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never even considered that before.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that you've said that, I have to try
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody can see you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your car is covered at all angles and
you're just in there dabbing out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the master shake too.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a perfect little car rig.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard for the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: A master shake is a little 10 mil rig.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no way to hold it up in the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nowhere to put it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just falls over when you drive.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is mostly the hitman mini cake.
[SPEAKER_14]: The cake rig fits the couple.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it fits in the couple.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen more than one email set up in a
car.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Otis Dabs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Otis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otis is always driving with the Pelly Nail
in the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: You see that dude dabbing in strip clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: He also dabbed on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did he really take the dab or did he just
show off the rig?
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see the dab part.
[SPEAKER_10]: He took a real dab on the plane.
[SPEAKER_14]: Winner.
[SPEAKER_14]: Winner, winner, vegan dinner.
[SPEAKER_14]: With a torch?
[SPEAKER_10]: With a torch and took a dab in the
bathroom and blew it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Took a video.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's still there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's still there or not.
[SPEAKER_14]: So shout out to that lady that kind of
called me out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I might have been hypocritical,
but honestly I was just trying to cover my
[SPEAKER_14]: own ass.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying not to go to jail and trying to
keep this podcast going.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't tell people in fucking Texas to
grow weed and not think that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_14]: get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_14]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're in Texas, grow some fucking
weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Grow it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Grow it with all your heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think it'd be easy to figure out
what our opinion was.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of what I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of a role model vibe is more or
less you want to put the correct
[SPEAKER_14]: information out there for people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, she called me out and I guess she
was right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I did say, don't do this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess I can't be a bitch about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just want to man up to that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where was I going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want to start this big old list of
shout outs?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm only like 11 minutes into the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have one more thing I have to do.

[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to do any more of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's read this big old list of shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let you guys go first.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys... Mike, if you got anybody
that you want to shout out or say anything
[SPEAKER_14]: to, because this is episode 50,
it's kind of time for like a celebration
[SPEAKER_14]: before we start giving away prizes and
shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone's looking at their phones.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to you, bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: 50 is huge.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of you guys are... Clint and Sean
should be here, but there aren't enough
[SPEAKER_14]: chairs, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: If I had two more chairs, Sean and Clint
would have been my next options to have
[SPEAKER_14]: here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to save Sean for when it's just
kind of focused.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can talk about some shit and Clint
would just derail the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be kind of fun just to
have them both on and Clint sit there and
[SPEAKER_03]: poke fun at him the whole time and he not
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I totally interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bad host.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I got right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Yeti OG Dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't expecting to thank people.
[SPEAKER_12]: 50 is huge, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been looking forward to this for a
while.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for the microphone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming on and you keep us
updated with our local politics and the
[SPEAKER_14]: local shit that we need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that reminding us about our
local stuff teaches our listeners that
[SPEAKER_14]: they can participate too, and it gets them
off the couch, which is what we need.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can be an activist in so many ways,
but you got to be off the couch to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Be ready to do local political work.
[SPEAKER_12]: If marijuana is getting legalized in your
state, as soon as it's legal at the state
[SPEAKER_12]: level, all sorts of nightmarish work
begins at the local level with the city
[SPEAKER_12]: and county level.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you don't have somebody in your
crew ready to step up on that,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's not going to go the way you want it
to.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're looking at local bands like
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm impressed with how friendly you have
become with some city council members.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be hanging out, taking dabs in the
phone will ring and he'd be like,
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's this city council member.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me for a minute.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, bro, you're at my house,
taking dabs, listening to reggae,
[SPEAKER_14]: and you're going to excuse yourself.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go talk to the city council manager.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're people too, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like if you call them, they call you back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Their job is to keep the constituents
happy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't matter how often you dab,
you're a constituent.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that you've developed that
relationship for us because I know it's
[SPEAKER_14]: not my spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fully my cross to bear.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see why it's like my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I don't see myself knowing
what you know about growing or knowing
[SPEAKER_12]: what Spence knows about blast.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just, I know about zoning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need someone like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me doing your job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of zoning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Both of you looking at me going,
thank fucking God you're here because I
[SPEAKER_12]: ain't going to fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I go to city council meetings occasionally
and I know I don't go enough, but I'm
[SPEAKER_14]: intimidated dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like going and like, hi, I'm the pot
grower.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just feels weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You get some looks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some looks.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got Jedi stared for half the session
last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude with the stars on his chest was like,
I don't like you.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a killer shirt, by the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to heavy 16 for all the goodies
that we get to give away from them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you got anybody to thank or any shout
outs for the show?
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we're only like 11 minutes in,
but.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: My beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Congrats on the wedding this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was one of the coolest weddings,
and if not the coolest wedding I've ever
[SPEAKER_14]: been to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was by far the drunkest I've ever been
at a wedding.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maddie and I got to give out live res dabs
to everybody all night.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Full on dab bar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Full on dab bar.
[SPEAKER_14]: She doesn't have a mic, but most of you
guys probably caught that from the ecto in
[SPEAKER_14]: the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had someone ask me to plan their
reception for them the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that mean we get to go?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just show up with a bunch of hash,
shit ton of beer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Maddie just grabbed the mic from
Spence.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like she's prepared.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to give a huge shout out to our
crew from NC in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: They really stepped up their game this
year and all learned how to grow some
[SPEAKER_10]: killer weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, they have some good friends to
help them learn, but our friends really
[SPEAKER_10]: stepped up and started growing some
amazing cannabis this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: They deserve a big shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good genetics go a long way also.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was kind of going to brag on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause a lot of them, you guys have passed
on iry genetic seeds to a lot of that crew
[SPEAKER_14]: and they are freaking killing it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We love to suggest iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great place to get reliable,
reliable genetics from.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I could give, unfortunately you
guys, there aren't any seeds in the prize
[SPEAKER_14]: packages because of legal reasons.
[SPEAKER_14]: These prizes are available to almost
anybody in the United States, unless
[SPEAKER_14]: you're here at the table or you're too
closely affiliated with the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, I make the fucking rules and
they can change any time I decide they
[SPEAKER_14]: change.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mad jealous for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: The prize packs are sick guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even remember where I was headed
with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, anybody can get the prizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there can't be seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_14]: There can't be seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will make a Colorado local contest where
I can put some iry seeds in there
[SPEAKER_14]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got to figure out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll just be a local thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, big shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Matty, you sound great on a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to be podcasting all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have a discussion table every
night when we take daps.
[SPEAKER_10]: We usually just have a session,
sit down and talk for an hour or two and
[SPEAKER_10]: just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, it could be on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I've said it before on the show
that your table was part of what inspired
[SPEAKER_14]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys' friend, I won't say his name,
he used to come and pick my brain for two
[SPEAKER_14]: hours at a time at your table.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I thought I should record all
this or write it down and just refer him
[SPEAKER_14]: to my recordings.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I could just bring thoughts back
that I have.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember something we were talking
about, but I don't remember the specifics.
[SPEAKER_14]: Once I'm on an older podcast that I used
to do, shout out to 719theBlox,
[SPEAKER_14]: on that podcast, we had a recording issue
and our whole recording got lost.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we decided, let's just try to redo it
and mimic it.
[SPEAKER_14]: About 10 minutes in, we're like,
this feels so fake.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no way to bring back those
thoughts in that conversation.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just gave up.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're like, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: So remaking a talk, it's not the most
legit thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've sat here and tried to make a podcast
four or five times in one night,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it just didn't work time and time.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about episode 13 or 15-ish around
that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's better when it's not forced.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't feeling it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was time to record and I just wasn't in
the mood.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I'm way more comfortable at it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So 50 episodes in on this show.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I did about 50 with another show
also.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I had some time to get comfortable.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've only been a host for 50 episodes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I've only been a host for
about 30 episodes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It took me about 20, 25 to get there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking about doing more frequent
episodes because we get more listens when
[SPEAKER_14]: they're more frequent, but I don't want to
bore people also.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to be that podcast that
disappears for three months and then comes
[SPEAKER_14]: out with the show and then comes out and
apologizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then I also don't want you to have to
listen to me four times a week like Joe
[SPEAKER_14]: Rogan, because I don't even have time to
hear all the Joe Rogan stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe Rogan's a busy dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Spence just grabbed the mic for Maddie.
[SPEAKER_14]: He smacked her with it violently.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cute violence when they do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: How about you, Spence?
[SPEAKER_14]: You got any shout outs for the year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout outs to all the people who breed
seeds and give me free seeds to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people that hook me up with the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had genetics from California and
Seattle, so shout out to all the people
[SPEAKER_04]: that have passed on genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's something that should be done now
is share the genetics for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always going to be cuts people are
going to hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you could still share at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharing is great here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just tried to step in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody had to do something here.
[SPEAKER_14]: My carb cap was clogged, so I was fucking
choking on it too.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was weak.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to clean that out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sharing is good here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: Try not to be a clone hoarder.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that's hypocritical because I'm
a breeder and I'm kind of a clone hoarder.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's going to keep your special
genetics, but everybody's got those couple
[SPEAKER_14]: that if you got something that's high in
CBD or is really good medicine,
[SPEAKER_14]: you get it out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, cuts are one thing, seeds are
another.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeds are available.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think seeds should be given out.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's part of why you guys are frustrated
with me.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not a lot of stuff at
naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because all my locals are getting it.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is obviously a markup when you go
through a dealer, a distributor,
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm skipping that markup and getting
the seeds to my locals at wholesale prices
[SPEAKER_14]: because it feels good doing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry that you guys didn't get a lot on
Nature's Green Remedies.
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole batch will probably go to you
because my locals are served up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, nine times out of 10,
that's a lot of times 90%, you would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: would go to Nature's Green Remedies and
only like 5% stays here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then all my friends are like,
where are the seeds?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, you have to go online like
everyone else and it feels rude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of our Christmas this year.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all going to take turns joking
because the dads are going around in a
[SPEAKER_14]: circle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that your shout out to you concluded
with the sharers, the people that share?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your eyes are as red as your microphone.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really, really, really, really high.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody in this room is quiet down.
[SPEAKER_14]: We showed up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone showed up right about 710 and
it's just now 810.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we took a little pre-preparing session.
[SPEAKER_14]: Adam, how about yourself, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: You got any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, you brother, like you've,
I've only been here a year and I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I met you quickly, but man, you know,
like without you, I wouldn't be in the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene that I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, you know, you fed my family,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, thanks for doing the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You man, next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pointed at Spence for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microphone can't see it, but next year
I got you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you're capable of,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
So.
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, it's good to have you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to the crew.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it's definitely, and right on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't be any place happier.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, my wife for putting up with my
wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, she, she's struggling here,
you know, but Christy, what's up Christy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be, you'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing everything for the fams.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, it's, it'll come around.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gotta be hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys moved from another state and she
doesn't have anybody in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not just look at us and we did it
two years ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: But she's not a social butterfly like us.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's really, she's kind of shyer than we
are.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand why she's having a hard
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can't just talk to people like we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just lost her job and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, it's been kind of, you know,
she, I'm proud of her for quitting her job
[SPEAKER_14]: to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_14]: She grabbed her balls and she fucking used
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been there for four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like she hasn't put up with
enough pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Christy, I pick on you, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm proud of you for quitting that job
because that shit was treating you like
[SPEAKER_14]: shit and you deserve better.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not only that, but like I said,
the other day in the, in the Facebook post
[SPEAKER_14]: that she walks the kids to school every
morning and snow, you know, she's never
[SPEAKER_14]: dealt with snow at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, props to her and everything
that she does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to all the moms out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to all the moms.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up mom?
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my mama.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody here has got a pretty good mama.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a big list of, got a big list of
shout outs I want to give here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the people that said, thanks to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes me blush.
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes me feel honored.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't be, somebody taught me that you
are the sum of the five people that you
[SPEAKER_14]: surround yourself the most on purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: Five people sitting at this table with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an honor for real.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't remember who taught me
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It may have been Cliff Ravenscraft is
where I heard it, but somebody else taught
[SPEAKER_14]: him.
[SPEAKER_14]: It might've been Michael Hyatt.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, that's the five people that you
surround yourself with the most on purpose
[SPEAKER_14]: are who you become.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are five people sitting around
me that I, I'm inspired by all of you
[SPEAKER_14]: every day, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maddie's looking at me like, you're
inspired by me?
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, your friends have a big influence on
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I completely understand that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I completely agree with that same
statement.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never really thought about it like
that before.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I was staring at you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, Hmm.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sitting here trying to think of my
five and most of them are at this table.
[SPEAKER_12]: So friends are always been my family.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course Angela would be,
if there was another person to be here
[SPEAKER_14]: that would contribute to who I have been
lately, Angela would be, if you two can,
[SPEAKER_14]: if Maddie and Spence were a person,
as we put that couple.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just Garden of Weedens.
[SPEAKER_14]: If they were Garden of Weedens,
then Angela would probably be number five.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I've got a huge, huge freaking list of
shout outs that I want to give here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking to see how much time I'm into
this episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I don't want to take like four
minutes doing shout outs, but I'm gonna.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's probably the next part here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said it first.
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela keeps me smiling and inspired.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maddie, dude, you're the first woman on
the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Spence, dude, you keep me supplied with
the dankest dads I could ever imagine
[SPEAKER_14]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_14]: I smoke a lot of hash, you guys,
and Spence keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's actually in the process of teaching
me how to make my own.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully tomorrow we'll get on that
again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: You're like family.
[SPEAKER_14]: Michael, you're like family.
[SPEAKER_14]: What up, Big Mike?
[SPEAKER_14]: White Mike sitting next to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Family.

[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, my ninja?
[SPEAKER_14]: Slop, Dizzle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Phil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Phil, we don't get to hang out enough,
bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're kind of quiet, but I know that I
think about you, that you're part of the
[SPEAKER_14]: crew over here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Adam, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_14]: You already know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, what's up?
[SPEAKER_14]: Jesse, dude, you're quiet and you're shy,
but I love having you on the show,
[SPEAKER_14]: man.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're loosening it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're becoming a great podcast guest.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: A hell of a dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that if some shit goes wrong,
I can always call you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jesse can build a house with his hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: His bare man hands.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so if some shit goes wrong,
I know I can count on him.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the beard.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the beard that does it?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the man power.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the super power.

[SPEAKER_14]: Taskless Music, his music too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy that taught me so much about
podcasting and has no idea that I even
[SPEAKER_14]: have a podcast and has never listened to
my show, will not hear this shout out,
[SPEAKER_14]: but huge shout out to Mr. Cliff
Ravenscraft, the podcast answer man.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys are trying to make a podcast,

friend, Doug Benson and also Joey Coco
[SPEAKER_14]: Diaz.
[SPEAKER_14]: And a shout out to everybody that made it
here to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of wondering if you were going
to forget him or not, but that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't going to forget Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listened to his podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their episode the other day was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Joe Rogan and Diaz?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't even listened to that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug Benson and Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little Filipino girl in between us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just like, oh, you're on a sweet
little peach there.
[SPEAKER_14]: The little Filipino girl.
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Emily Koo or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Margaret Cho?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Filipino.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just wondering how racist you're
getting.
[SPEAKER_14]: You are on a show saying that to people.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, man, I want to thank all the
listeners.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super huge shout out from my heart.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grow from my heart and I thank you from
my heart.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for listening to 50 episodes.
[SPEAKER_14]: We get like 6,000 listens on a huge
episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: When Sean comes on, we get 6,000 people to
hear this.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had no idea it was that high of a
number.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you said that earlier, I was hoping
you were going to mention it now because I
[SPEAKER_10]: had no idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you knew what my guess was,
it was nothing close to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can tell me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought maybe like 1,500.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think about the fact that it's the
web.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody can listen to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sent print ads to Nature's Green
Remedies.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so everybody that bought seeds for
like three months got my ad in the mail.
[SPEAKER_14]: With their seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was very smart of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's around the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as I get the new logo figured out
and everything, I plan on printing up a
[SPEAKER_14]: new logo and bombing the world with new
newsletter ads and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll drop them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder what our craziest location
listener is.
[SPEAKER_14]: I could probably tell you by looking at
the logistics on my website.
[SPEAKER_14]: It tells me where, yeah, I could see where
everybody's IP address is.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is that people cheat on
their IP addresses because they can't be
[SPEAKER_14]: looking at certain shit where they're
from.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they got to go in somewhere else and
then come back to your site.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're listened to in like Prague and
Russia and places where they don't even
[SPEAKER_14]: speak English.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any time I've done any kind of social
media video chat, I've always pumped that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've told Mike before, those are my
listens.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to all the people on Bong TV.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a nice little group that I hang out
with there on Bong TV, the Snowdener Army.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dough, what up bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we've been arguing, but it's a
friendly argument.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Dough, Tripp.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't list them all.
[SPEAKER_14]: I forget people's D's.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Bong TV.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that dude with the dreadlocks?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's me, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jen Dredd.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jen Dredd 420.
[SPEAKER_14]: The other guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's General Dredd.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out dude with the other dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a couple of guys on with dreads
lately.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know which one I'm talking about
though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I was getting at is that I love
all the listeners and to show that
[SPEAKER_14]: appreciation, we've got some killer prize
packages and we want to give them away.
[SPEAKER_14]: We sat around here for a few minutes
trying to think about ways to give them
[SPEAKER_14]: away.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will post pictures and I'll read the
prize packs here in a minute, but I want
[SPEAKER_14]: to tell you first to keep you excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will post pictures of the prize packages
on Instagram and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: The prize packages, there'll be individual
prizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: The prizes that are on Facebook are only
there on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: The prizes that are on Instagram are only
available on Instagram so that people that
[SPEAKER_14]: are on different social medias have
options to get in on this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll post pictures on whichever side I'm
posting it on.
[SPEAKER_14]: What you have to do is follow on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to follow, where is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to follow Irish genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to follow high grow Pueblo and
you have to follow Garden of Weedon on
[SPEAKER_14]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to be in the Instagram
contest, you have to follow those people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you have to comment on a photo of the
prize package that you want because I
[SPEAKER_14]: don't want you, if you want a t-shirt,
don't like comment on the nutrient
[SPEAKER_14]: packages because there are nutrient
packages and shit that I want those to go
[SPEAKER_14]: to people that are going to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want a nutrient package,
comment on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want a t-shirt, comment on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want the sweet ass pendant that
Maddie and Spence brought, comment on that
[SPEAKER_14]: so that we can give these prizes to people
that want them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Comment on the prize that you want using
hashtag grow from your heart giveaway on
[SPEAKER_14]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then comment on that picture and tell me
why you think you should win that prize.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got three things to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to follow three people.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to comment using a hashtag,
using hashtag grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_14]: giveaway.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you've got to put in a little message
there and tell me why you think you should
[SPEAKER_14]: win that specific prize.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can enter once on each picture,
and that includes Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do all of the contests once.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't enter, don't leave two comments on
the same picture.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll probably delete both of your comments
at that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just trying to keep it fair.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't want a bunch of people
spamming the shit out of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I make all the rules as they're going.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try to be as fair as
possible, but I do have the right to
[SPEAKER_14]: change the rules if I feel like you
cheated or you're being a douche.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can just cock block you.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hold that heavy ban hammer in every
single prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would... There are great prizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Jesse and Hygro killed it when they
showed up with... They brought four killer
[SPEAKER_14]: bags.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me read you what's in this bag.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the big... I'll go from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_14]: The smaller prizes are from our good
friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be one Highly Educated T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a size extra large, and there is one
I read genetics sticker pack in there,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is a license plate sticker,
a regular logo sticker, and an I Heart Dab
[SPEAKER_14]: sticker.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the Highly Educated prize pack.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are four I read genetics t-shirts
and sticker packs available.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm writing down sticker pack on there
because I didn't put that part on the
[SPEAKER_14]: start.
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be four I read genetics t-shirts
and sticker packs available.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a variety of sizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are three black and one white.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll list them all on social media sites.
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be probably two will land on
Facebook, two on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll list those up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got four options.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go ahead and add... There are
two hat pins, two Iri hat pins,
[SPEAKER_14]: one for IG and one for Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of cool ass prizes now.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just going nuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Getting even better.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm only shipping this shit to the United
States, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not shipping this stuff out of
America.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to be in the United States of
America.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you win these prizes and you want to
pay for the shipping and you're in France
[SPEAKER_14]: or wherever, or else out of the country,
you can pay for the shipping and I'll mail
[SPEAKER_14]: it to you, but it's already going to be
expensive enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: For that grand prize, it's going to be
like 40 bucks, even if it goes to Denver.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's coming out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to... I mean, everybody threw
down sweet prizes, so I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out for Jeff for paying for the
shipping.
[SPEAKER_14]: What you brought way outshines my shipping
costs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Hygro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys rule.
[SPEAKER_14]: Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a prize package from the lovely
folks at Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: What size was it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Extra large?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Extra large T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a sticker, a Garden of Weedon
sticker and a cool ass pendee.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's made by the real ghost cat glass
artist.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_14]: I told them that it wasn't making it to
the prize pack and they looked at me like
[SPEAKER_14]: I was a dick and told me I had to give it
away.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you guys are lucky you did now.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are kind of the smaller prizes,
which aren't even that small.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got T-shirts and sticker packs.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a pendee.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a sticker and a shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got hat pins.
[SPEAKER_14]: So here's where we're getting fancy.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are three of these available.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a big one of those sweet tote bags
like you get at all the events.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bunch of Heavy 16 nutrients,
like a Heavy 16 nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Heavy 16.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll grow some heavy herb with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bottle of Plant Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bottle of Taproot.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some stickers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's probably a Humboldt
Hempwick and maybe some random shit in
[SPEAKER_14]: there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a little bit of swag in that bag.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are three of those.
[SPEAKER_11]: Little Nanolux flashlight.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Little Nanolux.
[SPEAKER_14]: A green flashlight for your grow room.
[SPEAKER_14]: The green light won't bug your plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those have been a favorite around the
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the job site.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the grand prize brought to us
again.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to mention Hygro Indoor Growing
Supplies in Pueblo and Denver.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mention the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll get sweet deals.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has donated
a bag of Grokashi, a bag of OGT,
[SPEAKER_14]: a big bunch of Heavy 16 nutrients,
a big bottle of Plant Catalyst,
[SPEAKER_14]: a bottle of Taproot.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lighter, some stickers.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a Probiotic Farmers Alliance
button.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a Gage Green Genetics button.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a Bronco t-shirt with some other
stuff on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that Bronco logo is used
with proper licensing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a house and garden t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's that shirt in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's probably stickers and
there's going to be other random stuff in
[SPEAKER_14]: that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is our big super number one bonus
prize pack.
[SPEAKER_14]: That Grokashi is going to improve your
grow by a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_14]: That OGT is going to improve your grow a
whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, all of that will make
you into a damn near great gardener.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: All you need now is a good pack of seeds
and some soil and a good light and you'll
[SPEAKER_14]: be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Decent, good living soil and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do it right.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll put you through the first one at
least.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really nice to try some new products
also.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll teach you, damn, whatever I did
that time, I need to do it again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually got a sample pack of that Heavy
16 and I will use it on something really
[SPEAKER_14]: soon.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got so many projects coming up that
I've started another perpetual cycle
[SPEAKER_14]: instead of doing large rooms all at once.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a perpetual and that gives me
more options to run different newts.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I really like the perpetual better.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just keeps me going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It keeps me, I don't know, it seems like I
get stagnant when I just have a long grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So guys, get in on these prize packages.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here are the rules again.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to take pictures of every prize
package and I will try to show everything
[SPEAKER_14]: that's in the package in a nice little
pile.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to take me a minute to get all
these up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will post the pictures to Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will post some of the pictures to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: What you've got to do is go and follow,
oh yeah, I didn't say who you had to
[SPEAKER_14]: follow on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to follow the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to follow Hygro and or Growing
Supplies and you have to follow the Garden
[SPEAKER_14]: of Weedon on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to comment using hashtag grow
from your heart and you have to tell me
[SPEAKER_14]: why you should win the prizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will post the pictures on the
iRegenetics on Instagram and the Grow From
[SPEAKER_14]: Your Heart podcast on Facebook is where
you'll find these pictures.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?
[SPEAKER_14]: I said that right, right everyone?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just making sure I'm not fucking
anything up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want everybody to be on the same
page as me because my notes are really
[SPEAKER_14]: scattered on this page.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would imagine all this information
will be in the post with the picture.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll put the rules there too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check the sizes for the shirts,
folks.
[SPEAKER_12]: We made sure to get a selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the kind of stuff I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_12]: So check the photo that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't comment on the extra small shirt
when you want the extra large shirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The extra medium.
[SPEAKER_12]: The extra medium.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll look good on you.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll look good on you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you wear?
[SPEAKER_14]: Tall and skinny?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, you look funny in a medium.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd be like a little mini halter top on
you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Spence is like six, four, six,
five.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the curse of the tall guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're also the skinny guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're doubly bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember one time I went to,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Big and tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those thinking I could get some
just regular tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, you got to be like size 40 and
tall at the same time.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could fit in one palette that you got
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's big and not big, comma.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it should be.
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot to do a shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_14]: They changed the game this year a little
bit for a few people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got indoor, outdoor tree trunks grown
inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen the pictures.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check out Spence's Instagram.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sure you do.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're trying to win some prizes,
you're going to have to like some stuff on
[SPEAKER_14]: Spence's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're listening to this show,
these follows, if you aren't already,
[SPEAKER_12]: you will enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen to episode 50.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that needs to be a rule.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not applicable to, you know,
at this moment, but once it's on social
[SPEAKER_11]: media.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're definitely, if they want to know
all the rules, they probably listen to
[SPEAKER_14]: number 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please just listen to the podcast guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell your friends.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're getting, we're definitely hitting
4,000 listens on almost every episode,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: The better episodes get 6,000.
[SPEAKER_14]: The standouts are getting 5,000 listens.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some that are still like the
episodes with just me.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't, nobody listens.
[SPEAKER_14]: They listen to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can see on the website, if you
listen like for 40 minutes of the episode
[SPEAKER_14]: or 40% of the episode, it shows me how far
you drop out and people just get tired of
[SPEAKER_14]: me rambling by myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: But tell your friends about the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: If all 5,000 of my listeners told one per
told two people about the show,
[SPEAKER_14]: cause one person's going to ignore you and
one person might listen.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd probably get me at least another
thousand listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcasting is still kind of new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's catching on very quickly,
but you tell people, Hey, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you listen to podcasts?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what's a podcast?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or they're like, yeah, I do, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: What shows are you jamming up?
[SPEAKER_14]: They either know or they don't.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you tell people, when more people
listen, it moves my show up in the ranks
[SPEAKER_14]: in Stitcher and in iTunes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then that shows, it makes it available
to more people.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just see it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then more people grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just more better, mow better weed all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell your dealer to listen to the show.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell whoever's responsible for growing
your cannabis to listen to the Grow From
[SPEAKER_14]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe we can get you some better weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: No mids.
[SPEAKER_14]: No mids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell people all the time, all the time
about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have kind of gotten way off topic
on the past few episodes because we had
[SPEAKER_14]: Christmas and New Year's and then I was
sick as shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And these guys came over and did a rescue
episode for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's even out yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that hasn't been posted as of this
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know how many listens that got,
but it was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: The last episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stoners that are ahead of schedule.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we are going to get back onto the
track of doing those great episodes where
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a lot of grow lessons and a lot of
great guests.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are going to learn more shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just going to be my high ass
rambling.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've actually got the next like 10
episodes kind of outlined.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what the topics are going to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: I could scroll through my phone and read
off points, but I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Learning is what 2015 is all about.
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that Adam said that that was not
my motto at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: So y'all going to learn from Adam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not from me.
[SPEAKER_14]: 44.
44.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get in on those contests, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of the smaller prizes,
but it's so dope.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that for me, Miss Maddy?
[SPEAKER_14]: Miss Maddy just scooped me up.
[SPEAKER_14]: What screen did you just give me?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_14]: You are close to that mic.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody's got to talk while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go for it, Adam.
[SPEAKER_14]: You always have a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we learned today that getting hit in
the face with the ball pisses people off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll survive, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's a total accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really wanted to come, you know,
tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The table is really full.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's crowded.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seat's taken.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not us being a dick.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's literally you'd have to... Mike
and Jesse are kind of cuddling.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike and Jesse are pretty damn close to
each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any more microphones.
[SPEAKER_11]: The third time I hit him in the face with
the ball was totally an accident.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was clearly an accident and it was
clearly the straw that broke.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think taking out of that job site as
fast as you can with all wheels spinning
[SPEAKER_12]: towards that very, very thin and
steel-framed gate is just going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: something we all do at least twice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like you guys have fun at work.
[SPEAKER_14]: We do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Zero fun is allowed at work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like you're breaking rules.
[SPEAKER_12]: When a bunch of males of the same age are
left to just stand around for... Sounds
[SPEAKER_12]: like a National Geographic description.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bizarre shit happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: That dab just made my face kind of...
Today it was T-ball that do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: It made my eyes get... Injuries and
property damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the kind of fun of the day,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been made fun of a couple times,
but I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who, you?
[SPEAKER_14]: They make fun of you at work?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun here.
[SPEAKER_14]: These guys didn't work together until
recently.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's partly my fault that these
guys all kind of built a construction
[SPEAKER_14]: company together on accident.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's fun to see all my bros just
hanging out talking about what they did
[SPEAKER_14]: because before they were all off doing
their own separate shit and now they all
[SPEAKER_14]: have a good story together.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes for interesting conversations
sometimes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Adam said that 2015 is the year of
learning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody else have something that 2015
is for them?
[SPEAKER_14]: The year of what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cashing in, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew that answer.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like some of my really hard work to
pay off and it will.
[SPEAKER_14]: It will.
[SPEAKER_14]: Faux show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was thinking that 2014 is the year of
getting the construction and the
[SPEAKER_12]: foundation in.
[SPEAKER_12]: 2015 is actually seeing some shit succeed
and get finished.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: I finally got hired on at a large
facility, so I've got over 200 lights to
[SPEAKER_14]: work with now.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of what my year is going to be
about.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have fun with that,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Blowing it up, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Blowing it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get more shirts made.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get them on the shelves at the spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get more hoodies made.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get them on the shelves at the spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some hats.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I'm glad you said it because Robert,
if you're listening to this episode,
[SPEAKER_14]: bro, some hats are necessary.
[SPEAKER_14]: We need spot hats and we need iReGenetics
grassroots hats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might as well call grassroots right there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will prepay for my hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a poor motherfucker and I will give
you $40 out of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to prepay for my hat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Grassroots Colorado, Grassroots
California, Ruga, Ryan, if you're
[SPEAKER_14]: listening to this show, brother,
I would love a sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do ads for a year in exchange for
iReGenetics hats.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got an audience of 5,000 listeners,
weekly episodes.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 52 episodes a year, at least,
with 5,000 people here in your ads.
[SPEAKER_14]: This podcast is brought to you by our good
friends at Grassroots California.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're looking for a dope ass hat,
please go further.
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop in at something something Larimer in
Denver and pick yourself up a badass
[SPEAKER_14]: grassroots hat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 22 samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he already knows the address.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a grassroots hat on right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got about 10 more on the shelf
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to my friend Ashley who handmade
my hat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck y'all.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just can't decide which grassroots hat I
like the most, so I just keep buying the
[SPEAKER_14]: new fresh one that I see.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check out Maddie's Purple Forever
Flowering grassroots hat.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is fresh, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: That purple is purple and baby blue.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got an iRe hat pin on there to make it
official.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I got iRe hat pin on here.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, most of my hats have it, but this
one's already got the Colorado flag on
[SPEAKER_14]: there enough, so I don't put that on
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: LightDepth.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the coolest websites I've
ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't even pay for that, but shout
out to Forever Flowering Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, if you're poor and broke,
don't even try.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have one on, folks.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you got an advanced grow and you're
looking for a nice outdoor greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_14]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the way
to go if you can.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll take your shit to the next level.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to sell one for you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get at me.
[SPEAKER_14]: You go on vacation and put plants in the
shitbag and have killer plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get at me for my efforts.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got to name your company so we can
start shouting it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, big shout out to Jesse's Grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Grammy Gatsby?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll build that shit for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw those pictures.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll get to hang out then.
[SPEAKER_14]: Me and Gatsby have relayed messages five
or six times, and it's like, it's your
[SPEAKER_14]: turn to come see me, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never said that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come to the Prebs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come to the Prebs.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get garden weed, turpax,
and the Hunt on the show all at once.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come straight to us and we'll protect you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, come on down, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Hunt can take care of himself.
[SPEAKER_14]: He ain't worried about you.
[SPEAKER_14]: It ain't that bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a dangerous city in Colorado,
though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that funny, though?
[SPEAKER_14]: I live here with my kids every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen a damn bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually kind of love this place.
[SPEAKER_14]: People are like, why do you still live
there?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, dude, I didn't grow up here,
but I became who I am here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like I kind of owe it to this
town to stay here and be who I am and
[SPEAKER_14]: support the movement here and be part of
this scene here.
[SPEAKER_14]: How many times have we defended it in
Denver?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we beat the shit out of the
people that we're talking shit about.
[SPEAKER_14]: We took all their money and their Nikes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably one of the least violent people I
know.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've gone almost 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: We should put about another 10 minutes
into this show.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody got anything smart ass or great to
say?
[SPEAKER_14]: What are some of your favorite moments
we've had on this podcast so far?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, remember that night we sat here,
we talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_14]: We sat here, you sat across the table from
me and we tried to do a show for like
[SPEAKER_14]: three hours.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if it was the dabs or if
it was just the unfocusedness of the
[SPEAKER_03]: group.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there was no podcast to be had
that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the middle of the podcast, he just
walks up in the room, starts yelling and
[SPEAKER_03]: screaming and it was weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it didn't really happen, but it kind of
really did happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was definitely a funny moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a recording error to where I didn't
delete one of the prerecorded tracks from
[SPEAKER_14]: another recording session.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when he came around to that,
that recording dropped into while we were
[SPEAKER_14]: talking.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, cause the guy goes,
Hey, it's me, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_14]: And just starts talking.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're like, but you're not even in the
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: How the hell did you just do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Jeff was a ventriloquist at that
point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wow, this is really weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I need to go home, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like some four track shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: A moment that I really, really remember is
when I ate the 350 milligram edible on the
[SPEAKER_14]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, I don't remember the whole
hour show, but I kind of remember doing
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sat here holding onto my chair,
just tapping my feet as hard as I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm flying right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things, those things you do not want
to come to Colorado and eat.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be brownie, but that's 350
milligrams of sit the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the damn label.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys come to Colorado and eat
edibles, be careful, please.
[SPEAKER_14]: Luckily that's a medical only,
but you know, yeah, I think they can only
[SPEAKER_14]: sell a hundred gram edibles at the rec
side now.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the rule.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what Incredibles are?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're a hundred.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, you can buy like seven of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still Maureen Dowd front.
[SPEAKER_12]: 70 of them, I don't remember.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it's read the fucking label.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that's what, that was the big lesson
of 2014 is what happens if you legalize
[SPEAKER_12]: wheat?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, as it turns out, people don't read
labels for fucking anything ever.
[SPEAKER_12]: We just assume that- People that don't
even take pot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like they don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well no, if you think about it,
do y'all remember the chips that gave you
[SPEAKER_12]: anal leakage?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like they were looking for fat free and it
made your asshole drip.
[SPEAKER_12]: That had to be on the front of the bag and
they still sold everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's because people don't read labels.
[SPEAKER_12]: And with edibles that leaves you to
hugging a pair of weird jeans in a hotel
[SPEAKER_12]: room and then writing about it for the New
York times or Ralphie May trying not to
[SPEAKER_12]: shit himself on screen.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know the meme with the little black
kid that always says, you mean to tell me
[SPEAKER_14]: that blah, blah, blah, and blah,
blah, blah, but you mean to tell me there
[SPEAKER_14]: was some fucking chips that caused anal
leakage and people were still buying it?
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot that y'all were probably on two
fish tour when this hit the shelves
[SPEAKER_12]: because it's the, those timelines line up,
but Olestra I think was the special oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: They found a special oil and you could eat
chips that you didn't get any calories
[SPEAKER_12]: from.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your butt was leaking.
[SPEAKER_12]: All that fat your body didn't absorb was
dripping out your ass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will pass.
[SPEAKER_14]: America was all about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need a snack.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to eat on the toilet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesse's a fellow to eat anything at the
gas station kid.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what the fuck's up.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I remember making fun of my cousin for
eating those.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember reading the package.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's right on the front of the bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: May cause anal leakage.
[SPEAKER_12]: It said anal on the front of a bag of
chips and they still sold all over the
[SPEAKER_12]: country.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is definitely a record time for the
word anal being sold.
[SPEAKER_12]: People just don't even see it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They think 350 milligrams, huh?
[SPEAKER_12]: That seems like a lot for a fun size
Snickers edible.
[SPEAKER_12]: They chew that shit back and 20 minutes
later, they think they're in space.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're really just sitting in the hot tub
of their hotel room.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just plus splashing three inches of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 to 45 minutes isn't enough time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, give it two or three hours.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give it some time to kick it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got to be broken down and processed
into your blood and it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bad Ralphie, bad Ralphie.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every person is different.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Spencer, are you going to enter any
contests in 2015?
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to travel to Oregon and Seattle
again this year and go enter up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe California.
[SPEAKER_04]: High times cannabis cups?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe what next?
[SPEAKER_04]: When is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Next November again or something like
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe some.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to get out and kind of... The
best thing about going to cups is it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like vacation, but there's weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to worry about trying to
find weed because you're going to a weed
[SPEAKER_04]: event.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys got your Denver cannabis cup
tickets yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know what we're doing yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if I want to buy tickets
or go through the vending route.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got my three day pass.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just working on booking a hotel room.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've actually got a ticket to see Doug
Benson on 420 at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_14]: Booker house.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just roll solo and just do the backpack
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get in the car and leave when I want,
go where I want.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just going to be me doing the backpack in
the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as I get extra money.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've gone with the crew of people and I've
gone by myself and it's easier for me to
[SPEAKER_14]: just go and meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I like going... I don't know,
I like going with the crew, but I like to,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially me when I'm trying to like talk
to people it's kind of hard having 15
[SPEAKER_04]: people when you're trying to all go talk
to people.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys get tired of hanging out with me
at the cannabis cup because I'm not even
[SPEAKER_14]: trying to be egotistical, but people walk
up and want to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: They know who I am.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're hanging out with me,
you're just hanging out by yourself pretty
[SPEAKER_14]: much.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I roll solo, just go by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do a lot of shit by yourself.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have to say, Hey Mike,
do you want to do this?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you hungry, Mike?
[SPEAKER_12]: These events are so crowded and so well
attended.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to picture one of you
walking with like 15, I mean, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_12]: call them ducklings.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not intended as insulting as that
sounds, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw it last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Trying to walk down the aisle like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you got to lose all your ducklings.
[SPEAKER_12]: You end up at the end of the road going,
well, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got business to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the big thing for me this year
is business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to take care of business.
[SPEAKER_04]: No more playing games and being nice and
none of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to come out and take some cake.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be trying to talk to somebody like
hanging out with Mila and then the people
[SPEAKER_14]: with me don't even know who Mila is.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have no clue who she is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know who that was?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, no, I'm fucking bored.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, dude, that was, you should have got
in on that conversation.
[SPEAKER_14]: You should have said, hello.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You should have got your picture taken.
[SPEAKER_14]: You should have gave her a hug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give her some oil or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much learned quickly that when
you're excited, I should be excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you take me places, when you're
pumped that yeah, there's something I
[SPEAKER_03]: should be paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if I don't understand right now,
it'll probably be explained later.
[SPEAKER_12]: With this guy, even lunch can be a mild
adventure where famous people just appear.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just got to accept it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's bizarre.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just got to know how to put yourself
in the position and line yourself up to
[SPEAKER_14]: meet the people you want to meet without
being creepy and realize they're just
[SPEAKER_14]: fucking people too.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you open with the right lines,
they're just humans too.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they realize that you're not a stalker
and they want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am nobody perfect and I'm sure I'm not
everybody's cup of tea, but I'm a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: dude that tells the truth most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt giddy when DNA genetics walked up
to me and shook my hand because they
[SPEAKER_14]: recognized me and my logo from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like, Hey, I know who you are,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said, what's up to me and gave me
props for my work.
[SPEAKER_14]: They kind of put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a hot nail.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody talk while I dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you got a great email set up for
him from, you know, and shout out for
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use that thing every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used it right before the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, just shout out to the G-Nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that earlier than I forgot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to G.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, the G-Nail is a beautiful
invention.
[SPEAKER_14]: These dabs are available that are on the
table.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody can dab out of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to be stashed, but here go
for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those early podcasts might not
have been put together at 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't tell everybody those happened to
like sunrise and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so much more comfortable on a mic now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just swing the mic in front of me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even edit the shows anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_14]: Podcast time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel better putting some of me into the
show instead of just being all
[SPEAKER_14]: information.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I've made a lot of friends
now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And from listening to, I listened to
Nerdist and I listened to Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now when I see those guys,
like I saw Nerdist, Chris Hardwick at Red
[SPEAKER_14]: Rocks and was like watching one of my
friends achieve a goal.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel like maybe my listeners feel
like I'm one of their buddies,
[SPEAKER_14]: especially the people that interact with
me on Twitter and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I'm their friends.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like if I met Mr. Omnio, he lives in the
UK.
[SPEAKER_14]: If he showed up, he'd bring the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_14]: He'd come in and take dabs and hang out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I'd make a cup of yerba mate and
we'd chill out and he'd be my bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just because I have a podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that guy's my friend now from that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fred Garvin would probably show up and
come take dabs.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just killed Mike with the dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: There he goes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd really like for you to get Addison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was on show number two.
[SPEAKER_14]: Addison DeMora.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get him back.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been asking and asking and asking.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Addison.
[SPEAKER_14]: I should have given a shout out to that
guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: Addison, Big D, Hunt, all the Denver crew,
Naked T.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out, shout out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the most horrific thing
ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know he's been beating me up with the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Matty's about to blast Spence's nanny
beard slash and dreadlock mess.
[SPEAKER_10]: Torch to the dome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Torch to the dome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody should hold on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to yell you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Mike, are you alive?
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike is alive, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: We did not kill him.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very borderline, but he made it.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody else have anything to say?
[SPEAKER_14]: We're down to two minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go down to a minute.
[SPEAKER_14]: Try to keep this about an hour.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do your stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do your stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Alive and well, people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: We did not kill Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've said it a couple of times,
but I sincerely want to thank all you guys
[SPEAKER_14]: for coming to the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are, Adam's made jokes about A
team and B team and shit, but this is my
[SPEAKER_14]: crew right here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know if something went wrong in my life,
this would be the first five people I
[SPEAKER_14]: could call to help me out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate everything you guys
taught me this year and all together
[SPEAKER_10]: throughout the times that I've known you,
Jeff, especially you taught me a lot since
[SPEAKER_10]: I moved here from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I feel like I'm from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome home.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't realize I taught you so much.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't realize you absorbed so much of
what I taught you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I learned from you guys too.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just me teaching you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I come and parrot a lot of shit that
Spence says just in my own language.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: I learn shit from you guys every day.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you guys too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: That goes for both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Sean and even Clint and Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike's taught me grow shit on accident.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not just refreshing your mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not everything about growing is about
growing.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's simple shit in your grow room that
Mike may go, why has that turned that way?
[SPEAKER_14]: If you turn that way, you'd get better
airflow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just giving random examples.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's like physics and shit to be done
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Tony also.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I skipped that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: He keeps the website going.
[SPEAKER_14]: He keeps the feed going.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's one of the, when I said physics,
I thought of Tony right away.
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows about airflow and a lot of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: So because even if your friends aren't the
best growers, you can learn accidentally
[SPEAKER_14]: about HVAC.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can learn plumbing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like all that shit comes in handy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So don't ever take anybody for granted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Vaughn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Scott.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Scott.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll never listen to this probably,
but they at least deserve the big love.
[SPEAKER_12]: I learned a drywall already this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a learning shit, douche bag,
way to fucking name it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big shout out to Ralph who taught me how
to drywall.
[SPEAKER_03]: 44's method of learning will get you far
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yo Fish, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was dissing you on the other show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he's still different.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also shout out to Dreadful J.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't given her a shout out in a
while.
[SPEAKER_14]: She listens.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out for impact resistant glasses.
[SPEAKER_14]: This show should just be called episode 50
mad shout outs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Earlier when you were shouting out,
she reminded me of 40 ounces to freedom.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of what I was going for,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your mom called.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said, take a nap.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_14]: That dude don't know the goddamn thing
about Miami.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll try to put some music in the
background of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put that music in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if you can find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get sued, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I won't get sued,
but iTunes will take it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never taken down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're telling me you can't go down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a dub version somehow of every single
instrument.
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in the day, I used to play like
Marlon Asher and popular reggae and they
[SPEAKER_14]: never flagged any of my shows,
but I only had like a hundred listens back
[SPEAKER_14]: then, so nobody even noticed.
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit's funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: You mean that song?
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job, Barney Stinson.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for listening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise the episodes are going to get
better.
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise the guests are going to stay
high caliber.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody that's here is just hi.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now he's a smart ass after that dab you
took.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody that's here is invited back
whenever they'd like to be back.
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise I'll have everybody here again.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do great shows.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to get some more ladies on the
show.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's harder to get ladies on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: There aren't as many ladies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys have more shit to talk about because
we're kind of egoists.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: You hang out with a bunch of bad ass
dudes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a squad of guys around me all the
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw that picture you posted,
like all these dudes protect me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah, we all have your back,
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm standing in the back there with a big
old smile.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I got her back forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a Merry Christmas picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know there's other growers like
in the scene and Instagram and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but you're the only one here
locally that's at least known for
[SPEAKER_03]: producing killer stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So ladies that want to be on the podcast
and have something to contribute about
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's your opinion, your view.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know very, very few female growers that
I have a lot of respect for, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_10]: some will step up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come be on the show if you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are in Pueblo, Colorado on the south
side and all you got to do is send me an
[SPEAKER_14]: email.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can call me.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can Facebook me.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on Instagram at iregenetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a big old dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Spencer just gave me a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he got up and left and he did it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He took off somewhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't know about no part of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: The email is in the other room turned on
so that could be where he went.
[SPEAKER_14]: There wasn't any room on the table for the
email tonight with all the gear.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was such a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: It started coming out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called an angry dragon, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the terminology.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: On that note, we're going to wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody that came, everybody that's
listening, everyone that downloads the
[SPEAKER_14]: show, everyone that contributes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, also a little bit of pandering.
[SPEAKER_14]: I added, we added, Tony technically added
at the request of myself, a donate button
[SPEAKER_14]: on the iregenetics website.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go to iregenetics.com, find the
grow from your heart podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a donate button at the top.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you feel like this show was worth a
couple of bucks and you want to make a
[SPEAKER_14]: slight contribution, you can make a
donation to the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will thank you on the show if you'd like
me to, or you can tell me not to say your
[SPEAKER_14]: name.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not begging for money, but a couple of
people said that if I had the donation
[SPEAKER_14]: button, they would throw donations in
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And why not take a donation if someone's
trying to offer it?
[SPEAKER_10]: You put so much of your time and effort
into this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You deserve it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And not only that, but you can put it back
into the podcast for necessary equipment.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can potentially have more giveaways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also put it as an anonymous so you
don't even need to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just three bucks that came from
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I learned about something else
that I may try to do in the future.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called a money bomb is what this guy
called it.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you listen to a lot of podcasts,
you may already know about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to tell you too much about
this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't paid too much attention to how
to do it, but it sounds like a great idea
[SPEAKER_14]: to where it will give me money to give
away to my listeners and also help fund
[SPEAKER_14]: the podcast a little.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like Maddie said, I do put some time
into this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody here spent about an hour with me
before we even recorded putting this show
[SPEAKER_12]: together.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was thinking while you were talking,
what it would cost to get all of us in a
[SPEAKER_12]: room, say for like a two hour consultation
with the business.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's in the thousands.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm expensive for that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: To get all of us at the table is upfront
and honest as we are with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sitting here thinking about the
content over the last 50 episodes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you go back and cherry pick,
say like the outdoor grown lesson episodes
[SPEAKER_12]: or in the growing and curing and
harvesting episodes, that's like job
[SPEAKER_12]: training.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you pay attention and take notes,
you can fully have a career based on that
[SPEAKER_12]: information.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you put a couple of years of practice
into it and do your own independent
[SPEAKER_12]: research, that's the foundation.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like a bachelor's degree in weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not even fucking around a little,
that's legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse's outdoor lessons this year
basically walked me through my outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there was, there was dry
and cure episodes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got your weed dried and cured.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Sean came and talked to you about
organics and taught you how to not go buy
[SPEAKER_14]: bottled nutrients anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, just yesterday I mixed up Gro
Kashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, look out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So here for a year of mixing Gro Kashi.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to get an extract artist on here
that will teach us how to make hash,
[SPEAKER_14]: but at the same time that's risky because
we can't teach you how to open blast
[SPEAKER_14]: because that's not legit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then nobody wants to give away their
clothes.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can sit around and tell you how a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll get someone to come teach us
how to make water hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get Fred Morris or somebody to come
teach you how to make water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very good idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fred Morris, if you listen to the show,
hit me up, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want you to come on and teach us how to
make water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, across the table there doesn't
know, knows quite a bit about water hash
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's keeping his head down, but you know,
he also knows who Fred Morris is.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he knows why I'm saying Fred Morris.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm not trying to call you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that, you know,
I've smoked it and it was, it was very
[SPEAKER_02]: impressive, you know, and maybe I haven't
had that much bubble hash, but I do all
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence got ADD.
[SPEAKER_14]: He had to go charge his phone.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too high, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't give him that many dads for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just how we roll.
[SPEAKER_10]: All he's thinking about is damn Amy
Donuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh dude, it's nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: They closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they closed at seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: They closed at seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have so stopped, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I thought I said it's nine.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're closed.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you told me the other day they closed
at seven.
[SPEAKER_14]: I better hurry up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they closed at seven.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nine and they are closed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never had to go to a donut place and
be like nothing with bacon on it,
[SPEAKER_14]: please.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like that's weird for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the vanilla cheesecake ones that you
like so much?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's absolutely my favorite.
[SPEAKER_10]: Vanilla cheesecake is top notch.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Elvis is good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come get some Amy's Donuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy Pueblo Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: The green chili one is banging.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's wrap up this show you

[SPEAKER_14]: Spence is packing up.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's stretching.
[SPEAKER_14]: You going to the gym after this,
bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to leave me.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like he's about to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's finish this up before Maddie has to

made.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got to do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working on another company also so
that I've got multiple logos to work with,
[SPEAKER_14]: but don't worry, Bender, I appreciate your
logo and I need it all.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also keep it coming, but I've got another
idea that I want to use.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been home to talk to him.

[SPEAKER_14]: Starved.

[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for good for listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check us out on episode 51.
[SPEAKER_14]: Until then, take a fat dab and give your
mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, I'm excited because across the table
from me is one of my favorite people on
[SPEAKER_14]: this planet.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said she did not want to be on the
podcast and then I talked her into it and
[SPEAKER_14]: Miss Angela is here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can say hello now.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're so adorable.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't supposed to say anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said she wanted to come hang out and
not talk, but I put a mic in her face and
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get her talking because she's
a talkative chick.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's not feeling super well today.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I rescued her from work.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to give her some medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's going to smoke some CBD herb on the
show and we're going to kind of see if it
[SPEAKER_14]: makes her feel better while she's here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think she took one hit off that bull and
she started to smile a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: So dude, thanks for coming, Angela.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Over here to my left is this obnoxious
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got Clint Stewart.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tall Clint is back.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Obnoxious already.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's how we like you, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the show obnoxious when you're
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to lively up.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's, she's mellow over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that the comments on the board is like,
you know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything but Clint.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, people, uh, people like you because
not everybody is a cannabis expert.
[SPEAKER_14]: And since, uh, you're the new guy,
you remind me to quit doing wheelies and
[SPEAKER_14]: to just ride with both wheels on the
ground and teach you guys how to get your
[SPEAKER_14]: balance and go straight before we start
doing backflips and shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every once in a while you can do like a
one-hander, but like, let us, let us,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, try to catch up to where you're at.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause you're at a level, what 50 and I'm
at a level negative one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to call you negative
anything, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did, uh, I did see you take two,
hits off of a joint last night.
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the whole car ride home,
you were higher than giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we get that far, I want to say a
big thanks to, uh, Coup dog cat and the
[SPEAKER_14]: mystic roots band.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause they allow me to play all their
music on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got to say thanks to that all the
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to do two quick ads before we
get into the show.

[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to talk about Ari Shaffir.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've introduced everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, so last night, my buddy Clint,
well, about a month ago, my buddy Clint
[SPEAKER_14]: sent me a text message and said,
Ari Shaffir comedy works January 30th.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, fuck yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, Clint and I have barely had time
to even talk to each other over the past
[SPEAKER_14]: month.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been four or five text messages.
[SPEAKER_14]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy new year.
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then is Ari still happening?
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like the most recent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, uh, I'm so glad when he was like,
fuck yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, all right, be at my house
at four and we'll do this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: My problem is it's, it's not Jeff.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I'm, I just work too much.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's both of us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeff's busy too, but you know,
it's just, I'm a, I'm a steel worker.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm, I'm there all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And dude, you work a week days,
a week of days, and then a week of nights.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would just drive my body insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do a 12 hour shifts Monday through
Friday, seven to seven.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, uh, so you're doing AM to PM.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the next week you do PM to AM and
then back and back and back.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, you know, so you're just constantly
trying to catch up on sleep.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I apologize for not coming and hanging
out with your brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's understood.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, you're here now and we got to have
tons of fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tons of fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: So last night, Clint, uh, Clint actually
bought me a ticket to go see Ari Shaffir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, if you don't know Ari Shaffir,
he's on at midnight quite often.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, you got to watch at midnight.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're into funny shit, he's got a show
called, uh, this is not happening on
[SPEAKER_13]: Comedy Central.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got a podcast called the Skeptic
Tank.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then he just put a special out on
Comedy Central.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, paid regular.
[SPEAKER_14]: Paid regular about his experience,
uh, coming up at the comedy store in Los
[SPEAKER_14]: Angeles where most of our favorite
comedians seem to have gotten their start.
[SPEAKER_13]: At least, at least went through there for
a time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really enjoyed his comedy last night.
[SPEAKER_13]: Man, he tore it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have never seen or paid attention to
Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_14]: On the way up, Clint told me that Steve
Simone was the opening act.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Steve Simone was amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazingly funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a mostly clean comic.
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't, I don't think he ever said,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_13]: He might've, but I mean, it was in
passing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was something where it was,
it was so fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just, he's a ball of energy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's still in sixth or fifth grade.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: He pulls on his shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a 35 year old sixth grader.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's adorable.
[SPEAKER_14]: As a grown man watching him wiggle around
all uncomfortable, but comfortable.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like, like he's got all that
attention that he wanted, but now he's
[SPEAKER_14]: like, oh shit, I've got the attention.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he starts wiggling, but he tore it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: He crushed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was real fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then a shout out to Chris Charpentier
for hosting that show too.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that the openers get that short
little set because then they just do that
[SPEAKER_14]: highlight set.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: They get out of there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's kind of smooth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good way to just show yourself off.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Charpentier is a Denver guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're trying to get him to come down to
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to do stuff down here too.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still, I'm still an open mic'er,
but we put on shows every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, you know, we're busy with work.
[SPEAKER_13]: So everybody's trying, but made some new
friends last night.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was real fun at the Denver Comedy
Works, which is our favorite club.
[SPEAKER_13]: My favorite club.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely my favorite comedy club on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we got to make a whole bunch of friends
and it was, it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: People gravitate toward my boy,
Jeff here.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're six, five and have dreadlocks
and a big cheesy smile.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I was high as shit the whole day.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're that high and having fun,
people can tell they're like that guy's
[SPEAKER_14]: having a good time.
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to be his friend.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and they probably also wanted to be
sitting front row like we were.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, a little humble, humble brag
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: A big shout out to my buddy Baker from
Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_14]: He hooked us up with the preferred seating
passes and actually got a text message
[SPEAKER_14]: from him today saying, whenever we want
that, just let him know.
[SPEAKER_14]: And those are our seats.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said we are unofficial regulars.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're like a B level regular at that
comedy club.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So whenever we want to sit there,
those are our seats.
[SPEAKER_14]: Baker, you're my boy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Ari, we want to give a huge shout
out to Ari and Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those guys tore it the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I laughed my ass off.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've needed, laughter is therapy.
[SPEAKER_14]: My life is stressful being a pot grower,
having so many friends, having an internet
[SPEAKER_14]: life.
[SPEAKER_14]: My shit is stressful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I balance my stress pretty well,
but comedy is my medicine, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cannabis is my medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Comedy is my, my soulful release and
music.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But going to see comedy and laughing like
that, I feel like I got refreshed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And hanging out with you, of course,
bro, that might've been part of the
[SPEAKER_14]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you and I get to have good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's the thing with us is we
don't even, there's what?
[SPEAKER_13]: No time for music or anything on the way
up because we just hang out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Turn the radio down and talk.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably one of the better parts
about not seeing somebody for a month
[SPEAKER_13]: though, is like everything's brand new.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could agree.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would recommend everybody go check out
Ari Shaffir.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Check out Ari Shaffir.
[SPEAKER_13]: Support that guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: His t-shirts are 3D and they are awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wearing one right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're sweet.
[SPEAKER_14]: The sweetest t-shirt I've ever seen on a
tour.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super quick shout out to our buddy Deacon
Gray.
[SPEAKER_14]: Deacon Gray is experiencing throat cancer.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's been through all of his
chemotherapies.
[SPEAKER_14]: He looks good.
[SPEAKER_14]: His spirits are up, but I still want to
send you a big hug.
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of comedic love.
[SPEAKER_14]: Deacon is a Denver comedian.
[SPEAKER_14]: Support Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you don't know who he is,
but just send him a big fat jaw hug or
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever you believe in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Send him some vibes because he needs your
energy to get better over this cancer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think since laughter is medicine,
we need to return the favor to him.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's come down to Pueblo, down to Springs.
[SPEAKER_13]: He did a free show here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: He came to our little not super popular
town that has a bad reputation and did a
[SPEAKER_14]: show for free.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a Denver guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did he come here?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So shout out Ari.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And dude, thank you for the ticket.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for driving.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a champ, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, I-25.
[SPEAKER_14]: I-25 can suck it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but last night wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got up there, hit a little rush hour,
but it wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: So.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know my way right to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, I think it blindfolded me and my car
just goes there, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was so great.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was pretty great.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Ari Shaffir was awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's our point here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, if you guys get the chance,
go check it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check out Paid Regular.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ari would mind me saying this.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the Torrents.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go find the extended version on a Torrent
site.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please get the extended version.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's way better.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't check out the broadcast version.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: The name change is official, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: This show is now called The Grow From Your
Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to start trying to remember that
all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not I Grow Culture anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a new logo.
[SPEAKER_14]: The new art is posted, but Facebook and
Stitcher are slow to update.
[SPEAKER_14]: They won't change.
[SPEAKER_14]: Stitcher won't change probably until I put
up this episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been the wrong artwork, the wrong
show description for a week.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've emailed them and they're like,
we'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's free.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Facebook will change my name February 4th.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to verify that I am who I am
because I'm a business and shit and they
[SPEAKER_14]: don't want me just changing something.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're like, you get 14 days.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that comes up February 4th.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all coming up.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all official shit that I needed to
say.
[SPEAKER_14]: The website, iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have got shirts and hat pins and
stickers on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a bunch of black t-shirts in
sizes small through extra, extra large and
[SPEAKER_14]: white.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there are only about 10
iregenetics hat pins on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are going quickly.
[SPEAKER_14]: So grab those while you can.
[SPEAKER_14]: While you're there, join the forum on the
website.
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, I'm not trying to be a moot.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's a donate button on that
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go to the podcast page,
there's a donate button.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you donate, you can donate $1 up to
however many you feel like.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks of yours for my time and
[SPEAKER_14]: my effort, I would appreciate your
donation.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not begging, but somebody said they
would donate if I put that there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Feel free to use it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You donate.
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes directly to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of, it helps me pay for the
show because I do put in a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_14]: the show.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Still a free podcast though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Still free.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm never going to charge you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm never going to make you pay for
anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying if you feel like it was
worth something and it's like a tip,
[SPEAKER_14]: if you feel like you got good service,
put in the tip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Think of all the information this guy's
giving you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just be like, I could probably give them a
buck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got 5,000 listeners.
[SPEAKER_14]: If they all gave me a buck, I would
definitely buy new microphones.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up 5,000?
[SPEAKER_14]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd buy new microphones for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then my daughter's trying to go on an
adventure in Hawaii, an educational
[SPEAKER_14]: program.
[SPEAKER_14]: And until that happens, all of the money
that goes into that donate button will go
[SPEAKER_14]: to her.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just send that to her GoFundMe for
her adventure in Hawaii, her educational
[SPEAKER_14]: adventure.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, I know I did a bunch of giveaways on
episode 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still giving you time.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you haven't listened to episode 50,
go listen to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Learn how to win a bunch of bad-ass prizes
from the Garden of Whedon, prizes from
[SPEAKER_14]: Hygro and or Growing Supplies,
prizes from Irene Genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a highly educated t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: I plan on deciding the winners around
episode 52 or 53.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I make the rules.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll decide.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I see the right comment on what I
did, I don't even want to tell you how to
[SPEAKER_14]: win the prizes, but when I see the right
one, the winner, I'll go, that guy wins.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I'll know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be by episode 53.
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't drag it out too long.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Angela's sitting across the table,
looking all sweet.
[SPEAKER_14]: You look all red-eyed over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: What strain are you smoking tonight?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cana Tonic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cana Tonic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember the numbers on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's 0.5% THC and like almost 15%
CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to kind of rewind and shout
out to Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers
[SPEAKER_14]: in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where we got this high CBD
medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela is one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a lot about her and I'm going to
try not to talk too much about her world.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you feel like you need to slow me
down and tell me not to say that or
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever, feel free to cut me off.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try to be completely
respectful about this conversation,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it's your health that I'm talking
about and it's your private shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: So interrupt me whenever you feel
necessary and chime in when you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela used to dab with me like a fucking
champion, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela used to smoke fat.
[SPEAKER_14]: She would roll joints the size of my
middle finger and I've got a big middle
[SPEAKER_14]: finger and her and I would smoke them just
to the dome and then she'd roll another
[SPEAKER_14]: one and we'd smoke half of that and then
put it out and smoke it later.
[SPEAKER_14]: So she was a heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_14]: One day she had a mean headache and
somebody did the hippie pressure point
[SPEAKER_14]: where they squeeze between your forefinger
and your thumb.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a little spot in there that all
your old hippie friends will tell you if
[SPEAKER_14]: you squeeze that and rub that a little
bit, your headache will go away.
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of our silly hippie friends did
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she completely blacked out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Eyes did a little fluttering and she hit
the floor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when she came to, she was really
disoriented and kind of groggy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's been labeled a seizure is what
everybody, any medical person has called
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so she went home.
[SPEAKER_14]: She got home from work.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's the first thing you want to do
after that?
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to go fucking smoke a joint after
you just had some traumatic shit like that
[SPEAKER_14]: happen to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she tried that and she told me that
she felt like she was tripping.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, I'm hallucinating.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm seeing shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she put a blanket over her head and
laid down on the couch in the fetal
[SPEAKER_14]: position and wouldn't talk to me for like
an hour.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was hating life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the girl that I've seen take
half gram dabs and laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_14]: She used to make fun of Adam.
[SPEAKER_14]: We would smoke and Adam would tap out and
want to go home.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she'd be like, come on pussy,
smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: I smoked like two grams of wax to myself a
day around about- I'm going to push the
[SPEAKER_14]: mic to you just a little closer.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're great.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just wanting you a little louder so we
can hear you.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said that she used to smoke two grams
of wax a day by herself.
[SPEAKER_14]: And her and I hanging out together,
we'd kill and ate the hash in a day,
[SPEAKER_14]: just on a normal day, just her and I
smoking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So she went home and smoked one joint or
one dab or whatever and was freaking out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she thought maybe it's just today,
you know, she gave it some time and went
[SPEAKER_14]: about her life, but she still had a
headache and didn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so she smoked more weed and every time
she would smoke weed, she would just get
[SPEAKER_14]: ridiculously high.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like hanging out with a high fifth
grader.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're like, you got to tuck her in and
get her something to eat.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not talking shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it's really what was happening to
her.
[SPEAKER_14]: She went from a pro to Clint.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to babysit her when she would get
high and she'd get super anxious,
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of anxiety from smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we found a few strains that would work
better.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Platinum OG was working well and the
Girl Scout Cookies was getting her too
[SPEAKER_14]: high, but it was kind of a more
comfortable high for her, it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_14]: So she didn't feel really- it's been about
a month and she really did not feel good a
[SPEAKER_14]: few days ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been about a week, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: This only happened a week ago?
[SPEAKER_14]: The part I'm getting into now.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was probably a month or two ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: When the seizure incident happened and
the- Longer than that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been like three months now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I only know because I like really want
to get high like I used to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I do.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's affecting her.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of, it's affecting her- A lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like even when I'm not smoking,
my anxiety is just super shitty.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not being able to smoke, she obviously
you kind of jones for some smoke because
[SPEAKER_14]: it's ritualistic.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just wanting to get high.
[SPEAKER_14]: Her and I used to pass a joint back and
forth and lay around and smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_14]: together.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, it just feels good to get
stoned and smoke.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like being sick and not being able to
smoke the medicine that she relied on,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's driving her crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can fucking see it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's making her kind of grouchy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we call my friend Joey at Natural
Mystic Cannabis Caregivers about a week
[SPEAKER_14]: ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, Hey bro, do you have any
high CBD?
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, I sure do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on up to the shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get you set up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I could remember the budtender's
name.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was super helpful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would hire her if I owned a shop any
day.
[SPEAKER_14]: That girl knew about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: She had great skills.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I remembered your name because she
was awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know that she'll ever listen to
this, but she deserves a shout out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we go up there and we get the CBD
medicine and we got Cannatonic,
[SPEAKER_14]: Cannasu and Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're all super high CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got Tora Sue actually.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, but we get, we get to the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to be discreet here,
but we got to the fucking car and she
[SPEAKER_14]: wasn't going to wait.
[SPEAKER_14]: She rolled up the joint and she started
smoking it and she got about halfway
[SPEAKER_14]: through the joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I looked over like you're smoking like
a lot of weed over there for someone that
[SPEAKER_14]: has panic attacks or smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she looked at me and she goes,
I am high and smiled about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, Oh, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's working.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: So for myself, I've smoked a lot of CBD
cannabis and I've written it off because
[SPEAKER_14]: it didn't seem to really do anything for
me.
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't do, I want to get high when I
smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to feel that psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's slightly, I don't even know what to
call it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That head change.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be fucking high.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to get high when I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And CBD doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've written it off.
[SPEAKER_14]: If they're like, this is a high CBD
strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, well, I'm not going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause you have pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I'm just wasting that dab or that
joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I know it's helpful for patients,
but watching her, it changed our entire
[SPEAKER_14]: day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, she smoked that joint and half of
another one.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I smoked half of one with her and
I had taken a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_14]: We stopped to smoke on the drive and I,
we pulled over and got out and did a
[SPEAKER_14]: little hike and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I took a couple dabs, but then after I
smoked, that joint, it felt like my dab
[SPEAKER_14]: high was kind of diminished.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, no, you're not as high as you
used to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, why am I getting mellow?
[SPEAKER_14]: But it made me higher for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got giggly.
[SPEAKER_14]: We both got kind of, and I don't get
giggly from smoking weed, but smoking that
[SPEAKER_14]: joint of CBD, after a couple of dabs
changed, dabs don't give me an eye high.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I, I miss when I smoked weed back in
the day, my eyes would get all droopy and
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be like, damn, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dabs don't do that to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the CBD, we totally put that back.
[SPEAKER_14]: It did that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think I'm missing something when I'm
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I need to smoke more flowers and I
think I also need to incorporate more CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, I'm getting clogged up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you feel like CBD is like a,
not to call marijuana like a hard drug or
[SPEAKER_13]: anything, but do you feel like CBD is a
drug unto itself?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like THC is a drug and then CBD is a drug?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like when you get your tolerance going for
THC, maybe that's not the same tolerance
[SPEAKER_13]: you would have for CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a different compound.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's affecting a CBD receptor instead
of a THC receptor, which is also a
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabinoid receptor, but it's going to
affect you differently.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that sounds like something that,
that people should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, no, it's not just marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, no, you needed to kind of know
what's in that, like, or what style it is.
Completely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because now we're going to focus on
finding her a lot of CBD medicine because
[SPEAKER_14]: she's been taught, how far through that
bowl?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you about halfway now?
[SPEAKER_09]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have like a hit or two left.
[SPEAKER_14]: Clint's been here for 30 minutes and is
she a different person?
[SPEAKER_14]: From when you got here?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You were laying on the couch in the dark
and now you don't even have the sunglasses
[SPEAKER_13]: on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seems like you're doing all right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's helping you.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's making your headache go away.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're, you look better.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't look like you're trying to hide
from the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when you don't feel good,
you guys, you know, when you don't feel
[SPEAKER_14]: good, you just want to hide.
[SPEAKER_14]: You put your hoodie on and you try to curl
up into a little ball.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you can actually almost disappear if
you try hard enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But your kids always find you and it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: All my customers today thought I was high
because I was so, my headache was so bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: My eyes were squinty and they're like,
man, you must be stoned as fuck today.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela's the bud tender over at the Spot
Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo
West Colorado, the spot for high society.
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop in and say, what's up to this cute
little dreadlock girl?
[SPEAKER_14]: She's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's blushing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, how cute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Check it out though.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a nice spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the only, the spot's the only
marijuana store that I've been to because
[SPEAKER_13]: normally I have other contacts where I can
get marijuana from, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a very nice store.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the people in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were all super helpful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Had no problem finding what I needed to
find.
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a nice store.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cute little shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's under construction in the grow area.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as soon as it's ready, there will be
some Rasta Jeff growing happening in
[SPEAKER_14]: there.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get in the whole world excited about
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: How much of that have you talked about so
far?
[SPEAKER_14]: On the show?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not much because we haven't... Because
it's not super... It's not my business
[SPEAKER_14]: yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: If that makes any sense, all your
headphones cut out.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not my business yet to be talking
about really.
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't talked about what I can say.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can say that there are over 200 lights
and that it's hydro and that the rooms are
[SPEAKER_14]: fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been in a lot of grows, a lot of big
grows.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I walked in there, I went,
damn, you guys did this shit right.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a showroom.
[SPEAKER_14]: You open these two swinging doors.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's double doors or one
door.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a huge fucking door.
[SPEAKER_14]: You open it and you walk in and there's a
showroom.
[SPEAKER_14]: The grow rooms are glass.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that you can see into two rooms and the
water room.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there will be... They plan to do visual
tours and shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get me on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to go look.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: That part I know I can say because that's
hyping it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to advertise that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm saying that's happening,
but I don't know what else I can say.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm the grower there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Man, Colorado is just cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping to do a lot of things with
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got ideas.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got ideas.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just need to agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel you, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So she's backing up another bowl over
there of that CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than today, has it been helping you?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know today was an extra stressful shitty
day for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: This week really hasn't been as bad as the
last three months have been for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure if I smoked this before
work that I would have felt better than I
[SPEAKER_09]: did today.
[SPEAKER_14]: You wouldn't have to bail out halfway
through?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_14]: So why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to be at work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get me out of here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Luckily, she works with the person that
did the hippie fucking hand technique and
[SPEAKER_14]: he's kind of sympathetic still.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you should play that card whenever you
can.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be like, you're the one who did it to
me, asshole.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're damn hippie magic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn Vulcan hand grip.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to take a dab while you want to
hit that bowl while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: Clint's not smoking this evening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Clint's off.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to drive here pretty soon and I'm
not capable of- You can smoke this with
[SPEAKER_09]: me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't get you high.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Saturday night and there's a UFC
fight and there will be police everywhere
[SPEAKER_14]: where you're headed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just going to chill out and hang
out with the listeners.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you guys are smoking, maybe you're
not.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's the best part about this
podcast is it's just information.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Jeff's doing a good job of trying to
make it fun and educational.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you're making it educational.
[SPEAKER_13]: Finding that borderline.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the tough part is because you guys
can ramble on about a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's, like you said earlier,
is maybe I'm the guy that because I don't
[SPEAKER_13]: know a lot about this stuff, even the
questions between CBD and THC,
[SPEAKER_13]: like I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I should talk more about CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a book or I'm not even going
to pull up a website.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to kind of spat out of my
head.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD is a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's pronounced cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_14]: It works more as an analgesic and
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's known to have antibacterial
properties.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really well known for, and this is a
good segue, it's really well known for
[SPEAKER_14]: stopping people who have tremors and
seizure type disorders or conditions.
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't even call it a disorder.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a condition.
[SPEAKER_14]: Calling it a disorder makes it sound like
you're fucking condemned or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: People with seizure conditions.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was telling a random story that I
will tell on this show in a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was telling a story to a friend who was
a paramedic and she said that CBD stops an
[SPEAKER_14]: electrical firing in your brain that
causes seizures.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be really helpful for
anybody with seizures.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD definitely makes me hungry.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I'm not smoking that bowl.
[SPEAKER_14]: My first or second hit off of CBD,
my stomach goes... So if you've got some
[SPEAKER_14]: cancer and you're not eating from the
chemotherapy, dude, smoke some cannatonic.
[SPEAKER_14]: That stuff makes me starve.
[SPEAKER_14]: We went to lunch and then smoked right
after lunch and I was like, well,
[SPEAKER_14]: you got to go back in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I'm full, I'll get hungry from
smoking the cannatonic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That stuff just makes you want to eat.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can play guitar longer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've noticed that I got a new guitar for
Christmas and I've noticed if I play too
[SPEAKER_14]: long, my wrists and my forearm,
my fingers hurt.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can just keep going now and I may just
be building up endurance, but I don't feel
[SPEAKER_14]: any pain from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would cramp up after a while and now I'm
not.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this CBD stuff is instead of like the
head high that I normally get where I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: just flying through the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it's more of a body high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_14]: You would probably experience a body high
because you're really low tolerance to any
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabinoids, but people that have smoked
a little bit, it just goes straight to
[SPEAKER_14]: pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like it knows where the pain is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, oh, your arm hurts.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to drive right up to your arm.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to park here, let out my little
CBD paramedic.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to work on your arm or your
head or your neck and shoulders because
[SPEAKER_14]: she's had a lot of weird symptoms lately.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I cut off my description of what
cannabidiol is, but it's a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the opposite of THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the one that goes down instead of up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it tastes like cherries.
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely think that a lot of herb that
has CBD in it and extracts made with CBD,
[SPEAKER_14]: they often have a cherry, like a cherry
hall's cough drop or a Luden's kind of a
[SPEAKER_14]: taste to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I've always thought of CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm high in random.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've talked about how it affects me.
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes me hungry.
[SPEAKER_14]: It made me really mellow.
[SPEAKER_14]: It made me kind of smiley, like put a grin
on my face, like a giggle.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then here's a really random story.
[SPEAKER_14]: You ready for this one over there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh gosh, I know where this is going.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had a long day.
[SPEAKER_14]: We went to Springs and bought some
cannabis, which is an hour drive away.
[SPEAKER_14]: We went to lunch and then we came home and
like two beautiful people do, we got
[SPEAKER_14]: naked.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're both loving what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And after about an hour of us giving it to
each other, I kind of looked at her like,
[SPEAKER_14]: I love what you're doing, but I'm never
going to finish.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've done everything I love and this is
not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she kind of looked at me like,
me too, and I'm going to embarrass you,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it usually doesn't take much for her
to be done.
[SPEAKER_14]: She gets three to my one because she's a
girl.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not complaining, but I mean,
I didn't even see one.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's obvious when it happens.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see one.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, well, she's not either.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so she goes, I think that CBD,
and I was thinking it right as she said
[SPEAKER_14]: it, she goes, I think that CBD weed killed
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was the whole time it was
happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, I was almost there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was fucking amazing the entire time,
but it just wouldn't, there was no grand
[SPEAKER_14]: finale there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, it's not you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's like, it's not you.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I talked to my paramedic friend and she
said that that same electrical firing in
[SPEAKER_14]: your brain that causes a seizure is the
same one that causes you to orgasm.
[SPEAKER_14]: And by smoking CBD, you pretty much just
turn that sucker off.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said that opiates will do it times
10.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, good luck getting a boner on
opiates.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, huh, never really.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said it just straight turns off that
electrical firing mechanism in your brain
[SPEAKER_14]: to where you'll never come.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like she said, you probably could,
but like, you know, it's going to take a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot more effort than what I really like
her.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't want to try that hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a gallon of sweat later.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, my legs were sore and I was kind of
sweaty.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, you're cute as fuck and this
is great, but I'm going to take a brain
[SPEAKER_14]: check, you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had to do that before.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's whiskey dick for me though.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I'm not finishing today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had CBD dick, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, it was working, but it just
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got that CBD dick.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a few times he won't even
smoke my CBD weed for that reason.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, Hey, I'm not going to smoke
that wink weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, part of the reason I don't smoke
it is because we bought a limited supply
[SPEAKER_14]: and I don't need to waste it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't do much for me other than make
me hungry and not make me nuts.
[SPEAKER_13]: So- What's the price comparison on it?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that dispensary is very
completely fair and it's, they have three
[SPEAKER_14]: different price points of that herb and it
averages at $200 an ounce, but it's a
[SPEAKER_14]: medical only shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have to have a medical card to get
in there, but $200 an ounce is a very good
[SPEAKER_14]: price because she works at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_14]: And did you sell an ounce today?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we barely ever, because it's like $560
out the door or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: After taxes and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to buy a little white bag that
locks to even carry your ounce out in.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the first accessory.
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't even like, you're going to,
because you have to have that to leave the
[SPEAKER_14]: dispensary because that's childproof.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how the dispensary watches their
ass.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know that that's, so they
actually have to sell you that bag or
[SPEAKER_13]: that's kind of like given with the $560.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the $560, but they could,
some dispensaries charge you for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what the $560?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we have the childproof bottles and
then we are supposed to charge for the
[SPEAKER_09]: bags for edibles, but most of the time we
just give them to people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're buying a lot of stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Recreational is expensive.
[SPEAKER_14]: They stock up at that shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: The people really like to stock up when
they come.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun watching them shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: People are mesmerized.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, come to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're from another state, drive out to
call Colorado, go to the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're coming from the South,
go to the spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're up North, dude, go to like,
I don't even know who to tell you to up
[SPEAKER_14]: North.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll find a good spot and I'll recommend
them soon, but come to the spot in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_14]: West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got such cool shit in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got like 25 strains of herb on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've never been in a dispensary and
somebody shows you 25 jars full of
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis, you're going to smell every
single one of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: The budtender is going to start tapping
their foot because they've seen them all,
[SPEAKER_14]: but just, just, just look at every one of
them and enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry I'm doing that to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're the budtender and I'm
telling them to do that, but enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check that shit out, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Spoil yourself the first time.
[SPEAKER_14]: But look, it is so freaking neat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I remember the first time I went
into a weed store.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm from here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, either that or save yourself some
money and start growing your own.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here, I'll make up for telling them to
take all day.
[SPEAKER_14]: The budtenders do accept tips.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a tip jar on the counter.
[SPEAKER_14]: So make sure you toss some shit in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big tips.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only 600 bucks for an ounce out the
door.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people are from out of state and they
can only buy a quarter anyways.
[SPEAKER_13]: They drove all the way here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm an open mic comedian.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure if anybody's heard me before,
they know how unfunny I am most of the
[SPEAKER_13]: time, but I'm not trying to say I'm a
comedian.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying I'm an open mic'er.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's like one of my big things is
just how cool Colorado is compared to
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody else around us.
[SPEAKER_13]: God, it must suck being from Utah or
Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Kansas or New Mexico.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear I hate Texas at least 15 times a
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of my customers are probably,
50% of the customers seem like they're all
[SPEAKER_09]: from Texas.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they hate Texas because they have to
drive from there just to get legal weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's changing though, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: The world's changing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, do what you can where you are to get
cannabis legalized in your area so that
[SPEAKER_14]: you don't have to drive all the way to
Pueblo, Colorado to come by an eighth for
[SPEAKER_14]: like 70 bucks.
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of people making changes,
I wanted to give a shout out to our buddy
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike for holding it down at the city
council stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Neopunk, you're really kicking ass,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He does 12 hour days, 13, 14 hour days
just so that he's able to get to the city
[SPEAKER_14]: council meetings.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he got to work at six the other
day and finally got home from city council
[SPEAKER_14]: at 10.30.
[SPEAKER_14]: So however many hours that is,
Mike's putting them in for us so that we
[SPEAKER_14]: can grow, so that we can smoke,
so that we can do what we do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here and not feel like criminals again in
our local area in the 719.
[SPEAKER_14]: So shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good, thanks for reminding me of
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, weren't you saying something?
[SPEAKER_13]: We were driving up yesterday.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got talking and I asked how's Mike.
[SPEAKER_13]: He said, well, they got this kind of thing
going on and they were talking about like
[SPEAKER_13]: your backyard stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want Mike in here to talk about
that better or like how city council is
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to make it to where we can have
less plants in our backyard or something
[SPEAKER_13]: like that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we've kind of talked a little bit of
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: City council is trying to limit us to like
six plants per household.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you have to grow it in an outbuilding
not attached to your house.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mike and I, Mike mostly, but since I
know a lot about growing, I was able to
[SPEAKER_14]: contribute a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: But Mike wrote pages and pages and pages
on why that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's been going to every, he goes to
the planning and zoning, the city council,
[SPEAKER_14]: city commissioners, any meeting that he
can sit in and go, this is why that shit's
[SPEAKER_14]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_14]: He shows up and puts it, and he's working
at like a 45 hour a week job doing
[SPEAKER_14]: construction too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's putting it in and he's doing,
he's actually building grows for the
[SPEAKER_14]: Denver bud company.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's cannabis-ing in some way or another.
[SPEAKER_13]: But just, thanks Mike.
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're on Twitter, follow Mike,
what's he, neopunk?
[SPEAKER_13]: Nemopunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's numbers after it.
[SPEAKER_13]: 13.
[SPEAKER_13]: 27.
[SPEAKER_13]: Something.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: 53.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be in the show notes for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll look at my Twitter.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm following him.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not even going to say mine now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we talk about the weed brain I got on
the way up there?
[SPEAKER_13]: My goldfish memory.
[SPEAKER_13]: My goldfish memory.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I have such a low tolerance.
[SPEAKER_13]: We smoked before we, I smoked here,
I smoked one hit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the funniest thing to me
because I know it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to hold a conversation with
people, but I, I smoke one hit off of my
[SPEAKER_13]: little pipe and I am like 30 seconds I'm
like, what was I talking about?
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's every 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hilarious too.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I tell Jeff like, yeah, I just don't
remember what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's like, dude, it was four seconds
ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, I just don't remember.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We get off on these tangents.
[SPEAKER_13]: I get excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a pause at one point when we
were driving.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember who was talking,
but there was a pause and we looked at
[SPEAKER_14]: each other and I just go, I don't
remember.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just an unspoken, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're trying to hold a conversation
or if you're trying to be the cool guy,
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe marijuana, like for the first time
isn't the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wasn't even planning on smoking at
the show.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just like, ah, we'll get back to the
car.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll smoke in the car and we'll head back.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then when Ari Shaffir passes the joint
to you, it's like, ah, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: I probably should.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You were silent until we got to the gas
station to get gas.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking out the window, just
enjoying, just thinking like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_13]: it was so funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so pretty out too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I think I said one thing,
Denver's so pretty.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a beautiful night in Denver.
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't ask for a better evening.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than those damn horses.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Jeff, my boy Jeff here has had
nightmares and he's afraid of horse drawn
[SPEAKER_13]: carriages.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: He let me know this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So every time a horse drawn carriage was
coming our way, I just punched that horse
[SPEAKER_13]: right in the face.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell him, get out of here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, there was, there were border,
there were boundaries drawn.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if that horse got that far,
then that was when the punch would come.
[SPEAKER_14]: But luckily you never had to drop that
horse.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really wanted to see you just fucking
sucker punch a goddamn giant horse.
[SPEAKER_13]: That would have been so great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to cone in that horse.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just boom.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Datuma.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what would have been a good
tagline after you punch a horse.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not on my watch.
[SPEAKER_14]: Something really random.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not on my watch.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know any like horse names,
like secretariat.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got nothing, man.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kentucky Derby of dropping horses over
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico for a
short period of my time of my life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had a dream, a nightmare that on the
plot, well, this actually happened on the
[SPEAKER_14]: Plaza in Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are horse drawn carriages carrying
yuppie folk around all the time,
[SPEAKER_14]: just on dates and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they got like Christmas lights and
candles on them and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're all snazzy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a dream one night that I was in my
car.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I could see this horse drawn carriage
up the road, crossing the street.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just could not stop.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was only going like normal speed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't going over 45 or 50 in my dream.
[SPEAKER_14]: But my car and I were like, stop.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I plowed into the horse drawn carriage
with people in the carriage and it was
[SPEAKER_14]: chaos.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it scarred me, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: I woke up, oh no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mean to kill the horse.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now when I see the horse drawn
carriage and I'm driving, I'll fucking
[SPEAKER_14]: turn left and go somewhere else,
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they can just ramble on and I'll
backtrack.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be back when you're not around.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there was a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of them last night in Denver.
[SPEAKER_14]: That part of like the 16th street mall
loves horse drawn carriages.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yoga pants and Ugg boots.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the nice part.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the uniform.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Horses and yoga pants is crazy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know what to think.
[SPEAKER_13]: Stretch them out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Stretch them out.
[SPEAKER_13]: The one size fits all, apparently.
[SPEAKER_13]: The hole for the tail.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, what was the place we ate at that
pizza place?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, shout out to the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was yummy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was yummy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the dankness.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, that was a great trip.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for making that happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was your fault.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you drove, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate you driving.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no way I can get high and drive.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not seasoned.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get high and drive.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't say you did.
[SPEAKER_13]: I said I got high before we left.
[SPEAKER_13]: I took like six dabs, but I didn't get
high and drive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't drive high, please.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't drive high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Know your limits.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then we got talking about why Jeff
doesn't drive when he's like cashed.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's because Jeff's kind of an
ambassador for, as I see it, like with
[SPEAKER_13]: this podcast and stuff like that,
you're trying to make weed as acceptable
[SPEAKER_13]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, you look like a hippie.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you both got dreads, but you don't
need to be making the classic mistakes
[SPEAKER_13]: that every stoner movie showcases.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, oh, he's so stoned that he can't get
off the couch or, oh, he's seeing six
[SPEAKER_13]: shades of gray or something like that
because he smoked himself color blind or
[SPEAKER_13]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, it's the dude where's my car
effect where everybody's an idiot.
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of brought it up was there was
traffic was going crazy up ahead of us and
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, pay attention to which way the
turn signals go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Clint found that to be some sort of
genius fucking observation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that the mile ahead, I can see the
turn signals flicker in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know if I need to start going left
or right now, cause I'm just going to copy
[SPEAKER_14]: the turn signals and I'll be in the proper
lane instead of fighting for it when I get
[SPEAKER_14]: up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Getting cut off by two Priuses was not
cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: You weren't supposed to talk about that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was passed by a fucking Prius and it
felt very emasculating.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a soccer bomb card though.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're asking for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn signals are going on up ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just stoned enough to go,
Oh, that was really smart, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what that I was like,
well, I got to pay extra attention and be
[SPEAKER_14]: more, a little more on top of it because
I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm more than an irie genetics,
Colorado cannabis t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: The car reeks of dank.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though the herb is in the back of the
car, in the backpack, in a bag,
[SPEAKER_14]: it is real.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want that because I will scar the
community.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like, and this is what kind of
brought this up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I kind of represent,
I have chosen to represent the community,
[SPEAKER_14]: not just myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a lot of us that do it,
but I'm one of the people that have chosen
[SPEAKER_14]: to speak out and put myself in the
spotlight for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I need to be not a malnourished,
too skinny dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to not be the cliche on the couch.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to not be the red eyed in every
picture that you see.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's why I got sunglasses on all
the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of want to bring that up so that
way maybe some of our friends who are
[SPEAKER_13]: taking the red eye pictures, maybe they'll
be like, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the cliche stoner isn't really what
we want to be showcasing to middle
[SPEAKER_13]: America, white America, who doesn't,
I mean, I'm a cracker.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, and for the longest time it
was, it was something where weed was
[SPEAKER_13]: dangerous because we're indoctrinated with
that through dare and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, back in the day, and they taught us
that the Mexicans and the black jazz
[SPEAKER_14]: musicians would smoke weed and rape white
bitches.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd turn into a demon and rape the white
women.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was what they fucking, reaper
madness.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we were taught.
[SPEAKER_14]: Propaganda.
[SPEAKER_14]: And people, my grandparents, they were
smart enough to go, wait, that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they had friends that were like,
your kids are smoking weed and we're never
[SPEAKER_14]: even going to be your friends again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause like my grandparents raised cool ass
kids that were all potheads.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I got three uncles and two aunts and
my mom, and they were all potheads until
[SPEAKER_14]: their adulthood life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of them still smoke.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of them gave them it up just because
my mom can't smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: She gets so stupid when she smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the thing with weed is there isn't
that, me and my buddy, Paul, Paul Rosales.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out Paul.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_13]: He's probably at home.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_13]: Check out wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we, we were talking about it the other
day and there's no, like with heroin,
[SPEAKER_13]: you get sick if you try to quit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And with meth and all these terrible drugs
and, and, but marijuana for the longest
[SPEAKER_13]: time was in that same category.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like everybody thought that that's,
oh, it's, it's all the same, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: but nobody talks about like, oh,
I can go into a seven 11 at any time
[SPEAKER_13]: before 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_13]: and go buy as much alcohol as I can fit in
my car.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and no, that's okay because the,
take it to the state park and drink it on
[SPEAKER_13]: your boat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're completely allowed to.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you could, I, I've been sober from
alcohol for eight years and I had to quit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to quit because I had a real problem
with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fortunately, I didn't get withdrawals when
I decided to quit, but I do know people
[SPEAKER_13]: that do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get shakes at all?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been so long ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just over it and would never forget
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was literally 22 years old when I quit
drinking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, when you started at like 14,
but that was the thing is you could get
[SPEAKER_13]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alcohol was, you could get it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like cigarettes were back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could get weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're never going to stop you from
getting what you want.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't remember the dare officer
being like, dude, alcohol is the one you
[SPEAKER_13]: got to be watching.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they put fucking, if you look at
alcohol commercials, they make you think
[SPEAKER_14]: that if you drink Dos Equis, you are the
most interesting man in the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't always drink Dos Equis,
but when I do, I get two chicks.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get a boat.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get a cool ass dog.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone throws a party.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like all this balloons happen and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like fucking, just cause I drank some Dos
Equis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, but on the opposite hand,
like anytime that you're smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_13]: you're the stoner that sits on the couch
and you're just so typecast is that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's such bullshit.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to give you a shout out,
Jeff, for being a good representation of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully some people on the, on the other
end of this podcast will agree with me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm absolutely positive they do because
after I posted episode 50, my email and
[SPEAKER_14]: social media feeds have exploded with
people saying, thank you for this show.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, you guys, you overwhelmed me.
[SPEAKER_14]: You made me like, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a feeling in my heart.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know what to call it,
but there's this big bright white light
[SPEAKER_14]: that goes around my chest area.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I think about it and my friends in
this room can see it in me when I'm
[SPEAKER_14]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like wiggling.
[SPEAKER_14]: You do get excited to have that many
people email me and go, dude, we're
[SPEAKER_14]: fucking proud of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And your show is awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I'm overwhelmed and super excited.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations on 50, by the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what's this 51?
[SPEAKER_14]: 51.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: 51.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got Angela on 51.
[SPEAKER_14]: She said she never wanted to be on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally tricked you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I blurred you with weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking hippies.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted you to be here when I told the
story about us not being able to,
[SPEAKER_14]: to finish our sexual escapade,
because I want to do your respectful about
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would have to play the episode for
you and let you edit out anything you
[SPEAKER_14]: didn't like anyway.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you kept us on track and kept it nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm glad you came for that part.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you, do you like, how's the store
treating you?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you like working there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: She can't say she fucking hates it.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like working there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, recreational is definitely a lot
different than working medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the novelty like definitely wears off
kind of quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it just becomes a job a little
bit, but it's still, um, when people come
[SPEAKER_09]: in for the first time and they're really
excited that like makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't really complain.
[SPEAKER_09]: I sell weed all day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Previous meals or the drink I just took,
but yeah, I wish I wouldn't have found
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I go hang out at the spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes I'll show up with food or
sometimes a boss will just have random
[SPEAKER_14]: questions and I'll pop in and I don't want
to leave when I get there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause it's fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's everyone's just hanging out,
selling weed and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's a nice place.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're sweeping and cleaning and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, you can bullshit with me while
you're sweeping and cleaning and there's,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's fun there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the crew is all like family too.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all get along and a little too well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a little too well.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're silly as shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope everyone's listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I look forward to getting in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I totally over took over your answer,
but I look forward to getting in there
[SPEAKER_14]: because it looks so much fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have a favorite product from there?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there something that you would
recommend as a, as a, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the apothecary lotion.
[SPEAKER_09]: I make Jeff rub me with that all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause my shoulders are always killing me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that stuff is the shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: The extra strength.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was skeptical of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't believe it would work.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, uh, one time I rubbed her down
with it and it made my hands all fluffy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it definitely makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to apothecary, the Grammy
Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something that's, see,
that's just stuff that it's like,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's so it's a lotion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a lotion.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a topical.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't get you high, but it definitely
is really relaxing for your muscles and
[SPEAKER_09]: everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I definitely deal with a lot of neck
and back pain and that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I put it on my knee and it helps my bum
knee a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Makes it not hurt when it gets cold.
[SPEAKER_14]: My knee hurts and rub some of that on
there and it won't hurt no more anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: I said no mo.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you pick that up on the recreational
side as well as the medicinal side?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_13]: See, these are the questions that need
answers.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why we brought Clint.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see how long we've gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to look and see how long we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just chatting here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not even paying attention.
[SPEAKER_14]: 49 minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had some news articles.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that'll be episode 52.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just save those.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no need to get into the bunch of
news.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, my news is that February 21st we're
doing a benefit show at the downtown bar
[SPEAKER_13]: in public Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I'm not sure if there's a cover.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure there is a cover, but I don't
remember what it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but I'm on early.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm on it like three o'clock in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, we do a comedy first and then they're
going to do bands after that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so you pay maybe five bucks.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a benefit show.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, February 21st.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who are we benefiting?
[SPEAKER_13]: That is for Pops.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, for Pops.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up Pops?
[SPEAKER_14]: Benefit you, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll, uh, the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll try to figure out some way to
contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Irene genetics and team.
[SPEAKER_14]: Irene will have to do something because I
did Pops is, uh, I used to grow specific
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD medicine for Pops back in the day.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just got to grab my phone real quick.
[SPEAKER_14]: Clint's going to grab his phone.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's got a note in there or
something.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got some notes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so February 21st in public Colorado,
the downtown bar, there are going to be a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot of comedians.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I've seen something about this,
but I see so many things on Facebook that
[SPEAKER_14]: I, my brain doesn't absorb all of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, downtown bar, there's going to be a
lot of good music.
[SPEAKER_14]: There'd be a lot of good comedians.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get down there, support Pops.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pops has been a staple of the Pueblo
community for a long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, if you're from Pueblo and you've ever
been to any drinking establishment and
[SPEAKER_14]: you've had to deal with that old guy
outside with the gravelly voice that
[SPEAKER_14]: checks your ID.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see your ID.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Pops.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Pops.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know Pops and he's helped somebody to
not get your, to not kick your ass at one
[SPEAKER_14]: point in your life.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've been to the bar, Pops has been
the bouncer in the security guard and
[SPEAKER_14]: there's always that one asshole in the bar
that wants to fight and Pops will protect
[SPEAKER_14]: you.
[SPEAKER_14]: So shout out to Pops.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's, uh, he had lung cancer, so he needs,
we need some help for that dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Clint, get to your notes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm rambling about Pops for a long time
now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is, uh, February 21st at the
downtown bar, music and comedy,
[SPEAKER_13]: and show starts at like two, two PM and
I'm going to be on maybe like three o
[SPEAKER_13]: 'clock, but it's, uh, the comedians.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to talk about the comedians
because there's so many guys coming down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Dan Rainey, uh, myself, Paul Rosales,
Matt Chapman, John Brown, Wade Ridley,
[SPEAKER_13]: Charlie McMullen, Ben Verbeck.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they're all there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so good.
[SPEAKER_13]: You said go fast.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was, but that's, that's like a really
good group of funny guys and I'll be on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, you can even get a smoke
break.
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at all the funny guys you get to play
with.
[SPEAKER_14]: That means that you're actually funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: All those dudes are quality comedians.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every one of those guys has funny shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: None of those guys are hacks.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have made a joke on Facebook about a
local comedian being a hack and every
[SPEAKER_14]: comedian in Pueblo thought I was talking
about them.
[SPEAKER_14]: The people that you just listed are not
the hacks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those people tell jokes they wrote.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, that's, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope they all heard that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Southern Colorado comedy is, is really
pushing forward with our own senses of
[SPEAKER_13]: humor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you might not like me, but you're
going to like one of the guys on that or
[SPEAKER_13]: you're going to like one of the people on
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all friends.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's my favorite thing about the
comedy, uh, culture is it is, it is kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of like a weed culture.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they go hand in hand almost is
because everybody knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, we went up to that show.
[SPEAKER_13]: You knew people that knew people.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was people, our waitress was like,
do you know this person?
[SPEAKER_13]: Nah, I kind of know this person though,
but, and they know that person.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was, it's just a community.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it was great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, that Chris Charpentier, I told him,
I was like, dude, we need to get you down
[SPEAKER_13]: to Pueblo because he had been scheduled
down once, but he couldn't make it that
[SPEAKER_13]: night.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, but that was one of my favorite shows.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was David Borey came down with Sam
talent and it was great and Byron Graham.
[SPEAKER_13]: So shout out to everybody that's comes
down to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're really trying to work hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, every second and fourth Thursday,
we're at the rainbow bar on Santa Fe doing
[SPEAKER_13]: an open mic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, trying to promote that we did one this
last week and it was, it's so fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's such a great place for comedy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I hope everybody can come out and check
it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Support local comedy.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys, even if you're not in Pueblo,
there's comedy where you are.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you're an aspiring comedian,
start the scene, do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_14]: All it takes is you to go stand somewhere
and tell some jokes and invite some
[SPEAKER_14]: friends to come listen, get four or five
people, make a little comedy showcase at
[SPEAKER_14]: the bar every slow night.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wednesday nights are good for it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thursdays, Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're on on Thursdays because we
don't want to compete with a downtown bar
[SPEAKER_13]: every Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but you know, we do the second and
third or the second and fourth Thursday,
[SPEAKER_13]: we're going to be at the rainbow bar.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just, I'm hoping people can come
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a free show, free show, super fun and
free fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: The guys I'm working with are so funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super free fun comedy night.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just became some Asian commercial.
[SPEAKER_13]: Super free fun comedy night.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it got racist.
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't last in an hour without that for
comedians.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know?
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're back.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_14]: It felt the, you said how comedians are
friends.
[SPEAKER_14]: It felt like once we hung out with Ari for
just a couple of seconds, it just seemed
[SPEAKER_14]: like just some other dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We smoked out with Ari in the alley and it
didn't even seem like we're smoking with a
[SPEAKER_14]: celebrity.
[SPEAKER_14]: He just smoked weed and he's like,
all right guys, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_14]: It had some phone texting going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he had some booty call to go 10-2
and he was out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was just a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there was literally a couple of
minutes there where nobody was talking and
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody gets so amped around like
celebrities, but I really do feel like Ari
[SPEAKER_13]: Shaffir is a celebrity.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's put in so much work to get to where
he's at and his special was so good and
[SPEAKER_13]: his special just came out.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, you would have thought like
all these guys that listened to his
[SPEAKER_13]: podcast would have been all up on his
nuts, but everybody was just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah, we're just, you're just a guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's how he acts.
[SPEAKER_13]: He has a sweet sweater on.
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't like hearing about, I listened
to your show, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Episode, whatever was awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: He just fucking, I don't want to talk
about me anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like he didn't care.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, I'm just a dude, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you, I did too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I told him that if you get a chance,
if you're going to listen to that Skeptic
[SPEAKER_13]: Tank, was it 202 with Ali Sadiq?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: 202, I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that was such a good episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So check that one out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to listen to the Ari
Shaffir Skeptic Tank, listen to the
[SPEAKER_14]: episode that is titled Paid Regular.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's start with that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's one of the best.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's episode 201.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe 200.
[SPEAKER_13]: 200 was a couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Comedy buddies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was really funny too though.
[SPEAKER_13]: Danish and whatever.

something else.

[SPEAKER_01]: From hot to cold, the blink of an eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she can't be told.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can try.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about a girl
[SPEAKER_08]: that confuses me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what she think or what she do
to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: First she treat me like a king and then
she through with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But truly I give her love and every day,
cause it's my duty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if she kind of moody rides.
[SPEAKER_01]: She make you a king when you do her right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're back to suffering when she puts up
a fight.
