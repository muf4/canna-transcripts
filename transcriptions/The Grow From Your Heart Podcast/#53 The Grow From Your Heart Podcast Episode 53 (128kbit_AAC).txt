[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, a pro grower,
if you're a new smoker, or if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
activist, or if you're just someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, and it's time
for episode number 53.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a hard time breathing because
we just took some fat dabs in this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's looking at me like,
yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit on my left.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got King Cola again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right in front of me, to my left a
little bit, I'm going to say the 11 o
[SPEAKER_02]: 'clock position is my new friend,
Alan.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over here, the guy who I want to call
somebody else because I was told somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: else was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my good friend, Nick, is over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promised you guys Jay would be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of Jay, he sent three minions
in his place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how important that dude is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me three guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been sitting here at the table
bullshitting for a few minutes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and these guys know they're worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ready to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to talk wormage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got all the worm puns figured out
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have heard the worm puns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get too far, guys, I got to give
a big shout out thanks to Ku and Kat from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_02]: They allow me to play their music at the
start of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is cool as shit because playing music
on a podcast is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds weird, but you got to
pay to play people's music on your show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you got to do that, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Music should be free, free, free,
free freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Royalties, royalties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are royalty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the kings of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art is not free anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Art is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the artist has got to get paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Kat and Koot for letting me play
their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you just pulled out a cool surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The solvent list.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to totally interrupt the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon Headed Stranger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I forgot it was in the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, that is terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trichome heavy, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trichome heavy extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that totally derailed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to do an ad for Hygro,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like lemon paint thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon paint thinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took a trip to Lowe's to get some grow
supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to figure out a good way to
dab that one.

[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you hear us much respect to all the
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to announce it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of our new sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the official name?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is now brought to you by the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to say yet because I
have not written a commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you worming with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do worm son.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could go on forever with that I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some cool worm puns going on
pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, those guys are going to help me
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to contribute organics and
they're going to part of their
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know it, but I'm going to
sucker them into teaching me how to throw
[SPEAKER_02]: away my bottles and we're going to get me
working with all organics that will be
[SPEAKER_02]: supplied by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of my grow equipment will come from
high grow and all of my organic supplies
[SPEAKER_02]: will come from the worm company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be killing it with a
sponsorship help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you guys are, you've changed my
growing already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using a lot more grow Kashi,
a lot of worm castings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got a question about that coming
up for you in just a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can almost get to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read the commercials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys showed up early, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three paw heads showed up to my house
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Punctual stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be a perfect question since
you guys are from the organic side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking about grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually gave some grow Kashi away in a
prize package recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my listeners, a lot of the
listeners have been asking how to use the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read the instructions and it says to
fill up your reservoir with however many
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you add a third of a cup of Kashi
and then you mix in, I don't remember the
[SPEAKER_02]: specific amount of molasses, but you mix
in a specific amount of molasses per
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you let it sit for 24 to 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that, I use that, excuse my cough
guys, we took some gnarly dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that's mixed, I use that and just
water it into the top of my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed that they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have other ways that you
prefer or recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys want to take that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this is Alan on the mic just so
that you know who you're listening to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in your teas, top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get your mycelium going on the top
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, sometimes you want to put a
mulch down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to get too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can watch out with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely you've seen results
layering it in your pot as you transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some dirt, then some Kashi,
then some dirt, then some Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're doing, whatever your
organic heart desires.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you're in there throwing some
worm castings, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Worm castings everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a difference in my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only been using them for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my plants, they're more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're wanting more water more often
because they're growing so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they're learning how to eat
by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to cycle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what you're doing is when you're
growing synthetically, you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: bypassing this entire organic life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just cutting everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just shooting it up instead of
feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that's actually why hydro growers
have to supplement with so much CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no CO2 produced in the
decomposition of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the number in front of me,
but I've been doing some research lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's actually a significant amount
of CO2 put off running like a no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: system in larger containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taught science, but it's not
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been done for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes back to the tribes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference between Bokashi and
Grokashi?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll take a hit because you looked
at me like I'm a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't need the cotton mouth on the
show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the Band-Aid brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grokashi's kind of taken over the industry
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Grokashi is Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Grokashi makes their own mix of
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi is nothing but a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it's a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it can be any medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use sticks or stems or oat bran,
just any sort of carbon-based material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to inoculate it with
typically yeast, photosynthetic bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar, you follow our feeds
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probiotic Farmers Alliance stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not mistaken, Grokashi actually
adds in glacial rock dust for trace
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what makes up their mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company will actually
start carrying their own Bokashi here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can add a lot to your Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ours will actually be inoculated with
humic acid, some local animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you'll get a little piece of
our gardens in yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of love spread around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to try to keep it local.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky Mountain Natural Farm is trying to
keep everything in Colorado, bring back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it's important, especially
in the cannabis community, to give back to
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see it a lot in other states that
have been doing it a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their community is a little bit more
integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up in NorCal, a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how farming should work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a specialized product, but it's
definitely farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an artisan product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes with anything, with wine,
cheese, meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instruments, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Computers, cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should want the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with organic practices, that's what
you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actual medicine that's pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not smoking anything that shouldn't
be in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean just gave me the, yeah, get away from
the MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me want to get back to the how
to use the Grokashi, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to leave them without some
sort of answer on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was definitely going to come back
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd definitely try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so basically, for me personally,
if you just want me to tell you how I use
[SPEAKER_00]: Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's hear it, because you're great
at this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, when I do my initial
transplant out of a Red Solo Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil mix traditionally, because I make
my own soils, will have Grokashi in it
[SPEAKER_00]: already, or my own form of Bokashi or
Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll have it in the soil mix,
but I always top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I transplant, always top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually, it's with cover crop,
a little bit of Grokashi, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just water it in with a
product we carry that's called SeaCrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically, it's kind of like
fermented seawater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that your fish?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not a fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I use this in place,
traditionally, if you're familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it in the place that it's got a lot
of fulvic acids, a lot of trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things that you're not going to
get from your basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see a lot of coastal growers use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a micronutrient bottle to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use SeaCrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I usually water in with a
SeaCrop right after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll roll into, basically after
that, it'll be every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through and do a Grokashi Dreg,
which is basically what you're referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do mine a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is use a grinded herb
traditionally, like Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll use a, take basically,
if I'm doing a 10 gallon thing of tea or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Grokashi Dreg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take my Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix it in there, depending on flour,
veg, radiant green, or flat flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have those, you can use
alfalfa for kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dump that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually at whatever recommended rate
you're going to run a tea with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I add in a fourth a cup of Bokashi
per gallon, a fourth a cup of worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings per gallon, and then one teaspoon
of, depending on what stage, I'll either
[SPEAKER_00]: use molasses or yucca in some sort of
carbohydrate source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I seal it up and then forget
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say like 12 to 24 hours, but in my
personal experience, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wrong with taking a 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fermenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, as long as you want it to go a
little longer, rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells bad, it is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, if you're familiar with those
probiotics, kimchi, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll, you'll start to learn what good
ferments are, what bad ferments are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want that almost sweet,
bitter and not funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the, once the fish smell over powers,
then it's funk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as you want to seal it up
also, you said, yeah, what I usually do
[SPEAKER_00]: is, uh, everybody's probably got a bunch
of Panda film laying around somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I usually do is cut a big square
or have a big square Panda film that was
[SPEAKER_00]: left over from like a floor door or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made, and I just lay it over the
container and wrap it in string and tie it
[SPEAKER_00]: tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it doesn't have to be,
yeah, you know, this is, this is all in
[SPEAKER_02]: my, you know, management at the home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would have happened by nature running
down a hill into a big shitty puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that we're going to try to
balance out, uh, aerobic and anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, uh, in nature, both exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were for the exact reason you
were saying things fall on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decay, uh, you have puddles of
stagnant water, animals dying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hotspots in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by introducing these things on a
regular basis, I've, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that that's where we're kind of
getting a biological edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a difference in my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's only been a couple of
weeks, but just feeding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are ready to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, so you've got your protozoa cycle
nutrients, your fungal hypha, the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: content, there's nematodes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just getting this turbine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's funny because, you know,
you go to the hydra store and you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: they sell nematodes and you see that they
sell great white and you see that they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell OG tea and they sell all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, if you take some time to go
to Rocky Mount Worm Company's website,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually look it up and you'll see
that all of these things are already in
[SPEAKER_00]: your worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can make your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take five small scoops of worm
castings and a five gallon bucket of water
[SPEAKER_02]: of good clean water, reverse osmosis,
clean, dechlorinated water, and bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: that shit for like 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've just made great white.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've made all of those products on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that if you're new to
making teas, or even if you're familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with making teas with, worm castings,
a lot of people will use like an Alaskan
[SPEAKER_00]: humus from General Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, they're using one cup per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't waste your, like,
you're just going to be wasting money and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be creating a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very powerful worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fourth a cup per gallon is all you're
going to need with J's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write that down because I
don't, I think I used more to tell you the
[SPEAKER_02]: truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it written down in the grill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, that's one, I would even go
one cup per five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to keep it real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's, you're going to get
every... And you got to leave room for
[SPEAKER_02]: foam, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave room for foam because that's just
going to foam up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, if you do have a problem with
the foam, you can always add in some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a fat lipid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could use like a fish hydroslate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil, caraja oil, coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put neem oil in there, how much would
I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, to take away foam, you would
just kind of like drip it off your finger
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bottle and it'll just kind of
go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend more, let's just throw
in a, plants love coconuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seriously, coconut water,
coconut powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love coconuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you eat them and you, you know,
buy them at the supermarket, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: grab an extra one and throw it in every so
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would throw a tea,
like if your stuff's foaming up too bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw a little bit of coconut oil in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foam will go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your floor nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, buy a drip tray twice the size of
your brewer or brew it in like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Rubbermaid container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics can get hands on and a little
messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to, when I started, I've been
through every nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss back in the day mixing 42 bottles
of advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like the mad scientist looking for
the perfect mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I can do it with my organics with
the help of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I first started growing was
with bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, my first grow, I,
I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I messed those plants up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I had went with organics,
but I was nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now after actually, you know,
practicing it and going hands on and just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of diving in and after reading a lot
of the books, you know, they help,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you get to the end of them and it's
like, this is just life and just what has
[SPEAKER_01]: been happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what you've learned in,
in science class.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, going a little
farther beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where like the Korean farming
comes into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that that's a little bit
more hands on, but once you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: start somewhere small with worm castings,
you know, that's a big step in your
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to get hardcore into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be completely self-sufficient
and we can help you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can help you to where you, you'll never
have to go to the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never have to come to Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never have to rely on anybody to
grow your own plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to do that, you're going to
have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's somewhere is worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've jumped in exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start with that base and then
you'll start to understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is why I'm mixing it in with
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff starts to make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see like root growth on
your plants after you transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using root bags for this run and
they're coming out of the bottoms
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually those roots that fall out of
the holes like that, they die off,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're still reaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're crawling around the room on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can find some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're stoked about life in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little shop of horrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got huge roots now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're white.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're super duper white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kashi and two applications of worm
castings is really all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't be afraid to use the worm
castings in the soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when you transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% is what I typically go with for my
personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it take for those worm
castings to become bioavailable to my
[SPEAKER_02]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say theoretically,
instantaneously.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not, there's no MPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an MPK value, but that's not
why you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're adding them, the reason
that you're going to get, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say instant results, but it results so
quick is because when you introduce those,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not like, it's not like a
fertilizer that you're waiting to be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just dropped a spaceship and that's so
there are little worms in these worm
[SPEAKER_02]: castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are a little tiny baby worms in
the packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get some worms in your cast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tells you that that tells me that
that shit is alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that worm was alive in there,
it got shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were packaged in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, I bought it in Pueblo at
high grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it in my, in my car for a day before
I even was able to bring it in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you can't haul in all the gross shit
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I will say though, when
purchasing worm castings, the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do is seal them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put them in a sealed
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they will dry out and that's,
that's one of the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll waste a lot of money doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause once they dry out, then they're no
better than anything off a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just that packaged stuff at the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all dusty and then I can see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now someone came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like playing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that in the last episode,
I said, they smell so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I would, but it's,
I said, it smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said that people are going to make,
think I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I said, it smells good, but I love
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of why I grow dirt still is
cause I love the smell of good dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smell great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came to Colorado, it like hurt
my soul to not see dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just the, it's just,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have loamy soils.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say there's a lot of dirt
here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice coastal loamy soil, a lot of
decomposition, trees, all that water and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of deciduous forests that are not
die off and dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get out of, I haven't been out of
Pueblo much here lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got to get in the car and go to
Manitou with us one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just go on random.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to Denver a lot and just say,
I haven't had any time to stop and enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best place I've been to was Estes
park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the closest that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a Manitou junkie though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I get a chance, it's the
Montefactor and just a little walk on
[SPEAKER_02]: Manitou avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go visit the poppy seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a chiropractor up there that
charges a dollar a minute, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll eat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pops a, one of my favorite people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pops her back once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We drive up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talks about cool thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that we work at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that that's where his patient
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fan of the arcade up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is better than when you can just cut
loose, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Manitou springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who don't drink,
people who like, who don't do hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we cut loose?
[SPEAKER_00]: We go play penny video games.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What our parents used to do in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are turning into old people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my back hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: My knees crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when you could get up without
making sound effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I walk up the stairs,
I'm like, crack, crack, crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to just joint one in my hand all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You aren't sneaking up on anybody,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Alan's coming upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, aside from the drag we go,
I'm just trying to stay on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I like to let it go a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like jam band music.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let it go for a minute,
some gold may just come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't after a minute,
I'll put you back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're going to be recycling soil
and organics, and you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay sustainable, you can put it in your
soil bins when you're recycling your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: to help break down organic matter in
there, such as leaves and stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold dead roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root balls, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a top layer, mix it in while you're
covering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mulch is my next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mulch is definitely something I need
to contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixing Bukashi into your soil,
traditionally it's a 2% by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have to build a trough
or something or buy a rez or something to
[SPEAKER_02]: mix up your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tarp on the ground works, but it's low
down and it's hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kitty pools are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kitty pools are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then buckets and then store it in
buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: River maid containers work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ass trash cans.
[SPEAKER_01]: 27 gallon roughness.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you guys see that white stuff growing
on your soil, don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people open it up and see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See that white growth and throw their shit
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mix your soil, grab some Groukashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to reamend your soil,
make sure Groukashi in, put your
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments in there, like you were saying,
mix it up in a kitty pool or on a tarp,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them up in a Rubbermaid container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I would recommend doing is
swinging by Jays and picking up either
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoons or if you really want to,
it's a lot of fun, but live worms and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just let them go to town because
either they're going to die or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They self-populate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll either get in there,
they'll do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your soil is optimal and is running how
it should, your worms will reproduce and
[SPEAKER_01]: you will have an active soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do help, but I know Sean's had
experience with them kind of over furting
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant with breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they find hot spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you mix your, so let's say that you
mix your soil and you're like bang,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I did that good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe throw some worms in there and they
tend to like, they find hot spots and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll work their way through it and they
tend to break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, actually I was running,
I went into one of my rooms and saw some
[SPEAKER_00]: test plants with a little bit of nitrogen
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tips of the leaves were kind of
pointing at the ground and they were a
[SPEAKER_00]: little dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feed them anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was actually alfalfa hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I mulch or that I used to mulch with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the worms went crazy in it,
started just eating the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess they cycled it and it burnt my
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't burn my plant, but it was,
it was taking up a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was, it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really kind of, you can kind of
overdo it with organics as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't, yeah, you really want
to be less is more with organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are, you got to know what breaks down
in what fashion and how long it takes to
[SPEAKER_01]: break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, knowing your plant,
don't, don't run one plant, one cycle in
[SPEAKER_01]: organics and give up because you,
you want to dial that in and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might take one or two runs,
but that's the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever your best friend told
you to mix your soil at, do it at half
[SPEAKER_00]: that rate because it's way easier to fix
the deficiency than this to flush out some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of something that you put in there
way too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro science does not work all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you carry any sort of dehydrated
coconut oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of revamping inventory we're
carrying soon will be a cover crops will
[SPEAKER_00]: be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All amendments will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have herbal inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just, we'll be able to offer things
like alfalfa meal, crustacean meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: oyster shell powder, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all organic, but we'll also be
carrying aloe vera powder, freeze dried
[SPEAKER_00]: coconut powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's of the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also be starting to carry,
I don't know if we can grind herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start saying that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we say that we're going to start
powderizing our herbs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company in the next
few months is definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: changing a face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is set in stone yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't say anything definite,
but the community is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot more things available to them
for their organic needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep an eye out, follow our
Instagram, Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some sort of like a feed chart
or something to go with all the goodies
[SPEAKER_02]: you're offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that available yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we're trying to work out
inventory first before we tell you what to
[SPEAKER_00]: use and not have it for you to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're really working on inventory
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked it out a couple of times,
a couple of the products that we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: had it on our, we call it at the Rocky
Mountain Natural Farming schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things that we had on there
initially are a little harder to source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that we'll be able to
keep the regimen up if people actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to make sure that if that
occasion does happen, like I was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess we can say he already
bought the damn grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start powderizing our
own herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we don't start selling them,
we're going to start doing experiments of
[SPEAKER_00]: powderizing our own yarrow and alfalfa and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will have, I would say April is
going to be the big kickoff date.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be at the Cannabis Cup in some
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't miss me with the beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Colorado, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of beards now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, I'll have some type of hat on if
I don't have my BMO hat on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Rocky Mountain Worm Company will
be, they'll be getting a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then potentially around that time
we'll have some new info that they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: release as far as, like I said,
us carrying a new product, us releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can come and catch us at the cup if
you- Yeah, come by the Rocky Mountain Worm
[SPEAKER_02]: Company booth, guys, because I will be
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to schedule probably a good
two hour block each day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cup is three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably pick two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to do different times or maybe
the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to meet as many people
as I can, but that's a landmark for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let them know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to come back on here one more
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime- Oh, we've got plenty
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let Jeff know when you want him
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be like, dude, noon to two, or like,
well, I got to get into the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to stand in line for three hours
before we can even get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after I get in the cup, I'll just go to
your guys' booth and I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just come and find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need a place to sit down,
dab at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some water for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, I started partying in the line
last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got out a dab rig and started dabbing
people out in line and the cops were
[SPEAKER_02]: standing there just looking at us like,
well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The booth will potentially have some
really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to have some example
containers of all of our cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have an example of all of the
amendments and things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some flowers there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll definitely have samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have plenty of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been one of the stoniest episodes
we've recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been a joint burning the entire
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are rolling up cones as we
speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to light up another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is the homegrown using the Rocky
Mountain worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you guys show up with,
show it up with smells and looks and
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we try to keep it connoisseur
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you should be smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of cut you off a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were about to hype out the Instagram
for Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us how we can find the worm company
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll do that again at the end of the
show too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since you were almost there,
I want to let you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Rocky Mountain Worm Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky and then MTN Worm Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can check Sean out on Rocky
Mountain Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a little, what's that
called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Rocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky MTN Underscore Natural Farming or
King Underscore Cola Underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work a link out so you can just find
all of us after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: When this episode goes out, I'll try to
post up all of those in the listing with
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post it up to Instagram and Twitter and
all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully people will find you and
follow you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any parchment paper,
but who wants a little fingerprint dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fingerprint dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep it real organic in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take a fingerprint dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that smells like some turpees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jibs and Ken from THE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jibs is an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're out at the, oh yeah,
shout out at they just won second place at
[SPEAKER_00]: the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be at the Denver Cup for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they'll be running some more
of growing Kush one mile high stuff and he
[SPEAKER_00]: will be stopping by the worm company booth
all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we'll come back with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to schedule hopefully some
times for you guys to come by and meet
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your favorite growers and standers
at the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot of people in
Denver, so it's going to be a real
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing Kush one mile high, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll have to try to talk to Jeff
down here one day, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dirty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can meet us in Colorado Springs and
mob down with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a gift for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, see, that's even warm and incentive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gifts are always worth a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of gifts, I have to reach for a
business card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did I put that business?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let you do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kind of guest on the show,
my new friend, I had to write down his
[SPEAKER_02]: name because I totally expected Jay and I
wanted to call him Jay all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Nick, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought me a killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wire wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a hippie, if you're a Wook,
dude, this is the most killer wire wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some, I cannot identify the Jasper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's Jasper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a red yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picasso Jasper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picasso Jasper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll remember that because I'll remember
the artist Picasso.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's red, yellow and green Jasper wrapped
in a really sweet wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen a wrap that style.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is from Clear Sky Creations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check him out on Etsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say the artist's real name?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Elise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out this artist Elise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Elise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am wearing this with pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody in the crew has got like
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of us all have links to her on
our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scroll through, we've all got shots
of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go through our pages, check our stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put a lot of posts of what we're doing
and how we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not hiding anything from anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't nothing that isn't already
available, so why not tell someone how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it as long as they're willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just check our stuff out and we're
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for this fingerprint dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells fingerprinty.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get you like 10 times higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to ask a question now so that
somebody will talk while I dab this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know about, I want to start a
compost bin and I've got some worm
[SPEAKER_02]: castings now and I don't have,
obviously I live in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to use that little space right
over there by the trash can maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you guys help me start my own little
compost bin like that?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, we'll get you a, as far,
I'll tell you what, as far as our first
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsorship agreement, I'll bring you down
a Bukashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start you some anaerobic compost
and then we'll also get you set up on a
[SPEAKER_00]: actual compost pile for more of a
traditional system so you can finally
[SPEAKER_00]: start to recycle all your leftover
avocados, your banana peel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Egg shells, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're vegan, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not vegan, but vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the worm castings are vegetarians as
well, besides some minerals that they eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that are worried about that,
don't be afraid to put it in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to all the vegans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was off mic for a second, taking one of
these delicious dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to turn the nail up to make
it burn better, but I want to turn it down
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a toss up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot there's a slogan there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we have for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't waste it to taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a flower guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hate us because they ain't us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peanut butter and jealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friend that watched that
movie with me twice this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the interview, James Franco
and Seth Rogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They killed that movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for the first few minutes I
wanted to smack Franco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, he's going to ruin this movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then like the director must've pulled
him aside and been like, tone it down to
[SPEAKER_02]: seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just go to seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think now you're just going to let that
man do what he does because he,
[SPEAKER_01]: if no one's watched Freaks and Geeks,
it's an older show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not too old because we're not
that old here, but it's a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old school Franco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen an actor spit so much in a
scene before.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got weird random.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the movie though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just like they perfectly did the
Lord of the Rings references.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On key.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was needed in that movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was just a beautiful movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was glad that Netflix put that on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so like a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get you a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start you with anaerobic compost so
we can start recycling all of your kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: scrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then as far as your plant waste,
the maze, different materials like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can also show you how to recycle those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what you're going to want,
what I would recommend doing would be so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to start a compost bin,
uh, take a leftover pot from last season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start out with a nice soil base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dump it in there and then just feel
free to start adding stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep a bucket in my, like a five gallon
bucket in my back door and then I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw things into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every couple of days I'll walk
that out to the actual compost pile in my
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then dump that in there, throw some
worm cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically I do, uh, for per like five
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do like a handful of worm castings
and then, uh, the secret is brewer's
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you throw brewer's yeast onto the
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you really want to Bokashi
grain, yeah, if you look at, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buena tea, the company, their fungal,
their compost accelerator is like a worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings, kelp and, uh, brewer's yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be amazed what you can find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, how do you know all this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, if you turn the bottle
around, don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then if it says it and
you're like, wait, kelp, brewers,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast, alfalfa, all of this stuff,
I see at the store is going by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yucca extract, molasses, you can try to
source it from somewhere that is sourcing
[SPEAKER_01]: it naturally, whether they grow it
sustainably or they've been growing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not be able to get it from where
you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, someone is making it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want it, it might be,
you know, if you can't find it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not looking hard enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craigslist, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people are your friends now,
you know, if you want barley straw,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want hay, you want manures,
you want compost, you want any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone that's feeding there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking, go on Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pay you to come and give it the
hell out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got all of my alfalfa hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the guy had to scrape his horse
pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if you're familiar
with horses, but they scrape the pins and
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and collected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a lot of the alfalfa hay that I
ran in my last grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it got repurposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't get thrown in a landfill and it
got to grow some great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't wasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last grow I was, I was really like
motivated to make all of my own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned how to kind of source it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From everywhere for just about free.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've kind of murdered yourself trying to
be so motivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you slow yourself down?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that basically all I had to pay
for last grow was power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any other money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was, you know, organics keeps
your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past like half a year has been a
little rough and I didn't have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: money to really do what we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, let's buy fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take the cores and the skins and the
pits and let's make a plant juice out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, oh, I can grow micro greens and
peas and sprouts and I can eat them in my
[SPEAKER_00]: sandwiches, but I can also ferment and use
them as a tea additive or a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing with my eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm buying eggs from the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to save my eggshells because I
can use that with apple cider vinegar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm already buying because I,
you know, I drink it for health reasons.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash my dreadlocks with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just mix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you brown eggshell, crush them up,
brown some eggshells, mix it with apple
[SPEAKER_00]: cider vinegar, water soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make everything in your grow
with nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got to learn where it comes from,
what it is, learn where nature would have
[SPEAKER_00]: provided it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go by the Oriental, if you're hungry and
you need, so if you and your plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry in the same, at the same time,
what I recommend doing is cruising on down
[SPEAKER_00]: to your local Asian market and grabbing
you some black fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact reason,
but I would just go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go and get you, that's what Dr.
Chow said.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I mean, you got to, he just got to go
with, he's a kind of the founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so you can take some,
so yeah, literally go and buy you some
[SPEAKER_00]: fish, clean it, eat what you want,
whatever's left over, blend it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, typically with like a brown
sugar, blend it all up together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then seal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30 days, strain it, add IMO,
which, or you get, which is indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So EM1 or lactic acid bacteria,
any of those will really work in that
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one thing about organic
gardening and sourcing things locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help your plant fight off a
lot of different diseases, pests that are
[SPEAKER_01]: found in your region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you're growing outside,
use a lot of different IMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we will be having a... Maybe we'll
get into that a little more in another
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be having a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I don't want to say it's a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go ahead and mention it on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to start doing classes,
but we need to know who wants to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to schedule a meet
and greet before this month is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe up in Colorado Springs, where if you
listen to us, you follow us on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've heard about the shop, you want to
talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you know, just we want to
meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get all of that stuff situated
now that we're a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear from Jeff's show when that's
ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll keep you guys posted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to announce when that stuff's
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do another night like that
at Hygro also in the future, but Jesse's
[SPEAKER_02]: been booked busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've actually talked to Jesse about
the potential of us teaming up and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some classes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get hands on with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is so good at just articulating what
needs to be done to like basic... I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: really anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can tell anybody how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping he was going to be here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I know they're doing some like
really cool classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they did like cloning last time
and some really like awesome introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping we can kind of team up and
maybe do some more advanced classes for
[SPEAKER_00]: the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off easy and then go into the heavy
stuff and then people can get your feet
[SPEAKER_02]: wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you come to us and you feel like
maybe you need to, you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we're a little over your head,
contact Hygro and Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll tell you, they'll walk you
through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll teach you how to clone and they'll
teach you how to pH or whatever you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whenever you feel comfortable or
you're ready, come to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I try to keep stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow me on Instagram,
the big toka underscore, I kind of try to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep things simple so everybody can kind
of grasp it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, you can delve into it
a little bit more because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, when they use bottle nutrients,
they go to the Hygro store and they ask,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you got to do some research
to be a grower and your plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate that and you'll notice it in
your results at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll explain things, but I'll let you
open your mind to it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be running a lot of
examples with products that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be carrying and research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's with Sean's page two and the
Rocky Mountain Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep an eye out and just be part
of the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you're in Colorado,
if you want to link up and talk organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're always around.
[SPEAKER_01]: When is the shop open?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shop is open during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get there before like two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little earlier in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 10 to four, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay is usually there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phone number's on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's there basically every day of the week
from about 10 to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then outside of that, just email or
call or message him through Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll meet you at 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or yeah, contact Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want it, we got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get you what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not just me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the people, the growers,
the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean to call you customers,
but the shoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to know that the product's
out there, but the help's out there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like you're doing this alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have put me on the track to
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like without a couple of conversations
between Spence and Sean, I'd still be
[SPEAKER_02]: using the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nestor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, shout out Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
Nestor, but Nestor up in Denver,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's won a few cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the shop he used to grow for,
but that dude gave a talk one night about
[SPEAKER_02]: soil recycling and reconditioning and
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sparked my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we can definitely get on here
again and have some more conversations and
[SPEAKER_01]: get into things a little bit more in
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my one argument with organics,
with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to put it in your plant,
I want you to freaking drink it before you
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't feel comfortable doing
that, then don't use it on your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will eat anything in my garden right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the worm poop?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll eat the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not have to pay me to ingest
something in the garden that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is how it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a patient, you medicate in many
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those ways is ingesting raw
cannabis as a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juicing the leaves, the nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of beneficial for that with
pain fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just with antibiotics in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So releasing a lot more of those
cannabinoids that aren't available that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can smoke or ingest through edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people can't take edibles or
ingest, and that's not what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a plant that you can actually
chew, it's what should be any vegetable or
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's for medicine, I believe it should
be food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be treating it as
medicine, then it should be food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational purposes, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to be, for example,
a medical dispensary, I'm calling you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit using the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know how to grow proper
cannabis for your dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: get at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sick people don't need phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even other companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I had a conversation about that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that off your shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take everything off your shelf and get
some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to educate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go jump into organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go and read every organic book and
buy everything in there because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost say use synthetics instead
of bone meal or blood meal because those
[SPEAKER_00]: are more harmful than they are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with glacial rock dust,
soft rock phosphates, different things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that azomites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry heavy metals and used in large
quantities like a lot of these super soils
[SPEAKER_00]: call for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting the same, if not more,
heavy metals into your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are using chelated nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to educate yourself and
that's key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to emphasize that if it's
for medical purposes and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: ingest it yourself, if it's not food
grade, it's not medical grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can eat worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend it, but the basis is
you're not going to get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says keep out of reach of children
and it has a warning label of what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get it in your eyes, that's not
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it can't touch my skin,
why can it touch my plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people are just not aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, just educate yourselves and
not every organic option is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a slaughterhouse product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cow leftovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way you source it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially depending on where you source
it from, a feather meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The McDonald's chicken farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crops, barley and stuff like that
that you're going to use as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out where you get that from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want any dyes or any pesticides
used with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 99% of corn is all GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for your seed sprouted teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a weird noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when that cord touches
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when the email cord
touches the microphone or the headphone
[SPEAKER_02]: jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, that was neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dab my eardrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody say something intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, I forgot what we were talking
about real quick because that's sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just sitting around the table
taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what we're taking a dab on
right now, but I just basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're really, we're still on starting,
running organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many avenues to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: My head is still making that noise from
the headphone jack after that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start off slow and don't read too many
books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go, like I said, source things that were
written a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a really good website called The
Unconventional Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Gil Card again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are really cool dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep it real simple and fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Esquiggles WordPress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cchar.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Microbes.
There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go to dot coms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to dot orgs or edus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even then, check where it was sourced
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to go to the library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just stick to weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep forums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not growing just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing a plant and this benefits
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're switching to farming now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this benefits you in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're on this subject, let's just,
you want to touch on some books real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Sean's apartment for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touch my books.
[SPEAKER_00]: T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good beginner book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't follow it word for word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, I mean, it's one of the best
books I've ever read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches you what you can and can't use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was detrimental in creating who I am
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the simple fact of that, it taught me
what things were, where they were from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really opened my eyes to how you can
create your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just take everything at face
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I mixed up my own tea,
that's the book I grabbed for
[SPEAKER_02]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first jump into organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes right back though to,
depending on how you personally want to
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and what level of organics you want
to be on, that's where you want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: things with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might not want to use all of the
phosphate products, or you might not want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use all of the animal-based products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely kind of a good guideline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing with growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing it your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Bonham might've played it and you can
play it and give it your own flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put an open hi-hat somewhere and do your
thing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your plants are in a different
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can mix up the same exact newts and
feed all of our plants to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of our plants are going to be
pissed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having girlfriends, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is not going to like the same
thing as the other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even getting to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that the TLO is a good place to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then while you're reading through that
or before you read through that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend everybody should just,
it sounds stupid, but just make yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should read some sort of Jorge
Cervante or Ed Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Horticulture is, yeah,
that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oxtradam course guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Marijuana Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend reading that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cut corners in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you might have to in the
beginning, but as you go, something to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is definitely upgrade your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dial it in, have an environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the organics, the one thing that
you're trying to do is mimic nature to
[SPEAKER_01]: your fullest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when growing in a pot and using a
chelated nutrient in a bottle,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's nothing living going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by bringing those microbes into your
pot, you're doing so much to your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually going back to what it
should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might take it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains might freak out depending on
where you get it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to do organics and you
like to start from seed, definitely start
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some good quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't skimp on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuts are good, but definitely a good way
to grow is start some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's bag seed, it's- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't oppose growing a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your dog was a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a bag seed and it turns out to
be a reg seed, pollen happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be beneficial for you to let
it happen the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a whole other subject as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they're not all female.
[SPEAKER_01]: More books.
[SPEAKER_01]: More books.
[SPEAKER_01]: More what you back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd read T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: would be one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Horticulture, Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of basic book.
[SPEAKER_00]: His books are amazing just because they
touch on so many different bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great gateway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you read books like that,
if you're not familiar with academia and
[SPEAKER_00]: going to school and things like that,
it really helps recharge you and teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to research and teach how to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I really recommend
reading books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the Rev, I think,
pinpoints his book is getting hands on to
[SPEAKER_01]: people that aren't necessarily,
like Sean said, book smart or can sit in a
[SPEAKER_01]: classroom and learn something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rev will tell a joke in the middle of
a paragraph in a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he'll go totally off key.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think, oh man, I hate reading,
or if you're not like that type of guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: just try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's different when you want to learn
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I would go with those books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you want to start getting a
little bit more advanced, obviously most
[SPEAKER_00]: people are familiar, have heard of Teaming
with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, it's a little complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I read over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quick reference book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll use the Rev's book a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see when you, as a beginner and
you're mixing soils and you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: teas, you're going to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up buying six copies
of it because you're going to have it next
[SPEAKER_00]: to your brewer and you're going to leave
it on the... If you don't know how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something, he starts you off and he lets
you know that you might mess up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, smell your teas or you're
going to smell bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaming with Microbes book will eventually
become like that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to the next level,
you're going to start getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've covered your basis and
you're a little bit more familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web and how things work as far
as nutrient cycling, and you get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more familiar with compost tea inputs,
why you're using them, and you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're using your bottled organic
nutrient, you got your earthworm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: in your mix, you're doing your weekly teas
and you're rolling and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already read these books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you live in a state to where
you don't really... Not everybody is open
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where I would turn is like where we
were kind of talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of PDF files about Korean
natural farming, different things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, natural farming inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I would recommend going once
you kind of get comfortable with your
[SPEAKER_00]: basis and that'll tell you how you can
actually make your own inoculates,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can make your own fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where... Save all your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the unconventional farmer shows
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rev, getting back to since this is
like a beginning into organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: he shows you different ways to do it that
might suit your growth style if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to necessarily do teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just want to use waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about like nutrient spikes that
you can put in your soil that are
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I first got into organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't have some plants inside,
so I needed to put them outdoors and not
[SPEAKER_01]: have to check on them that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, why not try it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overdo it, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can really mess things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I actually said on like what maybe
the first show about how I actually ran a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the rev stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it fucked my world up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal proteins and... You could really
overdo a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get super hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to decompose over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to give them their moment to
shine in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't try the revs mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is if you really want to
start mixing urine soil and like you
[SPEAKER_00]: really, you're just fucking just
determined on it and you go into the hydra
[SPEAKER_00]: store and you're going to pick up some
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you're going to go with the
back soil, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go sunshine four, you can go pro
mix, you can go happy frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally would recommend you going
with the sterile medium, something with no
[SPEAKER_00]: real nutrient pack to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start from a laboratory standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend like a pro mix or a base
sunshine mix or even a sunshine advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those options are really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't even want to buy urine back
soil, then just go and pick up a brick of
[SPEAKER_00]: peat moss from low lows, go and get you a
bag of perlite from the hydra store or the
[SPEAKER_00]: farming store or the garden supply store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just watch out because sometimes when you
source that stuff, things can come in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to treat it naturally
before you start using it or keep an eye
[SPEAKER_01]: on it because pests are everywhere,
little bugs, microbes are everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to bring in... How much are
my worm castings going to help me keep
[SPEAKER_01]: away those pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's going to build up just
everything in the soil around your
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to start fighting the fight
before your plant's even growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help build your plant's
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, it'll start fighting it
from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes back down into chitin and eating
bacteria and how that's cycled through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to come to... We're going to get
some... Tell Jeff you want classes because
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to get to talking about the
different aspects, what is in our castings
[SPEAKER_00]: and why they work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll do more episodes for sure.
Come and touch them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have you guys back soon because I
want to do an episode about... We can't
[SPEAKER_02]: have everybody... Guys, we're not telling
you throw away the bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what anyone's saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to find a balance for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be one of our next topic is the...
Find the balance between the bottles and
[SPEAKER_02]: the organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, yeah, just don't... Yeah,
don't toss your bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw anything away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly pick...
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some worm castings, start making teas,
and then slowly start working things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a... You're not just going
to magically become an organic gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dip your foot in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this could be the way to way improve
your growing though.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could make your buds taste better,
to make them grow bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste of your... Yeah, you can smell
it in this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just sweeter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of growers who will actually
go to make the transition and they'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: their nice little happy spot in the middle
and nothing's wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want, as a grower,
I know a lot of people who are really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy and just kill it growing synthetics
and organics together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like you said, it can really
improve your growing style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you want to commit to going fully
organic or you want to run synthetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that everybody could benefit from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit of worm casting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the flour that we're actually
smoking tonight was grown by a friend that
[SPEAKER_01]: works at the Grow Warehouse in Colorado
Springs who uses Rocky Mountain worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, but he integrates it with nectar
of the gods, but he uses nectar of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gods in a very low dosage with teas,
and he uses cover crops and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, so he does practice an organic style
of growing, but it's not full organic
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that bottle kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's got that little boost that it
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The training wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the training wheels, but he is
actually an arborist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we want to try
to be able to present through Jay is if it
[SPEAKER_00]: holds any merit to anybody, we're going to
call it Rocky Mountain Natural Farming
[SPEAKER_00]: Certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we'll do is we're going to try to
start looking into some of these products
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, and we will give it our stamp of
approval, and there is no armory listing
[SPEAKER_00]: for us, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an armory listing on certain
bottled nutrients and stuff, but we have
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to really go off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to create some sort of system,
and that's what we're really hoping to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know where you source from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is take the time for you to look into
where your products come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're made, how they affect the
final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if I'm in your store, I can buy
that and know that I didn't just buy
chopped up dead babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you who planted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you how it was harvested and
when it was harvested, and that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to have to hire more
people, open your doors more.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a couple of episodes, you're going
to get people knocking on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, and in the meantime,
as we get things working, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: please contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working really hard to make orders
and keep everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys ship?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have homies all over the place that use
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the website?
[SPEAKER_01]: rockymountainwormcompany.com.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can get in touch with any one of us
through Instagram or our emails that we
[SPEAKER_01]: will leave with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly recommend if you want
something out of the state of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend going on online and then
just sourcing it straight through
[SPEAKER_00]: rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as local growers, I cannot stress
this enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, stop by the store,
let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Jay a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to work something out,
but tell us that you listened to the show
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you heard about it and we'll give
you a quarter pound of cover crop for free
[SPEAKER_00]: just for mentioning that we're out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're nifty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to repeat what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the listeners were high.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you mention, if you shop at the worm
store and you say that you listen to the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast, they'll give you a quarter pound
of cover crop to start off your organics
[SPEAKER_02]: or say help out your organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll go on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll keep everything moist so that your
worms don't or your worm castings don't
[SPEAKER_02]: dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that your micro fungi go and it does
not die on you while it's growing in there
[SPEAKER_02]: when things dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think I let mine get a little too
dry lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use the natural enzymes of
plants that are around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one big thing with organics is
with sourcing things locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to do like six
episodes with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is, what do you want to hear
guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the month of March, like I said,
we're hoping to have some big things
[SPEAKER_00]: planned for April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping to have, we want to have a
meet and greet this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know who everybody's out there
planning to have a one or two classes in
[SPEAKER_00]: March, all leading up to the cup with our
business stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the month of March, we're going to
try to offer what I would call free
[SPEAKER_00]: consultation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we want to help you replace
your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to direct message me,
Nick, Alan, Jay, email us or Jeff and get
[SPEAKER_00]: in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we want to do is we want to know
what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to, we want to help you
out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this bottle, you could try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw away this bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if, for example, even if you're,
you know, if you're in Nebraska or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada or you're in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a computer or a
basement, we can direct you in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, yeah, what I was going to say,
or even we can, we can give you your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we can't, if it doesn't seem
logical, it's just been, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's that jet life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from, you know, over there,
the East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying I usually smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was respectful in this situation because
I didn't know if you smoke the blunts,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I am a blunt master.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean I know is as well from the East coast
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's not afraid of the blunts as well
as Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably smoke way more blunts than you
would.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, I brought the Dutchies,
but he showed up with the Dutchie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought the Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just didn't, uh, roll one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we have to roll one for a
farewell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some of us hate our lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love quality cannabis, but I love Dutch
masters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take one or two off it just to be,
uh, just to celebrate with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, yeah, we can, we can,
we can just not in everyday sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get so lit off the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes my head weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, it's a tradition in,
you know, I came out here and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: smokes joints, but when I came out here,
I couldn't find the Dutchies until one day
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a little convenience store that
had the Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to that little convenience
store in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a backflip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take all these Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: A homie told me about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came into a session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, man, you just made my heart
melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were fresh and it was a great
night that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to them for always keeping
the fresh Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So meet and greets coming up in March.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to interrupt you, but do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're up in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Nick and I just kind of, we did a
little side, uh, side meeting real quick
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, we might be having maybe like a
barbecue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we can do some organic,
um, you know, demonstrations there and get
[SPEAKER_01]: some little meet and greet sesh,
you know, get hands on, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just, uh, come up and we want to know the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start a community and keep
Colorado organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we'll, uh, we'll keep in
touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: In touch with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to set a date for a
nice little formal meet and greet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to come by for a whole
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to drop by and say,
Hey, Friday night, this is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll record you saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there, there are phones we can
text and things like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send a carrier pigeon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put your text on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you just, we'll get it to you
to get out there and, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just put a date out, but we're going
to have a meet and greet this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, next month we plan to have one or two
classes leading up to the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to, we're going to
try to help everybody out as much as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was saying before, if you want
to change the way you grow, email us,
[SPEAKER_00]: email Jeff, email Nick, email Alan,
email Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, tell us what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, you know, if you've ever done
organic, give us a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: background about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do things?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you familiar with organics
and let us help you, let us help change
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you grow or at least change the
way you source things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to shine some light on what
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to understand that's like,
you know, okay, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a better option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything that's in a bottle is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some companies do care what their patients
are putting into their plants and into
[SPEAKER_01]: their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some good companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, nectar of the gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're buying a lot of water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, yeah, when you go to the hydro
store and you're asking somebody a
[SPEAKER_01]: question, go to the bottle and read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of companies put a face on their
brand and that's marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not what organics is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics is actually like having the
product and it does what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of bottles put things on their
labels to make you go towards the bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: that exactly the same thing as another
nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be a little cheaper and it's
just, you know, it's the same value.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why some companies change their
label every three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big inside secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what that 98% entered ingredient
is, you know, water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to pay for that to be shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to drive it across the country,
put it in a plastic bottle, throw the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids in Africa need it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people can use that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, get some water coming out of
your faucet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just make your own nutrients with the
water coming out of your faucet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for a little bit over an
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should start wrapping it up because the
listeners get high is like we do and they
[SPEAKER_02]: start getting ADD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have anything they want to
plug or anything that they really need to
[SPEAKER_02]: get off their chest here at the last
couple of minutes of the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you go around the circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just RockyMountWormCompany.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check us out on Instagram,
RockyMountWormCo,
[SPEAKER_00]: RockyMountNaturalFarming, Kingcola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, we'll try to set up a
link to all of us on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it in the show notes and I'll
tweet that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just get in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was definitely a nice little intro
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there'd be six or seven of these
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you guys want to know,
like let us let us know and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hit us up and don't be afraid to,
you know, let's discuss some things and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let's talk organics and what
really needs to be done and not spending,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, too much on what needs to be
done and just getting it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really save some money and have a
beautiful quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why wouldn't you want to why wouldn't
you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let us know and we'll we'll see you
soon at some type of demonstration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbecue, sesh something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll keep you guys posted when those
are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, thank you for having us,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Big Toker underscore.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So follow him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some good pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I try to keep it real for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my it's lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that reached out to me and
got him on the show and got this group on
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sean's been here, but Jay was
supposed to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Jay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to get Jay on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear how much fun this is,
right, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy another car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come hang out with us, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jay does not medicate like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he will probably be floating on the
ceiling just from the the aroma around us
[SPEAKER_01]: from the second hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might have to put him in another
room or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I gave Jesse a dab, a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave Jesse a dab and he ended up on that
couch for about two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can totally believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any shout outs or plugs or anything over
there, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clear Sky Creations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Clear Sky Creations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure to say the name of the wonderful
artist that made this beautiful wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: His wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my wife, Elise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Elise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put her on a shorter chain so
that it doesn't cover up my ivory logo and
[SPEAKER_02]: end up in all my food, because at the
length it is, it'll end up in my food,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we figured you were a big guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to shorten it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the same necklace.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to make it a little
shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll rock it every day, every other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mine's shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, I'm down if you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks just about the right length.
[SPEAKER_02]: My food bowl goes right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: She makes them all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go have her shorten that one for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final word, go buy some worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do worms, son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to get worms from us,
use the tag, what are you worming with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to coin that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you worming with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to let us use your,
like we said, we're a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's come together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one random question to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm adding OGT into my mix with my worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wasting money now, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: OGT is sulfuric phosphate
trichodermahizarium, which has actually
[SPEAKER_00]: been taken out of like Great White,
a couple of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cycle nutrients too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're familiar with OG
BioWAR, but it's the same reason they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend not using the new pack with a
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll actually cycle nutrients out of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't even need the molasses every
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just answered a question I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a few plants that are showing some
deficiencies, and they're fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because I put so much OGT in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just take that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feed too much of certain things,
it can lock out other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you never would think that OGT would
cause you a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't assume so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's one of the good things
about OGT is a little bit goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a third of a cup to 25 gallons
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They try to give your plant that boost
that you don't get with the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes, because the plant's still
becoming itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, bottom line, using racumel worm
castings, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to use OGT.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear that, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not a hater of OGT, but these worm
castings are ridiculously cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the retardant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to put soft rock
phosphate or anything like that in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also sell that at the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make your own instead of
buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you a little bump in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have already given me 20 new
ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like seven products written down
that I need to go pick up.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple new tricks I want to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get your shout outs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said thanks to your wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's high at this table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to talk all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a long episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to read the part that I read
at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, thanks for listening to another
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't forget to check out our
sponsors, naturesgreenremedies.com and
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we hyped them up a little
bit on the show, the Rocky Mountain Worm
[SPEAKER_02]: Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out all my friends that came and
joined us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came and joined us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a proper sentence.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow them all on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the show's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the iTunes store or the Stitcher
main page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Search for Hygro Culture or no,
search for Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I printed the wrong paper again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just say that I was so upset about
that and that is just something that they
[SPEAKER_01]: should, I don't know, whatever Apple had
to say, but hey, you should get in touch
[SPEAKER_01]: with us because this is something that you
should have on your station.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's actually some, it's an
educational agricultural entity that does
[SPEAKER_02]: courses and shit and they didn't want
cannabis associated with their school
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, you got to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to use cannabis,
we can go with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hit us up and let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll totally get on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Grow From Your Heart fits
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do like it rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to grow from our heart in this
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not growing from our wallets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're growing from our heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll correct myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never say Hygro Culture again is Grow
From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find that review section in there in
iTunes and Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give me as many as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens is the more ratings I
get, the more they move me up,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more I'm advertised in the show,
the more people see us, the more people
[SPEAKER_02]: get to grow better cannabis, the more
people quit using MAP and DAP,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more people use worm castings,
the more people have better weed and the
[SPEAKER_02]: more patients feel better and then your
eyes are redder and things are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes in circles like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think the show is awesome,
tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think the show sucks, tell me.

but I'll probably just ignore you and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: doing what I'm doing because I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher keeps changing the way the
