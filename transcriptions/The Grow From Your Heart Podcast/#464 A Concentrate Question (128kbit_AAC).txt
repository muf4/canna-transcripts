[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: chicks and bros, smokers and growers,
friends and foes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 465 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This evening, I am taking dabs of India
Pale from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a full spectrum extract,
which means it is saucy and has chunks of
[SPEAKER_00]: diamonds and crystals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross is a blend of ruby red and peel
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, they describe the flavor
as hops, fuel and grapefruit rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly did not get any hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a fan of hops, so it is just fine
that I do not catch the hops aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a hint of fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grapefruit rind is there, but
honestly, this tastes more to me like
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries and hints of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that fruity flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big switch from what I normally go
for when it comes to concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, I've been buying the more savory
flavors, so it was a nice change of pace,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice change of aroma and flavor and
definitely a different buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: This went straight to my head,
made me forgetful, made me kind of have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard time paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says 68 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about this concentrate makes it
hard to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious India Pale Ale
[SPEAKER_00]: Full Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of questions from some
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to send a giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend Willie's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a giant thank you to our friend Mike
F.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out and a thank you to David
[SPEAKER_00]: OQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another giant shout out to Mike H.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast shout out, thank you and a
[SPEAKER_00]: fist bump to our friend Farmer John.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to send a big thank you and a fist
[SPEAKER_00]: bump to our friend Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you and big shout out to all of
the people who have been supporting the
[SPEAKER_00]: show through the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show, you can do so by visiting www
[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, at the start of
the show, I did say I was going to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: listener generated questions, so let's
jump right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very good question I received lately
was, at the start of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: you always tell us what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always Apothecary or Green Dot
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't you smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates made from your own garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first answer is I am not a concentrate
maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not make concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a cannabis grower and a cannabis
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably have a lot of other titles,
cannabis advocate, cannabis activist,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other things that I could
probably be labeled as, but I am a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things I find the most
passion for, followed by photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where my heart lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not find much interest in making
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate making is just not where my
passion lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got great friends like Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got great friends like Kev.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all the people that work at
Apothecary, all the people that work at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot, all of the wonderful,
highly trained, highly skilled concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: makers across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am letting them do that work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a dangerous process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a dangerous process making
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates I enjoy, the concentrates
I prefer are made with butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not familiar with a butane
extraction process, it sounds like it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working with a very flammable
hydrocarbon and any small mistake could
[SPEAKER_00]: result in an explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am leaving the concentrate making up
to the people with the proper labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper equipment and the proper
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to acquiring safe,
reliable, quality concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to shop at some of my favorite
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always mention Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Apothecary concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great price point and they are
great folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also really enjoy Green Dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make great products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a little higher in price point
compared to some concentrate companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like their concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the full spectrum extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the batters and I like their
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Apothecary Farms and Green Dot labs are
probably my two favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several companies competing for
third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I live in a smaller market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the availability isn't as broad for
myself as some folks in other markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Denver or Boulder,
you've got many more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got a few stores to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stores to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've narrowed it down to two or three
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those stores, they're top shelf
product is either an Apothecary extract or
[SPEAKER_00]: a Green Dot labs concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I buy my concentrates from
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why am I not buying my own strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Colorado, we have got some
ridiculous rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything sold in a Colorado dispensary
must be grown and produced in a Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Enforcement Division regulated
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program called seed to sale
tracking and it is exactly what it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like from the inception of a seed,
from the planting and germination of that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed all the way through growth,
all the way through harvest, all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then whatever type of processing is done
to that flower, if it is turned into an
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, if it is turned into an edible,
if it is thrown away at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is tracked all the way to the point of
retail at the consumer level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be tracked from the flower,
from the plant to the flower, dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it is sent to an extraction
facility or an edible maker, it is
[SPEAKER_00]: tracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is tracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That batch number of your flower now
becomes the batch number of that edible or
[SPEAKER_00]: that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number is now attached to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a problem in the future with
your edible or with your concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can trace back which flower batch that
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell which grow that came from or
the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we detect a problem in the flower or in
the concentrate because every flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: lab tested and every batch of concentrate
is lab tested, if a problem is detected,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to recall the products that
were made from that by following that
[SPEAKER_00]: batch number down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a seed to sale tracking
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time period where we were
allowed to bring plants into that seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: sale tracking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governing body who regulates the
plants coming into that system sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: turned a blind eye and allowed us to enter
plants into that system for a limited
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants had to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a short period of time,
the marijuana enforcement division played
[SPEAKER_00]: dumb and acted like all of these plants
were just part of some immaculate
[SPEAKER_00]: conception.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were just manifested and
ended up in our grow facilities and
[SPEAKER_00]: entered into the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not know what else to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not another way for plants to
enter a market to come from a non-legal
[SPEAKER_00]: market to a legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There had to be a way to get plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to enter our genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had seeds, there was a way to get
those seeds in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had clones, there was a way to get
your clones into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those became your plants for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there has kind of been a door
closed on the opportunity to enter new
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics into a medical or recreational,
recreational, that's a new word,
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis facility in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to introduce new genetics
into your grow, they have to come from
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds which were produced within your
marijuana enforcement division regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to grow a plant and you have
to find seeds within that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds need to be entered into
the system as new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can germinate the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they become veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a procedure that they follow in
the computer system to document that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, the entry time for new
genetics in the facilities has been cut
[SPEAKER_00]: off unless those genetics are produced
within a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, the only way to introduce
new genetics would be to breed inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, which is very costly and very
ineffective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need every gram of profitable flour to
come out of that facility as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are struggling to produce all of the
flour we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't spend time making seeds in one of
our rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What oftentimes happens is during harvest,
we may discover a handful of seeds in one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be chopping it up and a bunch of
seeds will go tink, tink, tink,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll go, hey, this whatever plant
over here, plant number 76533 just dropped
[SPEAKER_00]: out a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to the computer and you
say plant number 76533 dropped a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually weigh the seeds so you can
subtract that weight from your harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: total.
[SPEAKER_00]: You document how many seeds there were,
which plant they come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already forgot the number 765 something
fucking whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fucking forgot what plant they came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make up a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do in the MED system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That never happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always do it by the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, find out where those plants came
from, document the number, write it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: subtract the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got seeds in the computer with
a parent plant that they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MED would like to know the male and
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes in a grow environment,
who knows where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a commercial environment,
it was probably a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I want to share this
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not illegal to enter pollen into a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own a facility, if you're the
manager and you have got pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take your pollen and pollinate
your grow at your own disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want to do,
that is not illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen is not regulated by the
Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do want to breed, that is an
option in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is where the new genetics need to
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless this facility acquired some of
my genetics a long time ago during that
[SPEAKER_00]: window of opportunity, they do not have
iri genetic strains to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before these rules were put in place,
some facilities and some people were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to acquire my seeds or my clones and enter
them into their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some facilities, there are iri
genetics plants in their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen Lemon Jeffrey in several
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the Capelton and I've seen the
Grateful Dog in a couple of facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really don't know where the plants
have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are able to transfer plants from
facility to facility once they are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know who has what and where
they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do know is that Apothecary Farms
and Green Dot Labs do not have any iri
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in their stable at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one good thing about the extract
market in Colorado is something known as a
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50 deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a business talk
here for the Colorado concentrate market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different business
strategies available for a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a very common practice is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypothetically, let's say you are an
extract company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are Big Dick Jim's extract company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job is to make the best concentrates
for the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow your own flowers and you process
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them on the shelf and you've got a
vertical line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're extracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting it on the shelf and you're
making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody else involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got your own store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it goes to a different retail
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, as long as you're growing,
extracting and then selling the extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are making plenty of profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at some point, your grow will slow
down or you will be between harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: you won't have anything to process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're not making any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are only relying on that retail
product that has been stocked on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great way for a concentrate company to
make extra income and broaden their menu
[SPEAKER_00]: is what is known as a 50-50 deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that there is another grow who
wants concentrates but is not attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: a concentrate company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take their flowers or their trim
material and give that material to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extraction company will do their job
of processing your material into top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and they also package it into
individual grams that are properly labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: for retail sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once the flowers are processed,
you have got a bulk batch of processed
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates in retail-ready containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where a 50-50 deal quite often
comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate company needs to be paid
for their extraction work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a large lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They trained employees to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used equipment to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They packaged it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably paid for the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now there is a fee owed to that
extraction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times, the grower will let the
extraction company keep 50% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: finished product as their payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if that commercial facility gives Big
Dick Jim's Extraction Company so many
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of cannabis, they extract it and
they turn it into 100 finished prepackaged
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of cannabis and they have reached a
50-50 deal, that means that the grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: the extraction company each leave with 50
grams of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that grow gets to put that
concentrate on whatever retail shelf they
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got money to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a product they can sell
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate company, in turn,
puts those concentrates on their shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have just doubled their inventory and
hopefully, in that process, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: added some new flavors and added some
variety to their menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is a 50-50 deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, they split it 50-50 with the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower sells it however they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: At their retail end, it has got to stay
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This all stays in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, the extraction company puts it on
their shelf and they sell it at their
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how they get paid on their end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that can happen sometimes is
the original grower will buy back the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they run it, they have got 100 grams at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell it back to them at a premium
price, which is pre-agreed upon before the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction is run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they run the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, the grower actually buys it all back
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, they send it to their retail
location and they can put it on their
[SPEAKER_00]: retail store or they can spread it out to
other retail locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have got multiple stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to spread it out to different
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have got a wholesale deal lined
up to where they already have a customer
[SPEAKER_00]: that wants to buy a bunch of it and then
they can put that on their shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most cases, it is either a 50-50
deal where the extraction company ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: with half of the final product and the
grower or the facility ends up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: other half of the final product and that
gets transferred to a retail store or it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a buyback deal where the grower sends
the material and then they run it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: say, there is 100 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will sell it back to you at this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, they put it on their retail shelf
and they mark it up quite liberally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the money is made in the
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is the long explanation of why,
when you hear me talking about what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing on the podcast, it is rarely an
iri genetic strain because most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is not in the Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few facilities do have it, but you have
to find a facility that has got the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: who has also ran the extraction,
who also has it on the shelf available in
[SPEAKER_00]: my area for a desirable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a lot of variables to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes elevations in Colorado Springs
will have some wonderful lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, but they also let different
concentrate makers make the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let different companies run the
material so the product comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: differently through each processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those processors I approve of,
some of them I will not buy their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sometimes they may have lemon Jeffrey
concentrates on the shelf and I still
[SPEAKER_00]: might pass on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is part of why I'm not smoking my
own concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another little branch to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see me growing a lot of flowers on
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of pictures of quality
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I am growing is loaded with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the seeded plants do not make
quality hash material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so beat up by the time I take the
seeds out of it that it is a waste of time
[SPEAKER_00]: for a concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: A concentrate maker could have ran quality
product and had much better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to waste their time on my
beat up seeded material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't have that made into
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is usually given to friends and they
turn it into edibles because they do it
[SPEAKER_00]: with their own small personal time,
their personal kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using a lot of big space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not wasting a lot of time,
not wasting anybody's energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I give it away to people and they make
edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what happens to the material from
the seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you do see me doing phenohunts
of my new seed runs because once I breed
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, the next step is to grow them and
see what I have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I take those buds with
me to events like the Indo Expo or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grow Show or whatever vending event
or community event or social event may be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bunch of cannabis to the fish
concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not bring any of the cannabis I took
with me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked every single bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is what happens to most of the
flower I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it to events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it to concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke and share it with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show up at my house and you're
like, I haven't had weed in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days, we'll make sure you leave here with
a couple of buds and stoned as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's what happens to my flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all those pictures of seeded
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that finger bang material gets given
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: People make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those buds you see from the phenohunt
runs, those nice photogenic buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke those with all of my friends at
the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had multiple jars on the table at the
Dude Grow's Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had multiple jars on the table at the
concentration celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had several jars on the table at the
Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke all of that cannabis with all of
my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's what happens to all of that
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got really carried away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took much longer than I had
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to jump right to the next
bullet point really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more testers is my next bullet point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently on the podcast, I mentioned that
I need some people to test a few new seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email inbox exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never gotten more emails and please
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found enough testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have read your email and not replied
yet because I got so many that I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtering through them and looking for my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be offended if I did not select you
as a tester this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are still in my potential testers
folder that I will go back to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future when I'm looking for more people to
test new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, big thanks and thank you to everybody
who responded and replied to my request
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to apply to be a tester of my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so many responses that it was
overwhelming and it was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still going through the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more messages every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening to this episode now,
please stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: My inbox is going crazy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just overwhelming and I'm never
going to catch up on all of the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you've sent me an email and I
haven't replied, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am digging through all of those emails
and I will get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a minute, but I will answer
every single message that has come to that
[SPEAKER_00]: inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank you for the overwhelming
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to add on to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have sent me a grow question,
a cannabis question, a cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: question, and I have not replied to you,
please do not get offended or frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a four-day vacation and I ended up
being about six days behind on emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how the fuck that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am always going to be about a day and a
half behind emails, it feels like,
[SPEAKER_00]: until we get a holiday and you guys all
take a day off and I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way I'm going to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you have not gotten a reply,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of you and one of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of the interaction and
all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast has gotten very popular in
the past few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: My listens have doubled in the past couple
of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you to all of
my friends who have shared the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: helped expand my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means a lot more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with the growth, I may slow down a
little bit on the personal replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my seed company, iRegenetics,
has been taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I have been getting even more emails
for that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grow From Your Heart podcast and
iRegenetics is all a one-man show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing, the breeding, the writing the
podcast, the producing, the editing the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, all of that stuff, the packaging
of the seeds is all done by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, please be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love and respect and I'm very thankful
and grateful for each and every person who
[SPEAKER_00]: supports iRegenetics and the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not feel like I'm ignoring you
or forgetting about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are just a lot of you to try to keep
up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, big thanks and much respect for making
my dreams come true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without you as an audience, without you as
my supporters, my dreams would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to forget about the people
who made this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, please do not ever feel like I
am skipping your email, like I'm ignoring
[SPEAKER_00]: your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to answer every message that is in
my inbox, but it is going to take me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of time to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, please continue to listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep sending messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will catch up and I will get to your
message in due time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I'd like to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to wrap up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently did an episode talking about
dab pens and smoking concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into that conversation again on the
Embracing Organics podcast live on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, where I was asked the question,
how do you politely decline somebody's dab
[SPEAKER_00]: pen or questionable concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in my position, in the cannabis
community, many people want to smoke with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people want to dab me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to find me at an
event and come to my booth and give me a
[SPEAKER_00]: dab just to show that they love me,
that they're my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to share their concentrate with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to show some respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also just want to say,
I dabbed with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect that and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes those people show up with
the scariest questionable concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do not want to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to remain friends with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't want to be a little anybody's
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they made that concentrate
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they grew the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're extremely proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to be the person who
tells them that is doo doo and I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody politely said, what is the
best way around that situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you how I handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you approach me and you have got some
dabs that I'm not really sure I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to say, hey, Rasta Jeff,
I brought you a dab and I'm going to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, man, let me check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at it and I'm going to
keep talking until you forgot that you
[SPEAKER_00]: offered me a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks pretty good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you make that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you let the flowers grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you flush it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've forgotten about the concentrate
a little bit and you're so focused on your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting excited while you're
getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to reach back and I'm going to
grab some of my Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Soul Cleanser from Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some India Pale from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab one of these and I'm
going to let you tell me about your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to open the lid and I'm
going to scoop up a pretty good dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're talking, I'm going to
heat up the dab nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the dab nail is the
appropriate heat, I'm going to hand you
[SPEAKER_00]: the dabber and give you the dab break and
go, hey, man, take a dab of this Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to take a dab and you're
going to go, I'm fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to forget you even
offered me a dab of your questionable
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and I'm out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep pressing, I may go,
oh man, I'm going to try some of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm just going to take a dab of mine
and then act like I forgot to dab yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to kind of switch it up
and get out of dabbing a questionable
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate is to pull out yours and
politely offer that person some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate and flip the script.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a salesman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwhelm their thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reprogram them that they want a dab of
your shit and they'll forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how I get around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of afraid to take concentrates
from other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am absolutely afraid to hit a vape pen
or a dab pen from a company I am not
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, if you offer me a
concentrate or a vape or maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, and I politely decline,
it has nothing to do with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has everything to do with popcorn lung
and me not trusting other companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: other makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have to be careful at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect your health.
