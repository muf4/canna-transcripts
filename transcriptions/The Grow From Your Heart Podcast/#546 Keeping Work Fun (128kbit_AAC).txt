[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Headbanger
Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Sour Diesel,
IBL, and Biker Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
sour and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have followed that up with
fucking delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor of this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour, the fuel, it is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I dab it, I get goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: High from this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack the jar open and let
you see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the four gram jar of batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked my way about halfway through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that's a beautiful golden
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the live batter from our
friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it does say
the product contains 63.97% total THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to our friends
at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous Headbanger Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a fun show lined up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to remind you that they have
started adding taxes to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of the things I offer on
Patreon are taxable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since all of the things I give you as
Patreon tiers as rewards are virtual,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all like thank yous and shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think those things will be
taxable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is based on your location, not my
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on where you are when you
contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to adjust all of the tiers to keep
things tax free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have to be honest and legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my best to keep it the same for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, however, increase the price of a
few tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk about this on a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to talk about it again,
because this will take effect by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new tiers on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting, I make promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you contribute to my Patreon,
I will do things for you to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the contributions, but I wasn't
able to keep up with my end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not getting their shout outs and
their questions read.
[SPEAKER_00]: To slow that down, I raised the prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally when you raise prices,
you sell less of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys just continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep sending me the extra funds that
will result in me doing extra podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already trying to find scheduling time
and energy to do another show every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some changes in the Patreon
and there may be changes coming up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast if the Patreon continues to kick
ass the way that it has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the kick ass Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am stoned and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to our friends at
Green Dot Labs for the delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: Headbanger live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking working.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the part where we are going to
do some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've invented a new club, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following folks have contributed
$7.10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a monthly contribution to the Patreon
campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to the 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's give some
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leader of the 710 club gets a shout
out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a giant shout out to my buddy,
Lemur Priest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump, big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need to follow that up with a big
giant dab and a high five and a thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for my friend, Paparoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need a big thank you shout out for
my buddy, Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need a big thank you shout out and
a high five for Easy057420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to follow that up with a giant
thank you shout out to my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackbird76.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a thank you shout out and
a high five for my buddy, FatRabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a giant thank you shout out to
my buddy, Lefty's Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support, Lefty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to send a giant thank you to my
buddy, Kes Burton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the work you're doing
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning a lot, but you are also
teaching a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for sharing the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to give a giant thank you
shout out to my friend, Ross Decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump, big thank you for all of
the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more grow questions,
please send those my way, Ross Decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am more than delighted to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's send a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend, Grow Man Stan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we need to send a big thank you
shout out to Zoso J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoso J, keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The awesome cannabis photography,
running some of my genetics, doing
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderfully, posting beautiful photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to send a giant Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you shout out and a fist bump and a
virtual dab to my friend, John K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, big thanks to everybody who is
supporting the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the support and I could
not continue to do the show the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do it without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it continues to go the way it is,
I will put out more content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to more content in the
future, because I've got faith you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the next order of business?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I should cover is musical
submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focused a lot of my time on catching up
on Patreon messages and questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been waiting for an email or
a reply via Patreon, I should have caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up with you by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you are probably next.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emails and musical submissions are
also being caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of great musical
submissions, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some out there that were a
little bit too much for an intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, if you're sending me music,
I've got to talk over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can't sound like trash cans and
trash trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can't be dubstep is what I think
I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is dubstep, mellow it down in a part
where I could talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make the robots battle all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think dubstep sounds like the toaster in
the microwave having a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's what you're into,
do your bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still reviewing the musical
submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple, a couple of guys
really get my vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've sent a couple emails out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked for permission to play one on the
show tonight, but it's a little bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do have permission to play the
samples, and I know what is expected of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we've worked some things out,
I will debut some really cool music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really cool digital music,
some really cool live music that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: produced for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I don't select the tracks as a
permanent start stop commercial type of
[SPEAKER_00]: track that I play in the show,
it still may end up being played on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show at least once so that you guys can
hear these people's hard work because
[SPEAKER_00]: people put some time into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make music myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay up all night long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't realize that the sun is coming
up and you've just got to get this fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sound perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need this one sound panned over to the
left just a little bit more than you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to go here in the car and make sure it's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate all of you folks who have
made and contributed music and tracks for
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, it's got to be an
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just remake another song.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't cut and paste other pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reviewing it and I will share some on
the show when I've got permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to Green Dot,
because they got me rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are charting in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get statistics from a couple of sources
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, and it's not called I can't
say the wrong terms because they've
[SPEAKER_00]: changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Apple podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the correct word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't call it iTunes anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Apple podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Apple podcasting app.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Jamaica, we are ranked very high in the
education category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep moving up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are ranking in the top 50 and top
25 in the education category in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to everybody on the island of
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to all the ganja farmers,
all the ganja learners, all the upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja growers, everybody out there on the
island who is dedicated and involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the legalization and the ganja movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you folks out there in Jamaica have any
questions, anybody has any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to hear from my Jamaican
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some emails, some questions to
grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if anybody has a grow question,
a cultivation question, a cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: question, grow from your heart at hotmail
.com is the way to reach me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Patreon puts you at the front
of the line, patreon.com forward slash
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I even said that part when I
did the Patreon rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already supporting the
podcast and you would like to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do so, visit patreon.com forward slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should pop up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I did put a link in the show
notes for all of the stone friends and for
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who have their hands full.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working, if you're driving,
just wait till you get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that link.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take you right to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that puts us back in rhythm,
back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to update you guys on what is
happening, you guys and gals and binary
[SPEAKER_00]: folk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep you updated on what is
happening in my personal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you know that I am running a Jack
the Ripper mail to make a Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: F2 experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I was heavily influenced by
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you were still here because I've
got some fucking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool had a lot of answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was miles ahead of me in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing the same thing I'm doing,
but he's faced a lot of the trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: tribulations and had a lot of the
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of the fucking answers that
I need right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish he was around, but I have got a
Jack the Ripper mail plant in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got four Jack the Ripper females in
a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have narrowed down my selections to
where I know which three Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: females I'm going to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers two and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make any difference to you,
but when I grew them, I labeled them one
[SPEAKER_00]: through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one happened to be the fucking best
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a stud from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it labeled at number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole project was based on finding a
JTR mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I labeled him number one, then I labeled
the next plant number two, the next one
[SPEAKER_00]: number three, the next one number four
down the line up to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they grew and looked shitty,
I got rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not shitty, but not up to my standards for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eliminated the not keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shunned the non-believers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was left with five.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a male and four girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five doesn't root well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think two and four are the keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think seven is the one that's
questionable that might stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grow it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, and four are the keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the champs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Jack the Ripper males,
some Jack the Ripper girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper male has successfully
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said in a couple episodes ago,
it looked like the pollination worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That room is seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pistols are brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crinkled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyxes are stuffed with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice and pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we pollinated?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hinting slowly on the show at
the strains that I've got in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting pollinated by the JTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I think I've mentioned there is
a rise plant in that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the idea of making the Jack the
Ripper cross was to cross Subcool's plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to one of my popular plants, which of
course would be the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a female Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have Arise X Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always list the ladies first when
you're listing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be Arise cross to Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I put a golden goat female in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that previously on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are sending me name suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll reveal some of those on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, of course, will reveal the names of
these crosses on the show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a golden goat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great name suggestions in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a blueberry cookies female in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have blueberry cookies cross to
the Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the blueberry cookies,
we're going to get the blueberry cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and potency, but I think the Jack
the Ripper is going to give it a more
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper that I've selected,
the phenotypes I'm finding in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bubblegum, strawberry sweetness,
maybe a watermelon sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think out of the blueberry cookies,
we're going to get strawberry and
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry skittles-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell Laffy Taffy when I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain smells the pink and purple Laffy
Taffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my brain thinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put a platinum tangy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That platinum tangy is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good breeder, but I've noticed
all of its offspring are not major monster
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if this Jack the Ripper will
make it bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going for for there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few more other ladies in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will reveal more of those as time goes
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to spill all of the beans
on one show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to keep you coming back for more
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a garden update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, all of those plants are
underneath a cannon, underneath two cannon
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights and a five by five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am loving the cannon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: After vegging one round under the cannon
LEDs, I went back to Keith and I bought
[SPEAKER_00]: three more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got five cannons running.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire veg space, my clone area,
my mom area is all cannon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish this flower run in a
small room with cannons and see how I like
[SPEAKER_00]: the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I completely approve with the seed
production and the way that everything
[SPEAKER_00]: goes and grows, so far we're halfway in
and I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that continues, I probably will replace
all of the lights in my personal flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: space with cannon LEDs or I'm going to try
to be really patient and get to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: tester for some of his new shit because I
heard there's new things coming down the
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not supposed to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Keith, getting you some hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we want to move forward from
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good time to segue into
the Patreon question for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got one email for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also works with another question that
another podcaster and fellow grower asked
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the email part that
was sent in by a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll also add on the other part that
my friend attached and then I will get on
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice little ramble here about this
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one comes from a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, hey, hey, just was high as hell
and wondered if growing commercially has
[SPEAKER_00]: taken the fun out of growing for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting on my new cannon to pop some
orangegasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kombucha makes me poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how the news goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking if growing commercially has
taken the fun out of growing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also said they're waiting for
their cannon LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person's got some cannons and some
orangegasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a good time with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the orangegasms under cannons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with that one cannon, you probably
want to run about a three by three,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a four by four space at the at the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that that light a little bit above
that ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the ceiling grows, get that light
closer and closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just excited that you've got my
genetics and a light grown by my friend or
[SPEAKER_00]: made by my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I recommend you get some new
millennium nutrients and you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: trifecta, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need a P.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: girl minder unit in that tent to make sure
everything's iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got iry genetics, a P.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: minder unit, if you've got a cannon light
and you've got some new millennium
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, you are setting yourself up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got the fucking Ferrari,
the key keys, the fast tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got cool paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready to shred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get my high ass back on track
because there was a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, kombucha makes me poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need that stuff sitting in there
for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably needed to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fix your your guts right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, has commercial growing taken the fun
out of growing for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because I won't let it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look like a serious dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look like a serious dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fucking dreadlocks to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a scruffy beard today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear a backwards hat and I'm fucking 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 41 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come across fairly serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can rely on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give the appearance,
the presentation that people can rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to give off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even being a stoner with dreadlocks and
whatever, I still like to give people
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence that I can get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I seem kind of serious, especially
being in charge, being the boss,
[SPEAKER_00]: being whatever, the lead grower,
the team leader, the cultivation director
[SPEAKER_00]: at a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can become stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the person between upper management
and the employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the employees fuck up,
I got to yell at them and it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like yelling at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my they're my buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dab after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang out and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also don't like getting yelled at by
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fucking it's a weird place to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't like being I don't like
being the disciplinarian kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't let it suck the fun out of it
because we are there to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the first person that shows up to
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the first person that shows up to
the front to select the music for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're the first grotech there,
you get to go in the back and you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: select music.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the first tremor there,
you get to go up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to select music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big divide between the two parts
of the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't hear tremor music when I'm in the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't hear grower music when I'm up
toward the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first person in each part gets to
select music that gives a person a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the music up loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you want to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you like 45 minutes of whatever
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's gangster rap, if it's hip hop,
if it's fucking Swedish country folk death
[SPEAKER_00]: metal, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want to hear and you
were first, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to switch it up for the
for the before break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to change it when we come back
from break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely going to be different when
we go to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll know after we go take a dab or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll know what to put on after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't let it suck the fun out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that all the guys I assign
tasks for multiple guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this guy doesn't really enjoy
doing this job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to walk by him every couple
of minutes and tell him he looks fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: good doing his job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows I'm fucking with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows I'm just fucking patronizing him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows he's doing a job that sucks,
but the boss is acknowledging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go check on every guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say I've got five guys growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them all doing separate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two guys are putting up trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy's doing transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy's cutting clones and one guy's
doing some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bounce through all the guys and make
sure they're all doing something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they don't need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they need help, I'll help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the guy's putting up trellis,
I'm 6'5".
[SPEAKER_00]: If they need a guy to go run fucking zip
ties down the poles, I'll zip tie the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're doing it, I'll fucking,
I hoot and holler like Ric Flair.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we accomplish something and we get
lunch 10 minutes early, you'll hear me go,
[SPEAKER_00]: woo!
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we get to go to lunch 10 minutes
fucking early.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you get two more dabs in is
what that really means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hoot and holler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking scream and yell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, let's get it done,
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grow some fucking weed
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just got to have a good time in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think keeping morale up really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go check on the guys hanging trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll go look at the guys
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're transplanting, I'll walk by.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look like they've fallen behind,
I'll catch them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do all the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get my hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a couple of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as I'm leaving, I go, man,
you guys look fucking sexy potting all
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just a couple of bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a lady, I won't say that because
I'll get myself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say you guys are kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look fucking great doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your shoes, something random.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what I'm doing, but it still
feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just sucking at work all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I go find the other guy who's
cleaning something or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I clean up a little bit for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just catch him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now his cleaning job doesn't suck as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, girl, you're a bad
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to clean that,
but you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not above anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off as the budtender,
as the tremor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm fucking that's everybody starts
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to fucking earn your spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just been there longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there longer than a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping it fun with music and just
being, I'm just a fucking jolly dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of got an unspoken rule that if
I can't tell you're high in the facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody else can and just shut up and be
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the minute we can tell you're high,
go fucking take a break, get some water,
[SPEAKER_00]: drink some sodas or eat some cookies,
get your shit back together, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to do to get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if nobody can tell you're high,
I don't know you're high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be mad at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an unspoken thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be blazed if you can be blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a break every couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just buy pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the guys are kicking ass and I see that
a couple, I know that we get paid every
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that around the end of that second
week, a couple of the guys, we go to lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks and their car doesn't leave the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cause they don't got no weed or no
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll buy pizza the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to keep those guys fucking fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One meal will get your fucking crew back,
back on your team and it prevents a mute
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Rick Flair and the fucking girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, whoa, all day long fucking,
you know, I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot sneak up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hasn't sucked the fun out of it
because I make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my job is to make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to do different tasks every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying I get to help all the guys at
different stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I get to do different shit
every single day and I learn new stuff by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionately curious is what I think
the term is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has not sucked the fun out of
growing for me because I just simply won't
[SPEAKER_00]: let it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's never going to stop being fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me segue into the second part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a live chat with my friend,
Scotty real and a few other folks and
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty real dropped a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, man, with all of the technology
and all of the things we have learned has
[SPEAKER_00]: growing become easier or harder for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of good answers
from me for that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at a level where I call myself a
black belt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't try to be egotistical about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't try to boast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that I'm confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a grow issue, a plant
issue, a commercial cultivation issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small grow issue, a breeding question,
I can probably cover and answer the
[SPEAKER_00]: question without much research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I got to go, I don't know,
let me check a couple of resources so I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't give you wrong details.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I know the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like a black belt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: With being a black belt grower,
there's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypothetically, I know how to throw a lot
of kicks and a lot of fucking blocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that also gives me a lot of decisions
to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kick and which block do I throw?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to make a decision on
the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really hope you block that right punch
and you don't get hit with a fucking left
[SPEAKER_00]: punch on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys follow my karate
analogies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking simple for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a black belt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is growing harder or easier now that
I'm a black belt grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been given, not given, but I've got
the controls, the keys, the driver's seat
[SPEAKER_00]: and the codes and the launch codes to
several large commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could make those facilities and those
jobs as hard as I wanted to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of shit to go wrong in a
commercial cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I train new people in a grow,
the first, usually they start in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hire and they come in about lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second day they meet me at the door to
go in at eight or nine in the morning or
[SPEAKER_00]: seven in the morning, wherever we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm turning off the alarm, I go,
okay, here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we do at every grow after
you turn off the alarm and clock in is
[SPEAKER_00]: find what went wrong last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds shitty, but there are a
lot of moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to find what the fuck went
wrong last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my facilities have five to 700
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pumps, there are fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every day we got to walk in and find
out what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's the hardest part of
commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, commercial growing is everything
you're doing at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixing nutrients, you can really make a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put in, if you do the math wrong,
if you're trying to add for 50 gallons,
[SPEAKER_00]: you accidentally do seven milliliters
times 50 instead of five, you just did a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more nutrients on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mistakes can be much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier, but it's also harder,
but I don't let it get too difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more parts you add, the more shit that
can break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep a commercial grow
reliable and self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to water by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: By hand, I like an auto watering system,
but it's not harder because I can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned to read the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes things a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned to calm the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grower panic button is much pressed,
less much often.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a new grower and I would see
something weird in the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the panic button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go, oh shit, I have to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to call six friends and find out
what they think I should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I go, huh, those leaves look like
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think about it and I solved the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the sense of my knowledge,
growing is much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of the technology shit can become
way difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got controllers and watering
controllers and light controllers and
[SPEAKER_00]: climate controllers and gigantic HVAC
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand most of the giant HVAC
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they break, that's hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hard part is maintaining all of
the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part is maintaining the staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part is maintaining scheduling
for rooms, employees, vacations,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, transplants, fucking inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hard part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a black belt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can handle 99% of what you throw at me
as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most of what I've said is relating to
a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, you would be surprised at
how much of a caveman grow I run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got vented lights with a carbon
filter and a blower blowing air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the vented light, out of a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my light setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1000 watt HPS lights for my breeding in my
main area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they may switch to the
cannons, but for now that's what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are plugged into the blue one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue control box, power box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the one that controls four lights
with the two accessory switches on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is set on 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is lifted up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so the plants aren't touching
the floor because I don't like my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floor gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them lifted up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low tech, three gallon pots,
fucking some sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do trellising in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I move the plants a lot, so I prefer the
sticks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my technology for my personal grow is
very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things that can really die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that could really break in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ballast could burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light bulbs could burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan could die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air conditioner could die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the power box could die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are about my major pieces of
equipment that I would have to replace or
[SPEAKER_00]: the PL minder units and they're telling me
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got a high temp shut off
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: My power box plugs into, so I've got a
piece that plugs into my main plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power box plugs into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The piece has a thermometer that hangs in
the middle of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the temperature exceeds a hundred
degrees, it cuts the power to everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything shuts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fans and the air conditioner may stay
on depending on how I've got the plugs
[SPEAKER_00]: configured.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my cooling will stay on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights will go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the lights don't continue to
roast the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly I've got the lights plugged into
that most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lights will turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll rescue the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll get a notification from the PL
minder unit that will say, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 105 degrees in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the fuck's happened in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can either drive home or I can walk to
the grow room and see what's going on and
[SPEAKER_00]: solve the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mainly like to keep it simple,
stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing can break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm spinning in the commercial grow,
we spend a lot of time cleaning filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning nozzles, cleaning sprayer jets,
cleaning the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of cleaning to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not harder, but it's more
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal grow, I've got an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a dehumidifier or a
humidifier in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the plants and the fucking rest of
the equipment kind of do that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of easy in my room to dial that
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the equipment do all the work for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I lost track of my fucking train
of thought there, but I don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can spend more time, not so much time
cleaning filters, cleaning shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just cleaning one air conditioner
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about really all I got to clean
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to mop the floor occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to fucking spray things down and
clean shit up and change the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I clean the glass, the glass between
the bulb and the fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little glass bulb in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heat stays in there and the air
moves it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean that quite frequently,
but there's not a lot of moving parts to
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives me so much more time to play
and focus on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to touch so much working
parts and machinery, less shit to break,
[SPEAKER_00]: less to replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps it more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does commercial growing suck the fun out
of it was the original question that got
[SPEAKER_00]: me triggered on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's stressful, but I keep it
fun in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I know that I get to come home and do
whatever I want in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to run around in there with no
clothes and no shoes and just my earbuds
[SPEAKER_00]: in my ears and listen to Joe Rogan talk
about aliens, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to wear my full on clothes just
to get that other image out of your head
[SPEAKER_00]: and my shoes and still have Joe Rogan in
my headphones, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to sit on a five gallon bucket
and smoke a joint, I don't smoke in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I wanted to, I could sit on a five
gallon bucket, smoke a joint, listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the fighter and the kid in my headphones
or on their fucking radio, nice and loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about anybody in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to cut down all these plants
because it looks like fun, I could cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to light them on fire,
we could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my own personal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll never quit having fun in my
personal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find two plants and I make them fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I make seeds and then I get to
grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like making packages of baseball cards
and looking for Mickey Mantles all day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm printing the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino hunts are fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching what you do with my seeds is a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send seed packs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys post them up on social media.
