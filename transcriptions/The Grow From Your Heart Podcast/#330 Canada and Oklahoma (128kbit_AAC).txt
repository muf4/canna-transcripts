[SPEAKER_01]: what we are smoking on mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you feeling over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Baked like a cake baked like a cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking this on the last episode you
guys were in love with it I'm in love with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the sinful banana sauce from
contraband concentrates That is the
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house concentrate company at a cut
above dispensary in colorado springs the
[SPEAKER_01]: sinful banana Sauce comes in at eighty
seven point eight percent THC a is a cross
[SPEAKER_01]: of cinnamon cookies and honey bananas And
this stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve it tastes really good,
but the other one hit me substantially
[SPEAKER_01]: harder I'm reaching for that one now to
talk about that That is the Durban kush
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce from the same company the same place
this one tested at ninety point three
[SPEAKER_01]: percent THC eight, but it's also got two
point one percent THC added to the label
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one didn't have that Listed so
that might be what's uh, what's giving you
[SPEAKER_01]: that extra punch?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one doesn't have any of that
stuff listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blank there So maybe that's what's
giving me the extra I don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: should be listed on the other container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that's doesn't make any sense to
me, but um Yeah, the Durban kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got that anise and licorice
super Durban-y smell to it I'm gonna pop
[SPEAKER_00]: it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that pine end to it,
but it's very Durban-y It seems like the
[SPEAKER_01]: kush took out that pine end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got sort of a sweet end to it like a
candy sort of a thing And that the look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the crystals in that one, bro Yeah,
big old chunky crystals in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was really pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Mike's dad was more than he needed
Yeah, it kind of ran him over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to go catch his breath go have a
cigarette I've been fiddling with this
[SPEAKER_00]: pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a hold me drowned into the world
guys only thing keeping you here in
[SPEAKER_01]: reality Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome back to earth Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a podcast about Legalization
legalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start here close to home first big
shout out to Oklahoma wait Way to go
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are legal now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I think it was Mike said two years
ago You guys are trying to sue us for
[SPEAKER_00]: having cannabis and now you were 2014
Oklahoma was part of a lawsuit suing
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado for our audacity to legalize
marijuana in The this week last week
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma legalized medical a more liberal
Legalization or medical law than any state
[SPEAKER_00]: since California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a list of qualifying
conditions A doctor can sign a
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for any condition he sees
fit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She sees fit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool So if they just say
yeah, you can have it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go Yeah, and on top of that they
can have three ounces in public Wow Wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can only have as a recreational patient
You can carry two as a or as a wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: patient carry one as a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can carry two So that's a little
different there you guys I just realized
[SPEAKER_01]: in the headphones you may be able to hear
my air conditioning It's a little clicky
[SPEAKER_01]: floppy jingly sound In the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to filter that out with some
compression here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uh, it's a hundred and four degrees
You guys have to just let me have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditioning in the background today,
but we'll try not to complain too much
[SPEAKER_00]: It's after nine o'clock at night and it's
still over 90 degrees outside here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to this shit Yeah, I got it up
on high still I just reached down to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: up the the compressor on the audio
equipment I was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pretty much where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna if it goes any higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna start cutting out That's why
you hear our voices get short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the end of the words don't
finish It's really got the compressor up
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're just gonna have to deal with
that sound of that air in here a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit because it is hot you guys so Oklahoma
welcome to the medical marijuana club You
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to have any qualifying
conditions to go get your medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as the doctor there feels like you
can do it You can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys that are listening to this
show my friends My friend my friends you
[SPEAKER_01]: have got a head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got an education.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got basically Kind of a course in
how to go listen in for a while You've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a big jump on most of the other people in
your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go go be a part Of this new
revolution go be a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go be a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go be a grow tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go be an extraction coordinator There are
so many different positions to fill in
[SPEAKER_01]: that industry And if you don't want to be
involved with the packaging labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing sales distribution so much of
that Also security I was gonna say they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be ancillary businesses that pop up
You're gonna smoke shops if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: another business like if you're a
contractor or tradesman HVAC to start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah HVAC techs Electricians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, you're gonna need somebody they're
gonna need somebody that can drive a
[SPEAKER_01]: forklift in their new facilities But what
I'm saying is go get in there and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: head start and also if you're not gonna be
involved in the weed industry Maybe open a
[SPEAKER_01]: head shop So many head shops are gonna pop
up open up a grow store Open up all the
[SPEAKER_01]: logs and go along with it lodging because
now more people are gonna be coming there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not recreational So it's not gonna
have as much impact as it did here because
[SPEAKER_01]: people come here to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's But container places places that
make containers for the product when we go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the conventions here a good portion of
all of the booths are simply Medical
[SPEAKER_01]: approved containers that we can retail our
products in so maybe have a container
[SPEAKER_01]: company They're gonna need representatives
for their companies that will drive around
[SPEAKER_01]: up and down the state or you're a square
so all over the state and call rushes one
[SPEAKER_01]: highway you go up and down all day long
and you go sell products up and down that
[SPEAKER_01]: highway, but You're gonna want to drive
around your state and represent your
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's your niche but find your way
In there if not in the industry itself in
[SPEAKER_01]: an ancillary business if you're not
Comfortable or allowed to get in that
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you just want to be on the fringe
get an ancillary business That's a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things that will be
involved with cannabis becoming legal Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some more notes over there about
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not especially Okay, I I wanted to get
a little more in depth, but I did not I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saving some of the commentary for after we
do Canada for after we do Canada Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's a good segue I guess there's a
lot that a plot that I want to say that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot that applies to both locales But
Canada legalized y'all Canada's going
[SPEAKER_00]: legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they talked about it a long time ago
and now they are doing it Canada has
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized cannabis It was a campaign
promise that they carried through on and
[SPEAKER_00]: on October 17th Marijuana will be legal
across the country It's split up into
[SPEAKER_00]: provinces just like provinces just like
the US is split up into states and Just
[SPEAKER_00]: like the US every province is gonna have
their own laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like completely I've got some
outline of some of the basic rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it looks like it's gonna vary pretty
heavily from one part of Canada to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next State-run stores in one part couple
hundred stores that are privately owned in
[SPEAKER_00]: another no stores in another Wow Some
areas allow commercial grows some areas
[SPEAKER_00]: don't some areas allow home grows some
areas don't Some legalized for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: when they turn 18 Alberta in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be legal once you turn 18 all other
Provinces, it won't be legal until you're
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 I know the anti pot groups are just
shocked that they didn't go with 21 like
[SPEAKER_01]: we did right right and 18 and 19 is weird
to have two different ages because what if
[SPEAKER_01]: you are 19 and You have your weed and you
drive across state lines like oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta throw my weed out the window now
Yeah, I just can't take it with you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess That's we have similar problems
here, but that's so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an age difference Yep for plants
per household.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like but it depends again on your
area Quebec and Manitoba specifically have
[SPEAKER_00]: already banned home grows completely like
all forms of homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow Canada's got an interesting
cannabis history They basically went
[SPEAKER_00]: through what Pueblo is going through now
or ours part of Colorado is going through
[SPEAKER_00]: now with all the illegal home grows They
did that in the early thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we learned a lot of what we Know
from Canada a lot of people remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: ice out in Canada power went out for a
long time in Canada and people were
[SPEAKER_01]: managing grows and that was a huge thing
that we were paying attention to on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet at that time and Then after that
a lot of things went wrong and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Canadian grows got in trouble That's
where the Romulan comes from you guys is
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada Romulan is a Canadian strain When I
was in college all of us came down from
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada but Their history with it's a
little different than ours their politics
[SPEAKER_00]: was way different than ours, so They went
about this a very different way than the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they did Yeah, they definitely did
the age difference that just automatically
[SPEAKER_01]: before it even starts just no home grows
in some places That's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they they wanted us the The
government wanted to do this early summer
[SPEAKER_00]: was when they wanted to roll this out and
they delayed it till October to give all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different little local governments a
chance to weigh in and hash all this Out
[SPEAKER_00]: and figure out how they wanted to play it
Local control was kind of a big piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: this from what I see Isn't that kind of
the opposite of how we do it here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: States in the States?
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of say hey, we've got this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna make these new rules Go and
then you go and then along the way they
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we didn't see that rule We're gonna
have to dial that in and they just go make
[SPEAKER_01]: a new yes So they seem to have gotten it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we don't agree with everything
roll out slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it seems to have worked better
They have some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish we had That would make this
rollout easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do they have national health care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah that simplifies this shit a lot
They're known for being more just chill
[SPEAKER_00]: more polite and That helps their politics
like their politics follow suit a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit at least in the national media I've
never been to Canada for more than like 15
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes So since the medical industry
isn't going to lose business because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a business in Canada as much as it is
here They're not lobbying against
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana as much as what you kind of said
I haven't followed this that closely but
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much all the the marijuana and
Entities in Canada that I follow have been
[SPEAKER_00]: at least generally in support of this
change Some of the longtime activists are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting really pissed right now because
like new politicians are like look what we
[SPEAKER_00]: did and they're like go fuck yourself
We've been fighting for this for 30 years
[SPEAKER_00]: and now you're doing it in a way that kind
of excludes us and so that some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: factions are starting to get a really
pissed but A lot of those people at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time have been really really really
pushing the envelope for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we got here and I can't fault
them for continuing to do what got us here
[SPEAKER_00]: Like without them we wouldn't be here
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be here Canada wouldn't be
legal Oklahoma wouldn't have just gone
[SPEAKER_00]: medical but For the most part Like just
having a more calm political system that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to have Discussions in an adult
manner that we're not able to have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, things are we automatically go to
the extremes Yes, like when you bring up
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legalization, you're
automatically talking about Teenagers
[SPEAKER_00]: getting stoned and killing people on the
highway and rape and white bitches or it
[SPEAKER_00]: causing schizophrenia or Like you just
immediately the conversation is extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is more Reno doubt instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep There was a lot less of that pretty
much the only big anti marijuana group up
[SPEAKER_00]: there Sam Canada and they're a fucking
horrible export of ours They just have
[SPEAKER_00]: even less support up there than they do
here So they're mostly all about it and
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada has been pretty pretty relaxed on
marijuana laws from what I understand in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past anyway Yeah for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting Beasters delivered in high
school years ago Just coming down from
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada just flooding it in good old
Canadian weed to get FedEx to my door My
[SPEAKER_00]: mind but like that's the guy I Purchased
from you see it FedEx from fucking Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wonderful I had friends up in
Oregon and Washington that were showing up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado with that way back in the day
They've been fighting a good fight for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and it's they're the only the
second nation to go nationally After
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay, they're going with a totally
different system So again, like I'm kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cheese because we're gonna get a whole
new data set now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of fun One of the upsides
to the anti pot crowd is Canada is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have more data collection from the onset
Nobody here considered to do it like After
[SPEAKER_00]: a holiday like st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick's Day like by the Wednesday after
st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick's Day the newspaper has the DUI
results from across the state Like here
[SPEAKER_00]: here it is broken down by County.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were six people in Denver There were
two people in Douglas like you can see it
[SPEAKER_00]: easy Because it took mothers against drunk
driving fighting for 20 years to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: system built when we legalized weed like
two years later though, like You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have a system like that for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any idea what's going on We
haven't been dealing with this is so just
[SPEAKER_00]: recently there's they've started to try to
collect that data And it's given the anti
[SPEAKER_00]: pop people a chance to be like look this
there were no cases last year in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: this year There's 900 cases and it's like
the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we didn't write it down last year We
didn't know there was a test on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never took notes But they're not gonna
have that advantage in Canada and the data
[SPEAKER_00]: Collection is gonna be not complete but
more so there from the outset which is fun
[SPEAKER_00]: for people like me It's the upside to
legalization like the more research that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens on it the better an idea it
becomes Yes, and then we can see data and
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers and then we have tangible evidence
to pass on to the next people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do it like Most people don't
really realize how permissive And
[SPEAKER_00]: infectious our prohibition laws have
become over the decades how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: American society they've infected and
eroded and fucked up and fucked with and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's what that's continued to do what
the ripples from that have done and
[SPEAKER_00]: Undoing it in even a little way is good
like earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a Instagram live video and someone
asked me what the worst part of Colorado's
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization is and I couldn't think of an
answer like there are parts that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: annoying than others, but there's not one
single part of our Incomplete fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: over restrictive legalization law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't prefer to its prohibition
counterpart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Do you I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to make a transition I came from the
black market much more so than I did my
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there there was a lifestyle
change They came with legalization When
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant was illegal so it that's back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's Long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel uncomfortable saying this you
guys where we live Several years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be too specific weed would cost four
thousand dollars a pound now where we live
[SPEAKER_01]: weed cost Fifteen hundred twelve hundred
dollars a pound for the same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why yeah, just kind of yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no one's gonna buy it anyway
inside the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even worse you places like Oregon
right now They so overproduced and they so
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted the distribution market that
The price is falling off the floor like
[SPEAKER_00]: Well imagine now but legalization did the
same thing to the black market and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the points is it's an economic
weapon against the black market if I were
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue trying to grow as a lifestyle
my product is worth a quarter of what it
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be so it means I get to live a
quarter of the way I used to means I get
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat a quarter of the Thai food I used
to eat that means I get to buy a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: of the door you have to do a hundred fifty
percent more or you have to jump into the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal industry because you've got
experience and you've got know-how and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what to do With it, you know how to
get in there and lead it and you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of people Yeah, that was the way to
do it to be confident and go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: crush it that way No, most of the people
that tried to just do a hundred fifty
[SPEAKER_00]: percent more illegal shit can't bust it
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, I used to have a house decked
out with lights and I got a t5 and a
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering light It is it's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less stressful being legal Well Mike,
I feel like I bombarded your your Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: report You got any more notes on Canada
that you want to get covered before I
[SPEAKER_01]: start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically but okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next piece of this like it's
awesome that Canada is going legal now and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's awesome the Oklahoma with medical But
now like a lot of the nitty-gritty work
[SPEAKER_00]: begins If you're not already active in
local government Get active if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: already following local state province
country news Start following it now
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you'll wake up in the
legalization law Will be written to
[SPEAKER_00]: exclude everybody except people that can
come in with several million dollars and
[SPEAKER_00]: open a corporation Colorado pushed out all
the small growers because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about small-time black market
grows Becoming legal and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: walking a fine line between legal and
illegal so they made You upfront invest as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as they could get away with making
you up and invest to put that guillotine
[SPEAKER_01]: or around you And now that all the quality
is going down because it's just ran by
[SPEAKER_00]: money There's no more passion the the
quality took a huge hit here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: in Generally, you can still find what I
consider the best herb on the planet If
[SPEAKER_00]: you take your time to go to the right
places and shop around and get what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking for but there's a lot of
crap a Lot of crap available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and it sells unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunately most people that are in
this Just for money when they look at
[SPEAKER_00]: their bottom line the the first thing they
cut is talent His talent cost a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it do and they can get their cousin
to do the checklist that the talent made
[SPEAKER_00]: and They think it's the same thing and
it's not they find they find out after a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of crops that quickly becomes
apparent So we were talking about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into getting in now getting involved now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is an easy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's what's the first step?
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with reading like you have a
local newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the the news agency that's going
to be covering Zoning rules in your area
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow rules in your area Zoning for
stores if all that hasn't been finalized
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the Government agencies making all
those decisions and for the most part you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just look up the meeting time and show
up and If you do that a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of sit back And observe you
can figure out what the little easy
[SPEAKER_00]: process is To go speak in front of that
body and say whatever you want They've
[SPEAKER_00]: almost universally got some sort of public
forum spot During their regular meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can get up there and rail about
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're passionate about And that's the
easiest way to really start getting Their
[SPEAKER_00]: attention you can also email all these
people call all these people Local elected
[SPEAKER_00]: officials get paid to make random people
in the public happy That's how they keep
[SPEAKER_00]: their job is Making enough people in in
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They serve wander around and go Hey,
do you know about Bobby down at the state
[SPEAKER_00]: house?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so helpful that way they keep their
job And so when people call them during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day nine times out of ten they answer
and it's just like hello I'm your local
[SPEAKER_00]: elected official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do you for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if they disagree with you nine
times out of ten They're fairly polite and
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful and they're like, well,
I disagree with that But if you talk to my
[SPEAKER_00]: co-count, you know co-commission or
so-and-so, you know I think he's more
[SPEAKER_00]: receptive to this and he'll be more
willing to help you get whatever you want
[SPEAKER_00]: done or submitted in front of our
committee or Council they could pass you
[SPEAKER_00]: along to the right person at least
hopefully but it starts with just reading
[SPEAKER_00]: the news and following these stories and
going to the meetings and sitting back and
[SPEAKER_00]: observing and honestly not enough people
do it the people that go are the handful
[SPEAKER_00]: of people like me that are passionate
about it for some weird sort of broken
[SPEAKER_00]: childhood reasons and the people who were
my exact opposite and against it and those
[SPEAKER_00]: are the people that tend to dominate the
meat and I finally snapped at one meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: and was like no I can't let people who
can't formulate an entire sentence Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who that is you to speak for my
community like he doesn't represent me at
[SPEAKER_00]: all He's representing my community badly I
can do a better job guaranteed even as
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous as I am and I started getting up
and speaking and It was terrifying the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time I was on the front page of the
local paper like it's annoying as much
[SPEAKER_00]: hate I get from the anti-pot crowd down
here But is worth it like without what I
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have what we have in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true It just took me doing
like it just took one of me to get most of
[SPEAKER_01]: what we have in Pueblo I went to several
of those City Council meetings and the
[SPEAKER_01]: first couple I was just hanging out and
attending and it was nerve-racking I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just just there I wasn't even speaking I
wasn't doing anything but after the second
[SPEAKER_01]: or third one you get the flow you see how
it goes you hear people speak and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that everyone that goes up and
speaks is just a working-class person that
[SPEAKER_01]: just wants some shit in the community to
be different and that's they May be
[SPEAKER_01]: judging you because what you're asking for
is cannabis related But at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got to hear you and you are Their
community so they'll listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just go a few times Get it figured out
find out where you fit in and then speak
[SPEAKER_01]: one day and when you speak other people
that are passionate will see you speak and
[SPEAKER_01]: guys like myself will walk up to you and
go hey, bro, can you Like teach me like
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't want to go be involved so
much because I look like this and I do
[SPEAKER_01]: this But it'd be cool to have some
knowledge and then you'll start finding
[SPEAKER_01]: like-minded folks and you'll start falling
in with the right right folks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get it figured out when I first got
started going would just watch by the
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth or fifth meeting like Elected
officials were coming up to me after the
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting and going like why are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not to be rude or like to encourage
you not to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Like you're not one of the
crazies You're not paid you're not media
[SPEAKER_00]: and you haven't gone got like freaked out
about whatever Local rule or call this
[SPEAKER_00]: fascists or anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like why are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just calmly like I'm I've got an
issue that's important to me that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up from in front of council and I wanted
To get a feel for the meetings and like
[SPEAKER_00]: cool Like they don't that they're
interested that you're interested is all
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, even if they disagree with you
They're glad you could put a coherent
[SPEAKER_00]: argument together because if you go to a
few of these and watch There'll be three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four crazy people that have the public
speaking rules on lockdown and go every
[SPEAKER_00]: week to rail and like Call your local
elected officials fascists and bitch about
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're taking away your rights
because it's an always hot whole ordinance
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always one elderly person bitching
about the same fucking thing for the past
[SPEAKER_01]: eight years in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep I've had to turn my mic off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to talk for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do a dab I've had the same
really nice lady Come and ask me to stand
[SPEAKER_00]: up in solidarity when she asks me to in
you know Who in the crowd wants to impeach
[SPEAKER_00]: the council with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like I need everybody to stand up
when I say that And she'll go to everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: in the meeting and spend like an hour
talking to people and then nobody will
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up She's done that like a hundred
times Just go and watch and when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: making a coherent argument you can see
their faces light up like People dying of
[SPEAKER_00]: thirst being offered water Okay,
because it's a lot of nonsense and when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not total nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculously specific legal jargon
That gets read aloud by somebody with a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice that's designed to put people to
sleep usually and so They just latch on to
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're saying and I was able to
turn seven people who are definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: against me into five people that were with
me in like two months of just going down
[SPEAKER_00]: and using a three-minute window to point
out economic benefits of legalization and
[SPEAKER_00]: I Wasn't using anything that I didn't
Google If you're not good at asking Google
[SPEAKER_00]: the right questions hit me up online and I
will help you Like that's really all it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they help?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they hit you up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me at Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws and Facebook or at nemo punk
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 on Twitter Nice to have buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the German or the bananas?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is neither green dot labs Screaming
Scout full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be something screaming and
Girl Scout cookies and it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Or a weird Fino with a loud scout I
Wish I'd start putting further genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: information on the label me too It's just
shit you and your boy's name feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: write that too I Respect that more than
just putting shenanigans on the side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the package It's just straight sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just gonna get it's like just a
liquid dab is all it well There's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: turp in there a little diamond in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh This is gonna kill you that needs to be
heated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah So yeah, we came to a pause in
the show How is how is Canada changing How
[SPEAKER_01]: is this going to affect us in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada's bit when Uruguay legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll heat that for you When Uruguay
legalized the West went so Who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like cute little old man president.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay Like all nine of your people have
legal weed now good for you Like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: literally how the West reacted and there
were a couple of anti-pop people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: like this will not stand the UN Convention
of 1910 but for the most part No one gave
[SPEAKER_00]: a fuck But Canada's major they're a major
US trading partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We share a huge border They're in all the
summits They participate in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: international committees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of our major partners in
everything This impacts a lot and Stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that it doesn't directly impact they're
gonna provide us all the data that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: for legalization everywhere Colorado is
doing that but it's harder to find I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a feeling that Canada is gonna be really
upfront and loud and proud about this
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they've got universal health care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can track some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't all right a little better and A
lot of like that's what I'm really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to about Canada's legalization
like I've got legalization here I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to travel to enjoy it right y'all
want to give me a killer job in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to get a green card We need we
need to get some passports because a
[SPEAKER_01]: hockey puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they call it there We've
both I I know that I've been requested My
[SPEAKER_01]: presence has been requested in Canada to
help get some things going so I know I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to try Tim Hortons for our Canada
listeners But I don't know anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: about Canada other than I love all the
people I've met from there What was I
[SPEAKER_01]: taunted with poutine and French women is
what I think I yeah, right They said come
[SPEAKER_01]: get some poutine and French women and I
was like, well that sounds like a win-win
[SPEAKER_00]: situation for me There's a lot about
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd enjoy everything But the weather I
think right now I could go for some fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say it's fucking a hundred
degrees Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a random chatter I lived
in Lawrence, Kansas and I knew a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: kids from from Canada Some of the coolest
fucking kids I hung out with so one dude
[SPEAKER_01]: was a drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a huge Neil Pert fan He said boss
diesel a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was pretty funny That's my
Canada story and I'm sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so since Mike is gonna choke
for a couple of minutes I've got an email
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think I should read and now is
probably the best Time I'll leave Mike's
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone on just so that you can hear
him over there I'll put him about halfway
[SPEAKER_01]: if he decides to talk I'll turn him up
This email comes from our Canadian friend
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's perfectly timed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he wants his name said
we'll get to that part It says hey Ross
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian friend actually says his name in
the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says hey, what up Rasta Jeff squishy
McRoz in here I'll just get right to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot express enough how thankful I am
for your show after listening I realized I
[SPEAKER_01]: had to stop and reassess everything I was
doing not just in my garden, but in my
[SPEAKER_01]: life I was growing illegally Putting my
family at risk and doing nothing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis knowledge I had So this dude
realized one day probably because I said
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna get fucking rated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said that on the show He thought oh,
man, they'll shoot my dog and take my
[SPEAKER_01]: kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun games So they shoot your fucking
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth as soon as that front
door comes off life sinks in quickly Trust
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says since listening to you and your
amazing guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's you Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've stepped up my game I've become
determined to be a positive light for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis sharing information with anyone
that will Listen, you have given me the
[SPEAKER_01]: tools to break down barriers and
communicate with the people about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: who are otherwise uninformed People are
overwhelmed with the amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: information I am able to clearly
articulate to them and I've never had a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative response I have sought out a
company aimed to assist people in getting
[SPEAKER_01]: people safe access to cannabis in Canada
They're helping me through the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: obtaining a personal production license I
am now able to confidently and clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: express how and why I use cannabis to
doctors, which is something I would not
[SPEAKER_01]: Have been able to do before He says from
your episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to build a cannabis tailored
resume and obtain a position at a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: producer So we got another person This is
the second person that I've gotten an
[SPEAKER_01]: email from recently that we got we helped
them get a job in the cannabis industry He
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on to say I've also gotten involved
in my local cannabis community attending
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Sorry, the I the computer just said
their updates available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that way later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it we're gonna have to tell it
later because Apple will just keep begging
[SPEAKER_01]: remind me tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep moving with the email He says
I've also gotten involved with my local
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community attending public
cannabis information sessions and I
[SPEAKER_01]: participated in several government
Engagement surveys to ensure my voice is
[SPEAKER_01]: heard excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's on the right path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job squishy He goes on to say
recreational cannabis will be legal here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada in 8 to 12 weeks And I am proud
to have been a part of the process Here's
[SPEAKER_01]: the part where it gets cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says I believe that you Have also
contributed indirectly because without the
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance of you and white Mike I wouldn't
have I would not have gotten involved So
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a little bit of a little bit of the
tickle there on Canada doing their thing

[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm gonna follow Canada pretty closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've I've seen some concerning press
already where I'm like, oh really that had
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen already and I've seen some stuff
from like fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Canada And I've almost never said
that in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a definitely a cool time for
Canada Oklahoma as well, you know Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one I may have two more questions
for you depends on how long we go on this
[SPEAKER_01]: one question How long until we're
federally legal here in the states now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think about it would take us
about another decade about another decade
[SPEAKER_00]: if you follow politics at all,
you know that Everything that was true on
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday is true anymore That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a banana attic time where we're
led by an orange crazy person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes So ten years you think I'd be down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would be cool with I would be
satisfied with seeing So many so many
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are in play on this particular
question are up in the air right now That
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't true under any of the previous
presidencies or any other time in our life
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna add that the deciding factor
is probably the next two presidential
[SPEAKER_00]: elections is what would decide that the
midterms are gonna be insanely important
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next presidential is gonna be
huge It'll be huge and the presidential
[SPEAKER_00]: after that will also be huge Yeah By the
time the next presidential happens Like
[SPEAKER_00]: another Supreme Court seat will be there
open or damn near close we just had one
[SPEAKER_00]: open up this week Senate population
changes rapidly right now we just saw like
[SPEAKER_00]: a legit fucking socialist when The person
who was gonna take over for like the
[SPEAKER_00]: ranking Democrat they were the next in
line for the throne Got defucking thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: in a primary to like a 28 year old unknown
chick with like a super immigrant II name
[SPEAKER_00]: like she had a long fucking hill to climb
and Just home run home run home run home
[SPEAKER_00]: run won the fucking election nice and
right now That and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things along with President Trump and all
of those everything Like I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into it too much and make this show
super political But a lot of shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: would affect federal legalization
happening or not happening is all up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air right now The hardcore members of
the Senate that are against it might not
[SPEAKER_00]: have jobs in six months or a year 18
months The people that are for it also
[SPEAKER_00]: might not have jobs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right everyone could switch President
Trump could fucking legalize it through
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of bizarre decree Or he could
start really pushing the Senate to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper way Or he could get impeached
like this could go a lot of or he could
[SPEAKER_01]: get a ways people or he could fucking just
OD on diet pills one day it's The world is
[SPEAKER_00]: a very strange place right now and in
predicting something like federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization that's gonna take so many
different acts of law and Like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: tough, but I wouldn't expect it anytime
soon Definitely don't invest money
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow based on it happening soon one
more one more thing I kind of want to
[SPEAKER_01]: touch on that I honestly have no education
on but I know that this is a thing
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere along the line when Canada
legalizes can has legalized cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: when the states finally legalized
federally what sort of International rules
[SPEAKER_01]: or treaties are we breaking because I've
heard there's Russia mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a major UN convention that says
You can't legalize basically narcotics
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs of abuse and enjoyment If it's not
very you can't legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's a policy that the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really really pushed like it's basically
ours that we forced on the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world The rest of the world was happy to
jump on our bullshit, so it's not all our
[SPEAKER_00]: fault, but it's all our fault So we let
the grenade and now we're falling on it
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves There's a number of countries
that have called us on it in the in the UN
[SPEAKER_00]: and call us out on our shit like hey You
push this on everybody and now Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: and Washington fucking did what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they say it in German.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knows it happened but It did happen and
it's happened repeatedly It just hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: had much of an impact yet the anti-pop
people bring it up every now and then Like
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be in violation of a UN convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like well fucking Russia invaded a
country and we Just kind of chilled just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know one's gonna like Fucking cut us
off trade because we legalized weed Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I saw a headline while I was
skimming through doing a quick a little
[SPEAKER_01]: check that Russia was already offended
that we're doing it Well, that's Canada's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that we're really
gonna see with Canada now like no one
[SPEAKER_00]: really cared when Uruguay did it and their
global Impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's substantial for Uruguay,
but it's not substantial for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other major countries, especially when
compared to Canada Like they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: comparable trading partners as far as I've
aware in any way And so when Canada does
[SPEAKER_00]: this a lot a lot of people who were able
to completely ignore Uruguay doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot at all ignore Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes much more sense All right You got
any more for Canada want to make sure we
[SPEAKER_00]: let you know Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go way to go Canada We'll quit
making making fun of you smoke a joint and
[SPEAKER_01]: watch the monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess the most horrible thing I've
said I guess we're not gonna make quit
[SPEAKER_00]: making funny because Mike had one more
burn to throw at you I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I know it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are a lot of issues with it I
know some of the penalties for going
[SPEAKER_00]: around or outside of the limits are just
as harsh or harsher than they are now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Trust me give it a few minutes
participate make sure that the laws the
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning the distribution stuff the
conversation around it is rational and
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be a lot happier With legalization
than you ever were with prohibition.

[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friend Nontoxic Yogi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for all the love
and support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got
something you'd like to say and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: into all that social media stuff,
or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you've got a product you'd like me
to review, whatever, if you'd like to just
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of emails that need to get
caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been packing the show with grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get back to emails pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys seem to have been loving the grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast is ranked 635 out of 40,000
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must be doing something right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep going the way we're
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get back to emails pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll blend some of those in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you can listen to the podcast on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can listen to the show on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm working with Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told me one way to try to fix the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit didn't work, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sending them emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize that the Stitcher application
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, you figured out that you can
listen to it on the Stitcher website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use the app.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can go to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put every single episode on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a Stitcher listener who's converted
to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of listens on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys continue to listen on YouTube,
I will improve the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds like I'm bargaining
with you, but I've got more time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I see that that's a thing, I will do it
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see that it gets response,
I will improve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes a lot of time to make
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make these high quality
videos and have YouTube jack my channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they gave Custom Grow back his
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving people back their channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bolted pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was enough though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the other benefits of being
a whole country being legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an issue anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat you're going to take for getting
up and standing up and saying the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: around this should be rational.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your message, the heat you're
going to take for that is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you stand up and do that in a
prohibition area, the heat you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take for that can be pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all make the YouTube videos better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start putting more images in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like recording my face and doing
the show like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really don't like doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll do more of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get enough YouTube interaction,
maybe we'll start doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening
to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike's wife, if you ever happen to
listen to the podcast, thanks for letting
[SPEAKER_01]: me borrow your husband for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bring him over here and he gets high as
shit and rambles for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, thanks, wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys do what you can do to get
cannabis legalized in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get active, get loud, get your voice
heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can go to a public meeting and
listen or talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can write a letter to their local
paper and have it published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free content for the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking publish everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't show up to the city council meetings
blazed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put on a colored shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Represent us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comb your hair, if that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean durag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, comb your hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, for 99% of the population,
those words aren't a fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to remember that it's not just us
talking on here so I don't advocate crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not the type of person who's
comfortable public speaking and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: more comfortable writing an email,
the newspaper can't look you up and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, fucking Donnie Brasko, don't live
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make up a decent nom diploma or a
pen name and send a letter to your local
[SPEAKER_00]: paper advocating legalization under a
pseudonym, that's not a crime and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be more than happy to publish it if you
use appropriate language and make rational
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email local officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow this stuff and be informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes up in conversation,
enlighten the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're one of the people like me
who knows way too much about weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things I found helpful with
non-weed people is ask them how much they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have a tendency to dump truck
unload our information onto people and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, I just wanted some weed
that'll my girl will like she said go buy
[SPEAKER_00]: his weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at the weed store by Clementine for
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now I know, you know, a master's
degree worth about weed and she's pissed
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm at the store for an hour and a
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, just ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys get yourselves active
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always say this every time if you're
going to be involved in writing,
[SPEAKER_01]: making, creating the rules of legislation
around cannabis in your area, please
[SPEAKER_01]: include some more to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nowhere to smoke legally here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us, dude, how about a smoking park
and outdoor smoke park?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Mike just nodded his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a dog park for stoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bunch of dudes kicking around a
hacky sack throwing a frisbee smoking a
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're a cat, people don't go to
this park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, you're not discriminating
against cats, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we could nonsmokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have a park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd make us put up fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see through it running outside
the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool with that, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we can be outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a picnic table and a couple of chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it like smoking lounges in the
airport 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do include some sort of smoking
consumption area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I joke a lot, but an outside smoke
park, maybe an inside, like somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can go kick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will set up different smoke
lounges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the places I eat have an outdoor
patio area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it when we could go to different
places and smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the Kana, the Kana Canyon was
set up real classy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was painted kind of, I mean for a smoke
lounge, for what we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was painted in nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent modifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was decorated by a yoga chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very yoga chick like in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it felt kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had hardwood floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had some Ikea couches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were paintings on the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: The walls were good colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the real deep couches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no TVs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no loud music and it was chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then right across town was the dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got pool tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got fucking a stage with comedians
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of like a night bar kind of
place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right across town is the A64
where they actually turned an old bar into
[SPEAKER_01]: a smoke club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where there's a bar and people are just
sitting at the bar smoking, watching the
[SPEAKER_01]: game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly just dudes our age,
smoking a joint, watching the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, can I get another
pre-roll?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the girl up there just passes them
pre-rolls and they charge it just like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting another drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just sit up there and smoke pre-rolls
and dabs and watch the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: People freak out about that concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like we already have an
infrastructure built for people to gather
[SPEAKER_00]: at a location, become intoxicated and have
someone else deliver them home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fucking invented that shit for bars and
football games and literally every other
[SPEAKER_00]: event, adults gather in groups of more
than three.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason we can't do this with
weed other than people are uptight about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should hear the conversations around
this topic in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going crazy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely need somewhere for locals
and visitors to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got really close to having that and our
latest attempt just failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, again, again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we're about to wrap up
the show and we got super rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a bunch of good sativa dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Durban poison and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thanks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all the interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: My emails, my Twitter, my Facebook,
my Instagram, my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has been blowing up lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hela Dank Seed Company has been going
crazy lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been changing my life to be more
available for what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this podcast is part of what I want to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is heavily what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for supporting my endeavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the support from all my friends
and family, my listeners, my network,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be able to live the way I
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you guys and I love you
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wrap up the podcast before I
start crying.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are just awesome listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's that one guy over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be part of the group again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks again for
listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll be back in just a couple of
days with another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this episode had no grow lessons in
it, but you got a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get back onto that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also get to some emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of great stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Kelvin Medina in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Kelvin?
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
Thank you.
