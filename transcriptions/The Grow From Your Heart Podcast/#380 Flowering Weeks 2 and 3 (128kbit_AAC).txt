[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 380 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says 64.7% THC and a total of
76.4 total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of my favorite strains to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite strains to take
photos of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always one of my favorite strains to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor and I always love that
nice head buzz from the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm taking dabs of Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that will make for a great
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be another grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started by setting a goal for our
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a right place for our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected and purchased the appropriate
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the grow, we are past
week one of flower and we are entering
[SPEAKER_00]: week two of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will highlight weeks two and
three or days eight through 21 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you need a better
foundation and you haven't been listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to the show, I recommend you head back to
episode 351 and start on the grow lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: in episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along and you
feel like you're up to speed, let's jump
[SPEAKER_00]: right into a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus on
weeks two and three of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, also known as days eight through
21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's recap a little
bit of the previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we changed our timer
to 12 hours on and 12 hours off to
[SPEAKER_00]: initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now seven days into the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully at this point, you have not over
fertilized or ran into any pH issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully at this point, you have not
interrupted the dark cycle at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interrupting that dark cycle will disrupt
the flowering phase and throw your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: into shock and possibly cause
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the garden has remained pest and
pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if everything is on the right track,
let's move in to week two or day eight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of the flowering process,
we're not going to notice much change from
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice a little bit of stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants may have taken off and they're
starting to get a little bit taller on
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your plants may be showing
preflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your plants may start indicating
sex around this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress if they are not showing you
sex yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing you're going to see at
this point is stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are starting to grow taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what we're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first three weeks, we're going to
see a lot of stretching happening to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we will probably start seeing
preflower and bud set starting to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: around day 10 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will definitely have little dandelion
looking bud sets popping up around day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are about to start getting very
exciting in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the environment and
conditions in our grow room during weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: two and three of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of flowering, during the
day, I try to aim between 70 and 80
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit for my daytime
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also aim for 40 to 50% relative humidity
for my daytime temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about nighttime
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the nighttime, I like to have my
temperature between 60 and 70 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also aim for 40 to 50% humidity during
my nighttime cycle at this stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to remind you, try not to have
more than a 10 degree temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in your day and nighttime
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called your diurnal temperature
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep that less than 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much of a drastic swing from day to
night temperature will start causing your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get stagnant, they will slow
down, they will not be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this will encourage powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's aim to keep that temperature
within 10 degrees from the day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we should add into our flower
room that I have been overlooking on
[SPEAKER_00]: previous episodes is more fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we are entering the flowering stage,
we are going to develop big fat chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more airflow once we have those
buds in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have big fat chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds will act like a sponge if there
is too much moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to blow some air around the
room and keep that moisture moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a little bit of wind and
airflow is really good for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them active.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some wind and a little bit of
pressure makes the stalks more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them want to stand up on their
own a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I shoved you a little bit,
you would spread your feet for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a little bit of wind makes the
plants want to spread their feet for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So add a little bit of wind and airflow to
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a wind tunnel in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to dry out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want the air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of your leaves start looking dry
and leathery and kind of potato chip like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably getting beat up by that
fan too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were ruining the VPD around those
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that condition, just reduce the wind
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's never a bad idea to have some
airflow in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice your grow room is
consistently too humid, it may be time to
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in a dehumidifier or maybe a larger
dehumidifier or possibly add some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan to remove that humid air
from the room and replace it with fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do add an extraction fan,
keep in mind that as the air gets sucked
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the room, it is also going to try
to draw air into the room through every
[SPEAKER_00]: open opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you're going to get air
pulled into the room underneath the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us don't seal the bottom of the
door well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is a great place for
fresh air to come in as long as the air
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that air is coming from within your
house, it is probably safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that crack leads to outside,
I would cover that up and find a safer
[SPEAKER_00]: source for the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to bring in bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to bring in whatever is by that
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's powdery mildew, if it's just dirt
and dust, it's going to suck all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: right under the door into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you cut a hole for an
extraction fan, start thinking about where
[SPEAKER_00]: the air is going to come in when you start
blowing that air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut a hole in a wall and add an
extraction fan and blow that air out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, it may create a whistling noise
underneath the door from all the air
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing underneath that door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it creates a big whistling noise,
you may need to add a passive hole for air
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just depends on the size of the
extraction fan that you set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a little four inch extraction
fan, you'll definitely pull enough air
[SPEAKER_00]: under the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to make any passive holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go setting up an eight inch vortex
fan in there and you're just blowing air
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I recommend a carbon filter
on that extraction fan that's going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to filter that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also you may need to make about a four
inch hole to allow air to get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: room somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are sucking all of the air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to allow fresh air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting holes in walls and adding
extraction fans can lead to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this very carefully before you
go this route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're using CO2, you may want to
think about this option because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to fill the room with CO2 and
then you're just going to use that exhaust
[SPEAKER_00]: fan to suck the CO2 right out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of blowing your expensive gas
right out the window, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of opened up the conversation
for negative pressure versus positive
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure in a grow room environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like that is a lesson for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will write a note and we will talk about
that in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a little bit more on track with
this grow lesson and focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
nutrients we may need at this phase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this part of flowering,
we are mainly focusing on a smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from the vegetative stage to
the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in flowering, we are mainly
focusing on a smooth transition from the
[SPEAKER_00]: veg stage to the flowering stage of our
plant cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two is very similar to week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will mainly focus on our NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a low nitrogen, high phosphorus,
high potassium diet at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, abandon the veg bottle and
start using the bloom bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we need Cal Mag at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need potassium silicates,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to add a mycoproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of root product is always good
at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, enzymes and carbs are great for week
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we work toward week three, I like to
increase my carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are getting bud set at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having some sugars in there to feed
the microbes and then I like having the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbs and the sugars in there to give the
plants energy that will encourage rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the beginning of week three,
I will start increasing my carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding just a little bit and I will
slowly increase that through the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't need to add a bloom booster
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just focus on getting these
plants through the stretch phase and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud sites developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we work on the next lesson,
we will start adding bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are rapidly running out of time for
pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do a very thorough pest
scouting and see what we've got in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a myriad of problems
popping up at this point in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do an inspection and find out what
we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find any pests, now is one of your
last times to apply a sprayed pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to spray anything after day
14.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an obvious problem,
we may extend that just a few days with
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific products, but I really don't
like to spray anything past day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a quick scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's identify any problems we may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's spray before day 14 approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we're at day eight,
so we can get two or three solid pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: spray applications in if they are
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't identify any pests,
I may still suggest a preventative spray
[SPEAKER_00]: around day 14 just to make sure nothing
pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to get in there and
identify pests and work really hard at
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of them before we move deeper
into the flowering phase and we really
[SPEAKER_00]: limit ourselves on pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a good time to start ordering
your predator bugs if you're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals as your pesticide treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on using biologicals,
think about your spray applications and
[SPEAKER_00]: use a strategy that will not cause harm to
your beneficials when they do arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pesticides that you can apply to
your plants today and you can release
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects tomorrow and they will
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply the proper pesticide,
you will not kill your beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to do some research on the
pesticide and the beneficials and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: they get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pesticides are based on
pyrethrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are based on neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are beneficial fungus and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those beneficial fungus and bacteria may
not kill or disrupt your predator bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it will make the environment
uncomfortable for the spider mites because
[SPEAKER_00]: they intend to eat those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predators are going to eat the spider
mites, not the leaves, so they may be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive with certain pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your responsibility as the grower to
do the research on the pesticide you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to apply and also do research on the
predator bugs which you plan to use in
[SPEAKER_00]: your integrated pest management strategy
and find out if they can work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the newer pesticide and fungicide
products actually advertise safe for
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials or will not harm beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is saying that they recommend that
product in a garden that is also using
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects as a form of pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on top of pest management,
let's do some scouting, and if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, now is the time to work on
getting rid of that before we get deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while you're scouting for pests,
that is a great time to keep an eye out
[SPEAKER_00]: for male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing from seed, you've got
the opportunity to find males in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also got the opportunity to find
hermaphrodites in the garden, and you may
[SPEAKER_00]: also find some mutants in your flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants are going to start popping
up around day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually open up and start dropping
pollen right around day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a very small window of time
to discover these males and get them out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room before they cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be lazy when it comes to pulling
males out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small garden, if you've
got a large garden, you need to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: every single plant and pull every single
male out of that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to pay very close attention
for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're checking for males and
hermaphrodites on new plants, check in
[SPEAKER_00]: several spots on each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top, may not reveal hermaphrodite
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down lower where you're not getting a lot
of light penetration, those plants may
[SPEAKER_00]: show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get male flowers popping up in
your female buds lower on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I gave a pretty good
description of what a male plant looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like and what a female plant looks like on
a previous podcast, but I do encourage you
[SPEAKER_00]: to Google male and female cannabis plants
and see what they look like before the
[SPEAKER_00]: time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you 've got a boy in the
garden, you are sure and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence and you can remove that male
plant from your garden confidently and
[SPEAKER_00]: know you are not going to cause any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to find the boys before the
pollen sacks start opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what happens if you find
a boy and one of those sacks is starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do is spray it
with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray that pollen with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll shut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, spray the girls with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got clean water around,
just spray some water on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I said we don't want to spray plants
that are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather get them a little bit wet at
this point than I would rather get pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this is just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pesticide in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants would get hit with rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get hit with dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them with some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will deactivate the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also make the plants unable to
receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you can either cut down
that male plant or you can slide a trash
[SPEAKER_00]: bag right over it like a condom,
then cut it, then get it out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try not to spread that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've sprayed it with water,
but as you bump it around, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: More pollen is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best not to spread that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the trash bag over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either take the whole plant, including the
dirt, out of the grow or cut it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: base and just get that plant out of there
as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving a male plant in the grow room for
too long will result in a seeded crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are aiming for a seedless crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing a crop for a commercial
reason and you're trying to put it out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market, a couple of seeds will
ruin the value of your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eye out for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what males look like and get them out
of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep an eye out for hermaphrodites
and get them out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we are past weeks two and three,
you cannot get lazy if you're growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they look like females,
you've still got the opportunity for a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite to pop up all the way
through the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not show itself until week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not show itself until week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to see it if it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said earlier, if it pops up late in
flower, it may not be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is too late for the plants to receive
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't make any seeds that late into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, if they throw a male
flower past week seven or eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're usually sterile male flowers that
will not contain any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not much to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're getting hermaphrodites early
in flower, they must be removed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've got our environment
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to feed our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are scouting for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have applied our final pesticide
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have considered releasing predator
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to look for males and
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on the look for trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about a few things we can
do to improve the quality of our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: this early in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a trellis or a scrog
net, now is a good time to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: working those buds into the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still work those branches into the
net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stop doing it probably toward the
end of week three, but you've still got
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a branch that's popping up
too high, feel free to give it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: crack, bend it down under the net and work
it into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can keep working on a nice even canopy
all the way through the end of week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep popping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep twisting them and working them
into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked a lot about popping and
twisting in the beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to do this all the way through
weeks four and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pop every stem right at the
beginning of flower, give it about two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to heal up and go back and do it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it about two weeks to heal up and go
back and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab the base of the stalk,
grab it with your other hand and twist
[SPEAKER_00]: your top hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you twist, you'll hear a little
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that heals, it will create a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That knuckle will make a strong spot in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that toward the entire plant
is covered in knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really knurled and I feel like
that that plant is very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice thick stock that can hold
a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got nice thick stocks that can
move a lot of water, which can carry a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it is a very beneficial
thing to crack all of the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continue working your plants into the
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a trellis, continue
cracking and popping the sticks to make
[SPEAKER_00]: robust plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to do a bit of lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some crappy branches on the
bottom of the plant, feel free to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got branches that come off the
very bottom of the plant and reach up
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the top and those top branches,
the tops have potential to create good
[SPEAKER_00]: usable buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean up the bottom suckers off of
that long branch and keep that arm and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a bud at the end of the arm and take
off all that little crap at the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: it that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very common to see plants that are
three and four feet tall that are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely naked for the first 18 inches
of the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bunch of sticks coming out of
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any little branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any tiny bud sites for 18
inches to maybe even two feet off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, depending on the growers
environment and the growers style and what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of lights they are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to get in there and cut out
any shitty branches that aren't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be productive and feel free to clean up
all that stuff real down low on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not going to get any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When harvest time comes, we're going to
have to trim everything we cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut all that little fluffy crap off
the plant, you don't have to trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're saying, yeah, I could have used
that for concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trades or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it all off the bottom,
we can move that energy right up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant instead of growing that
crappy little fluff at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just basically moved that up to that
top cola to make all those top buds just
[SPEAKER_00]: that much heavier, that much fatter,
that much more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean up any crap on the bottom that
may be slowing your plants down and move
[SPEAKER_00]: that energy right up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I find advantageous is
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of debate in the cannabis
industry about how to defoliate,
[SPEAKER_00]: what level to defoliate and when to
defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do kind of a hard defoliation
right at the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a large leaf shadowing another
branch or shadowing another bud site,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will remove that leaf without question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll go through the grow and anything
with a purple petiole gets removed at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this in a commercial environment for
several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing all of those extra leaves removes
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are less places for pests to hide
and there are less places for pathogens to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remove the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it reduces humidity in the room
without as many leaves doing as much
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration and respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit less moisture in the
room, so it makes it easier to balance the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think a well timed, well executed
defoliation will increase the vigor of our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people will say you don't
want to pull off the leaves because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the sugars are stored and they're
going to use that for nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are feeding the shit out of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to use anything that is
stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are pouring expensive nutrients into
these plants on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the stuff stored in
those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to replace that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another argument to the defoliation is
that those leaves are used as solar panels
[SPEAKER_00]: and they need to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a point where sometimes a
leaf is blocking a bud site where if you
[SPEAKER_00]: remove that leaf, it would be more
beneficial to put the light closer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud than on that big old solar leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So selectively remove your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new at defoliating, go in and
just tear off a few leaves and see how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next time, take off a few more
and see how the plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa leaning strains won't react as well
as indica leaning strains will react to
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I'll recommend is leave
those two leaves at the top of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have one bud, your main top
sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the top of that, there are two
leaves sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look in the grow room,
you'll see the two leaves I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave those on every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two mains that are sticking out of
the top of the main bud, I like to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: those until late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite often, those will be the only
large leaves I leave on every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend a semi-heavy defoliation
here at the beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll do it again around week four
and we'll do it again around week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliating and cracking and twisting and
working into trellis work is kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to get good at this over
time, which will require confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made countless mistakes in my own
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made mistakes in commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made tiny mistakes and I have made
huge mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I became a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience includes mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the last crop you are going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a practice crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one will be your pro crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't act like these plants are the last
plants you're ever going to get to touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build some confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get in there and break some
shit and ruin some shit so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see what can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next grow will be really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to wreck some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to cause some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If every grow goes smoothly for you,
you're going to think growing is easy and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to learn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your ego is going to get in the way
and that's when you're really going to run
[SPEAKER_00]: into problems and then you will have no
idea how to solve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is, don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and play with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may kill one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may kill two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will learn what they can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are way more resilient than
you would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first grow, if this is
your second grow, you're probably touching
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants like they're delicate little
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see me in a commercial
environment, you're going to think I am an
[SPEAKER_00]: abusive ogre to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then at the end, you will see the
highest quality, most beautiful buds come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of these plants that I kind of beat up
through their whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really care for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have a passion for the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm going really fast and I
don't have time for bullshit and I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot of stuff done in a small amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I get a little rough and
sometimes it looks like I'm being
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive and I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, the plants show
me that they were satisfied with what I
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are used to being outside
growing on a hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are used to being stuck in
one place and can't walk away when shit
[SPEAKER_00]: gets weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been beat up by nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them probably got peed on by a
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are amazingly resilient
plants and they can take some abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's abuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's beat them up a little bit and see
what they can take because I think when we
[SPEAKER_00]: push them to their limits, that's when we
see their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to get in there and
break some shit you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be your last crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that seeds and clones are
very expensive and that this crop means a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can take one plant and dedicate
it to experiments, you can learn a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot from that one plant and still produce
a very viable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're new at defoliating,
if you're new at popping and twisting,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're new at cracking the stems,
maybe just pick one plant, defoliate the
[SPEAKER_00]: crap out of one plant and then don't do
the others and pay attention to what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something very important to note here,
take a lot of notes when you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what you did to plant A,
write down what you did to plant B and
[SPEAKER_00]: then take great notes of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to have documentation
to find out if the techniques and methods
[SPEAKER_00]: you are using work for your garden and
work for you and work for the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: strain which you are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before, but most of us
growers are also concerned consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means sometimes we may forget some
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write some shit down and you will not
forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when the end comes and plant B is
way better than plant A, you know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what you did to make plant B stand out
from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can improve upon that and have a
better garden each and every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to experiment with one or two
plants in the garden until you develop
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're experimenting,
make sure to take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing I want to talk about
before we start wrapping up the show is
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs and lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we approach the third week of flower,
it is time to remove our metal halide bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: and start using the high pressure sodium
bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an LED, it's time to
switch from the blue to the more red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum if that is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave my veg bulbs in for the
first couple of weeks of flower because I
[SPEAKER_00]: find it helps reduce the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first 21 days of flower,
our plants are going to take off and
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch extremely fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper nutrients will help reduce the
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right amount of phosphorus and
potassium will reduce the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I feel like keeping in the blue
light, the metal halide light for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two weeks of flower will really help
keep the plants short and squat and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are approaching the end of the
stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to swap out that blue bulb for
the yellow orange reddish bulb,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be the high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have not already changed out
your bulb or hit the switch on your LED to
[SPEAKER_00]: change into the flowering mode,
now is the time to swap out those bulbs or
[SPEAKER_00]: hit that switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't wait any later than day 21 to
change my flowering spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any later than that, we start hitting a
point of diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do reduce the stretch, but we also
reduce the bulking when it comes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we are caught up on weeks two
and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our nutrients covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our environment dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have applied our final pesticide
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have released our predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to do so, we're going to
continue popping the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue working the tall
plants into the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep defoliating as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have selected a plant to do
some experiments on and you are taking
[SPEAKER_00]: good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are well into the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need to continue keeping our eyes
open for males and hermaphrodites and
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants as well as pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we haven't made any nutrient
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we haven't had any pH issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we haven't had any light leaks,
we're developing bud set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like dandelions forming on the
tips of all of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we have removed all of the males
from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still keeping an eye out for males
and hermaphrodites and mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as long as we don't run into any
equipment failures or human errors,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are well on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on our way to a great harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
