[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back
and we're hanging out with the winner of
[SPEAKER_01]: the secret cup mountain regional We got
our buddy from the Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Spencer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good, but I was just told that
there's a Garden of Weeden song written by
[SPEAKER_01]: our boy sloppy and it is freakin sweet
Yeah, it's pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our boy sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna play your song at the end of the
show Thanks for permission in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer said I can I gave him permission
and it says Garden of Weeden in it so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all spins So thanks for joining me on the
show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun taking dabs We hang out a
lot and I like it So Spence is the winner
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mountain region secret cup Some
people might not be familiar with the
[SPEAKER_01]: secret cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a little bit to tell them
what that is the secret cup is a Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually a tour which they go to
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to two places in Cali if I'm
correct I don't know if it's ever been put
[SPEAKER_01]: that way as a tour because that would be a
hell of a marketing way to put some shirts
[SPEAKER_00]: out I mean, that's how I think of it and
there's a championship in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the tour That's a good way to
put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they're listening and they get a
marketing idea from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, California Seattle here
Maybe Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure Arizona Rhode Island and then
all the it's basically a competition of
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere from 30 to 40 hash makers all
enter a certain amount of product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of the people that enter are
considered judges Because we all receive a
[SPEAKER_00]: judge back go through them and kind of
give everything a score from smell You
[SPEAKER_00]: know strength smoothness harshness color
flavor, you know down the line So each
[SPEAKER_01]: contestant actually gets a point three of
every sample, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you get to taste what everybody
else has done Everybody else entered and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the judge, right and we're the
judges So it's kind of a good thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: it is you know, it's not being judged by
just you know random people or like You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, just it's not a most technically is
a blind judge because nobody gets to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what you know, yeah Entries are so it's
all just numbered in whatever numbers or
[SPEAKER_01]: what you vote for So when you got your
judges kit, how long did it take you to
[SPEAKER_00]: find yours your entry like two minutes two
minutes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just had a lot of taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know it well I just you could go
through the entries and kind of just smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and I make the hash so you kind of get
attached I guess you could say to like You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, which is yours and what what it's
not I had there was a couple that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah Maybe and then as soon as you
find it, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell my flowers Sorry guys,
I'm all choked up actually I went to the
[SPEAKER_01]: secret cup for two days and took an
amazing amount of dabs And then today I
[SPEAKER_01]: went hang out with some friends in Denver
and my lungs and throat are burnt out from
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbing You guys got a hydrate if you're
dabbing that's something that I'm learning
[SPEAKER_01]: more hydration Spence reaches through the
water as I say that we're all red-eyed and
[SPEAKER_01]: throat-dried So yeah, everybody got to I
had the honor of tasting a couple of my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends were judges and entrance
contenders I don't know what the hell they
[SPEAKER_01]: were called They were judges and they
entered and I got to taste parts of their
[SPEAKER_01]: sample packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some were amazing Some I don't think I
would take a second dab of a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean there's definitely Well,
there's was 38 Competitors in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 38.3 is you got to go through and you
know, it's kind of tough depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of what kind of like I'm A weed
snob, so I'm definitely gonna be an oil
[SPEAKER_00]: snob, you know I'm saying so it's just and
a lot of its personal preference whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not you like it this way or you like it
that way so it's kind of that's why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good that We're the judges because it's at
least honest opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to wait a little bit to get into
live resin But I was worried with you
[SPEAKER_01]: entering live resin people were gonna say
it's not stable because the popular shit
[SPEAKER_01]: the rage is shattered is Shatter and the
live resin is not shattery at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of it looks like it's like oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like Oil and then depending
where it's at, you know, it's I think
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody said 66 degrees is when it
actually gets It'll shatter if you're if
[SPEAKER_00]: your house is 66 degrees you like your
house cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have shattery live resin But it's
almost that in here tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting nice and cool Colorado
temperatures are changing like this oil is
[SPEAKER_00]: cool right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Hey, thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other day you gave me a little sample
of Earl and I didn't even realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been dabbing off of the entry I've
been dabbing the winner here Several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you So in a second, we'll talk about
what's in that the event we kind of talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about what it is The people that enter are
the judges.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all everybody gets to taste the entries
So that's what it's all about and Spence
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually chosen as the overall
champion There's a couple of the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to talk about there was two location
changes Is yeah, if not if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably count three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because the venues in Denver got
switched twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Big D
right now Big D was smart enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hired a professional event company He
hired hired the right event services group
[SPEAKER_01]: right event groups or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean the right group I was
in charge They booked and secured a
[SPEAKER_01]: location as they got there and started to
set up They were told that they were not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to do the event there Big D is
smart enough to where he just made another
[SPEAKER_01]: phone call and said hey everybody go to
location number two He had a second spot
[SPEAKER_01]: lined up unfortunately That got shut down
also So I think AJ Hashman made a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of phone calls and a couple of emails were
sent and the lazy lion Sorry about the
[SPEAKER_01]: cough again guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really sorry that sucks to do a
podcast with that I bet it sucks to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: The lazy lion and the speakeasy vape
lounge volunteered to let the secret cup
[SPEAKER_01]: come have their party there They already
had ship booked for that night They
[SPEAKER_01]: canceled it and they came and or they let
us come and have a huge party there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Big D AJ Hashman and
everybody involved with the speakeasy and
[SPEAKER_01]: the lazy lion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super cool A lot of the vendors
packed right on up and came with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the booths were full Most of the
artists came Saturday was a little a
[SPEAKER_01]: little kind of bare but Sunday it was
pretty crowded in there Yes, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got crowded just depending on what time
of the day it was Yeah, the speakeasy was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to get into the speakeasy The
lazy lion was actually the VIP lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have my VIP badge So I
couldn't go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the lazy line is it's they by far
have the headiest glass collection I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen ever nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it Joe Peters Queen Bee took a
huge like I saw the picture that Maddie
[SPEAKER_01]: posted of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Maddie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh That piece is like 80k Are you able to

bong with a goldfish swimming in it It's
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled not to smoke out of it's like,
please don't get out of this with a bong
[SPEAKER_01]: with a big base and it's a beta fish
Actually, I said goldfish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beta.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm surprised no one's thought of
that before All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the places and people that
made that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about your entry now Your entry
was live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tell the people what strain
it was or are you kind of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's already out.

[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but um, it was a real The Scott's OG
was just an awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely lanky a very very Not
super tall, but it was you know taller
[SPEAKER_00]: than I would usually like plants to be but
um super fuely and heavy indica Just you
[SPEAKER_00]: know awesome resin production And a pretty
decent yielder too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that was the one I mixed with the sins,
which is a kosher dominant which the sins
[SPEAKER_00]: OG is blue power and kosher kush So it was
a kosher kosher kush dominant on phenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had a way better kosher like burnt
rubber Is she smell which comes out in
[SPEAKER_00]: hash as an og smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a real uh, it's got a fuely funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this hash definitely has a fuely
funk to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I smoke a lot of sativas because like
you said, i'm a sativa breeder I smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the sativa or a lot of sativa in
this indica kind of dominance in here
[SPEAKER_01]: really Sits me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes my eyes droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not a really nice cross What's
got the a citrus citrusy spice to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's adding that there's like sort of a
spice to the end It's almost got a lemony
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus Um that comes from the scots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, um, you get a little bit of lemon Um
og like that og pine this and sometimes a
[SPEAKER_00]: pine can transfer over to like a citrusy
lemon um So it was a very it was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, you know, it was a phenol hunt out
of you know, iraq Ran a pack and I kept
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three or four of them and you
know There's three or four of them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room and I got to pick which ones I
wanted to make the entry with so it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really it's really cool being able to
actually go in and You know pick what
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors a lot of a lot of the people who
won, you know, we're like Thanks to this
[SPEAKER_00]: person for letting me get the product,
you know And it was cool for us because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to ask anybody for product It
all comes from us all in house is great,
[SPEAKER_01]: too And it's good to know i've seen your
guys's garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that it's a clean Safe
garden where my medicine comes from I get
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of my oil comes straight from you

[SPEAKER_01]: get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you guys are the first three
people I go to when I need medicine How do
[SPEAKER_01]: you uh when you're looking in the room
what makes you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: That strain and that strain right there or
that plant and that plant right there are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna make award-winning oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um honestly it's more of just you kind of
literally go plant to plant and just You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you can't you can't do it in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of takes You know a week or two,
you know as they're finishing to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell which flavors are gonna come
through I was I don't even think I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do I made another batch the green
ribbon batch But the green ribbon just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't carry it the same like when you
feel some plants, you know how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like Some plants like super sticky where
you touch them and then your fingers are
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck together and there's some you touch
And you get like the stringiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah resin and then there's some you touch
where it's like just wet where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even It's like slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kind of go and look for
different, you know, okay For me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot about flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to you know, your hash is always
flavorful I had a bunch of your shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: with me and the secret cup and everybody I
would dab out would go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's tasty Yeah, yeah, it was a lot
of golden goat that you made and some
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies that you made I've got some
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it on secret stash secret stash
Hey, shout out to vigor love shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: vigor lover He's a homie somehow he got to
me some solvent-less hash that tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty damn good right on bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work I'm gonna have to hit some of
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I can leave in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool Hashtag team mids Poor guy
cannot get away from that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk a lot about live resin on this
show I am NOT a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody tells me that I've always got
great hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They compliment it I gotta say I don't
make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot about making hash Because a
little kev bro is my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my buddy I know how to read the
internet tells you all about making dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to know I like to be educated,
but I don't make hash I've been trying my
[SPEAKER_01]: best to describe live resin to people A
lot of people have asked about it after
[SPEAKER_01]: you exhale that fucking monstrous dab I
owe a dollar for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe a dollar every time I say that for
it on the show But after you yeah Will you
[SPEAKER_01]: teach me and our listeners a little lesson
about what live resin is and kind of how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so everybody's heard of fresh frozen
bubble hash so basically where you harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant you essentially freeze it or
flash freeze it and Then for ice hash
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd you know wash it in your bags or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Now instead of you know as far as
opening blasting I know people who do it
[SPEAKER_00]: live resin, but I think it's Once the
closed closed loop game came out and we
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out you could Do that same process
in a closed loop at a bigger scale it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash for the better in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously Yeah, so basically it's
fresh frozen closed loop bho.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um All right, if done proper, I'm gonna
I'm gonna go a little slower on that one
[SPEAKER_01]: He's taking plants that are ready for
harvest chop them down Freeze them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: deep freeze and then put them in a closed
loop butane extraction system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we'll talk about More about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Kevin and I have talked about that
but there's open blasting and closed loop
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence uses a closed loop method and blast
the fresh frozen like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it need to be vacuum purged after
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well once it comes Through your
system you it's really you know It takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the butane out before you even get
to touch the product using that close
[SPEAKER_00]: using the closed So it pumps it out
because it takes all the liquid back out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so then you're left with just
your product Um As far as you know flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think it keeps a better turf
profile it honestly if you alright So this
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna be kind of hard to understand But
it tastes like it smells when it's growing
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can understand what you know When
you touch a plant and you smell your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers that crazy smell you get that it
doesn't ever smell like that once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: dried and cured but Once you when you're
stripping or making hash from a fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: product you get that fresh flavor It's
like if your bud was a fruit and you took
[SPEAKER_01]: a bite out of that fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this hash tastes like Yeah,
and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got The turpinoid and that's yeah the
turf profile in there and that's just not
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's new word now is turps turps
turps So I just feel like an asshole every
[SPEAKER_01]: time I say turps, but the turps in that is
turpy slurpy It's just like a big it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like a bite of candy every time you hit a
dab of it's amazing It literally is like
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be dessert like one somebody
needs to make some jilly bean live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's There's crazy like all right,
so blueberry sour diesel That sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, some tangy orangey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made cookies live It was we got across
some tangy and some grateful dog See the
[SPEAKER_01]: tangerine dog the look on your face
tangerine dog I've been writing down
[SPEAKER_01]: strain names guys if you have neat strain
names You can feel free to tweet those to
[SPEAKER_01]: me at I grow culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might use one of them Name I might send
you a pack of it when I make it if I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember and if I can find your tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah But yeah, so live res is
basically, you know Fresh frozen VHL just
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a more flavorful purging and
I think that's what I was asking Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah vacuum purge it after you know,
everything I do goes into an oven after
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you extract it from your system
because your system takes Pretty much a
[SPEAKER_00]: good majority of it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but you still got to go through your
vacuum process to You know keep cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: and removing certain gases and stuff like
that Do you know do you do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: special to your plants or flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know you're gonna make oil out of
them for live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um No, I have done like What was it 48
hours of dark before?
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I really think with as far as live
it's all about the product you put in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the better You know the flowers
that are going in the better the oil It's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no trim run in this room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll pass no trim run I honestly
like from my trim like my personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still open blast it and I'll make it
It's you know, I think it comes out better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the closed loop, but it's good for
patients people need it But we're snobs
[SPEAKER_01]: over here and I'll stick with this no
grunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the no grunt I can almost tell the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can almost tell even smoke and shatter I
can tell a difference in Nug and Earl Nug
[SPEAKER_01]: run and trim run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely And you can taste once
you start Smoking live you can taste the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between if it's in a closed
loop and if it's not in the closed loop I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel super spoiled now that I smoke so
much live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I just It's a good it's a good I
find myself hiding my live like just no
[SPEAKER_01]: I've risen over here and the rest of my We
can smoke this shatter all day the live
[SPEAKER_01]: resin I'll bark at you like a dog if you
get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right So a little bit more about the
secret cup stuff, dude, you're a freaking
[SPEAKER_01]: champion now, bro You are a secret cup
winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it sunk in yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh No, well what's funny is about this is
I went to What was it secret cup last year
[SPEAKER_00]: when they had it in Denver?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with a couple buddies of mine and
that was like right when I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: first getting into really making like oil
like more than just you know every now and
[SPEAKER_00]: then and I remember telling everybody I
was like dude, we're gonna enter this cup
[SPEAKER_00]: next year and we're gonna win it and then
you know a year later we fucking You could
[SPEAKER_00]: say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying not to say fuck That's
another dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually every time I say it I owe a
dollar to a charity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um And I said we were gonna win it and we
came out and you know brought I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: came real proper and then a lot of the
differences between I think us which I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't speak for everybody, you know saying
cuz I don't you know, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that competed but like we didn't
have to source our Product we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually go pick it and I think that made
a difference as far as difference flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to pick certain flavors and
knowing what you want and hash You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I would have hated to have to go
source You know I'm saying just find
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's good enough to actually
have a guy to come straight to me for his
[SPEAKER_01]: secret material and yeah He's always like
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need this crop this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you understand how it is It's just all
about quality for sure for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I grow weed first before I
make hash so, you know, it's It's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: different when you spend ten weeks with a
plant and then make hash instead of buying
[SPEAKER_00]: it off the shelf and making hash with it
It's just it's a lot more full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Which is important to us like as we
say it's grown by us processed by us Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: to live resin to a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's cool It's been a fun
experience hasn't really I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sinking because I wasn't You know,
honestly, I went in with Thinking I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have a top three finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I'm just competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate losing So it was cool being able to
go in I almost thought I lost once they
[SPEAKER_00]: did all the awards and then third second I
was like, oh no, we didn't win.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I wanted to ask you They
did they did like highest CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did best turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did crowd choice or something like
that What was it connoisseurs choice
[SPEAKER_01]: connoisseurs choice and then they do third
second And then big D said so first place
[SPEAKER_01]: and he said something to the equivalent of
you guys already know who it is And I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh then it's probably somebody
that's already gotten an award.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I assumed But then he said
garden and as soon as he said garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I peed a little bit He went
through and did second place And it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubble which the bubble was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it that you know, I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I didn't even know it was bubble that
won Yeah, the second place solvent list
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble Um, but I looked at Maddie and I
was like we might not win And then like he
[SPEAKER_00]: did the announcement whatever and it was
tight and I wish I would have I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking I was gonna win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like my speech was super like short and
To the point I guess you could say it was
[SPEAKER_01]: well, it was perfect You said something
about where you're from.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is illegal So it's great to be here
with all these people making hash and
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrating and winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Didn't know I was gonna win I think I
thought I was gonna win but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just came through, you know I think we
really just put in everything we had into
[SPEAKER_00]: the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it paid off for us Were there any other
samples that stood out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, there was a couple there was
Kind bills the you know, shout out to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: bill for you know coming up with the live
resin tech Is that who made that yeah kind
[SPEAKER_00]: bill who won third is actually the day who
came up with live resin nice You beat that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know his own when he was talking
in his speech He was like, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some guys out here doing,
you know, my same technique that are
[SPEAKER_00]: killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um And I'm gonna say he was regarding me
Um, but yeah his is his was on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sour D deep chunk and Gorilla glue
and I think it was just it was really good
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was just too complex it wasn't like
straight to the not straight to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: but just Like the glue and the sour almost
the same thing and then the deep chunk is
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a sour diesel deep chunk or
something like that It's just a purple
[SPEAKER_00]: each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think if he would have done The sour
D and the glue would have been a whole it
[SPEAKER_00]: would have came out a whole lot better in
my opinion I think the flavors would have
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled through just that sour with What
was it saying gorilla glue is gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically a Old-school sour or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gorilla glue was a ridiculous plant,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is some crazy shit I've got one
growing right now and you got to tie it
[SPEAKER_01]: down and it will break the tie downs It's
like no I literally had one that had I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it started with three tops and I
literally just as it would grow We're just
[SPEAKER_00]: super crop each top down and then now it
has like 18 tops I literally have a 10
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon gorilla glue that has 25 stakes in
it I'm gonna have to Take a plant out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the room or something because these two
gorilla glues are taking more space than I
[SPEAKER_01]: completely predicted Yeah, I read who made
it the other day on the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm Yeah, and I read the cross too,
and I'm not surprised that it's so killer
[SPEAKER_00]: now that I read it So, what is it Kim sis
sour dub and chocolate tie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what made me think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the chocolate I'm
taking a dab.
