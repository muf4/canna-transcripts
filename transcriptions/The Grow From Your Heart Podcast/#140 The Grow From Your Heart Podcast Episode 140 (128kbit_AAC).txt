[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time for episode number 140 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_07]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_07]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_07]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_07]: for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends call me Ross DeGioffo and I
thank you guys again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_07]: As always, I need to give a huge shout out
to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_07]: letting me use their music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thanks to Kat and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, right across the table from me,
mimicking the intro, miming it at me is my
[SPEAKER_07]: friend, Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the show, hon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, hi, hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had it word for word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I told you one day I'm going to do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to try it right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to start over?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hit rewind.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you, you're never going to see it
coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to push me to like,
it's like a ninja dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to push me to the side
and take over.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you remember what happened to Clint
when he did that?
[SPEAKER_07]: That other voice you hear giggling over
there, that handsome voice, that studly
[SPEAKER_07]: voice, that's our buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay, we apologize for not having you
last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a boys club.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_07]: She brought a bunch of live resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to give her a shout out and I
got a little choked up about it,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe because she made me take a gigantic,
ridiculous glob of some live resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But holy crap, what are you trying to do
to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a little bit of a head cold or a
sinus infection or some stupid shit
[SPEAKER_07]: slowing me down for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fighting it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Been trying to take small dabs over here
for a change and take good care of myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been taking a vitamin supplement and
drinking double the water and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This girl shows up and globs me the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw her handed over and thought,
oh, that's going to be one of those shows
[SPEAKER_06]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen you in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be honest, I didn't know you were
taking baby dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for... No, you made me man up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said you didn't have to take it all.
You made me step up to the plate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have split it with you or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I stepped up to the plate and I needed it
and I feel better for having done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like a true cannabis, I don't know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm dedicated as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a turp kid turped out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming over tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this podcast might've been doing
this tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might've been Mike's idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike might've accidentally scheduled this
for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes a plan just comes together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it when it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a couple of nights ago I was chilling
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really quickly, shout out to my
friends at Elevate Glass 517 South Tejon
[SPEAKER_07]: in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, if you need smoking accessories
of any sort, everybody in this room has
[SPEAKER_07]: been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Mike's been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I take you with me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I've been to Elevate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just lied to our listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for misleading you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike will be at Elevate very soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Lindsay's been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very affordable, high quality glass and
super lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a reason that the listeners don't
know about my awesome rig and it's because
[SPEAKER_06]: it don't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then we got to take you to Elevate
one day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I throw all my rig money at my kid right
now, but I've got a little stash going and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's only a matter of time before I'm up
there getting something nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got something affordable for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: The banger is only 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: They might make something happen for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Affordable rigs are awesome rigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to everybody over there.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big hugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fist bumps all around.
[SPEAKER_07]: 517 South Tejon, support that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a new rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a recycler.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a case for your rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get some stickers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get some heady jewelry.
[SPEAKER_07]: All kinds of good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the point of the show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know where this idea came
from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent Mike a text message.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, hey, dude, let's do a podcast
about dispensary etiquette.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike is a budtender at a recreational
dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody 21 and over is allowed to shop in
that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got an ID, a passport,
what else works?
[SPEAKER_06]: A valid USI issued ID.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That says you're 21 and over?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you're able to go in there and buy an
ounce of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: An ounce for anyone now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay works in a medical cannabis
facility in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado Springs does not support any
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: They only have medical, so you can only
shop medically.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have your purple card.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it sounds so weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be a red card, but now you have
to have your purple card.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've both got very similar experiences,
yet very different experiences as
[SPEAKER_07]: budtenders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay is the dreadlocked budtender at
Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're there, give her a shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Say, what's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let her know that you heard about her on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give her a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she's super busy, just say,
hey, I listened to you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let her move on because she's got shit to
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she's not busy, make sure you say hi to
her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Support your budtenders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike is a budtender in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you see him tending bud for you,
give him a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell him I heard about you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, say hi, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike was my budtender at the spot on my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: My one and only time I've ever gone into
the spot and bought something,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike was my budtender.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that could be you people.
See?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was he nice to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually gave me a free t-shirt for my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say birthday shirt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was he informative?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you go back based on your experience
with Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trolling you a little bit to see how
far you're going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know a performance review was
going to be put on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You come in all the time, so I was like,
oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but you're wonderful to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't come in and annoy you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not like, can I smell this jar?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I smell this jar?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I smell this jar?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't have any money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to smell jars.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that the first one on the list?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because that's a great way to start.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do some introduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk, I don't think I even
talked about what the, did your headphones
[SPEAKER_07]: get out?
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you pointing at your ear.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just keep tapping until they come
back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any better?
[SPEAKER_07]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: No minor cut now.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it work?
[SPEAKER_07]: You had it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right about here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then this one is Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this working?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just go touch it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: This piece of gear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fading in and out right to left now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what you did to me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was perfect till that happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Bump, bump, bump.
[SPEAKER_07]: We good?
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Headphone check.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope your headphones are working as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We might be able to edit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then probably not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: That little box is evil.
[SPEAKER_07]: This will go live to drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to do a podcast that is
about dispensary etiquette.
[SPEAKER_07]: How a dispensary shopper should conduct
themselves properly to not make themselves
[SPEAKER_07]: look like an asshole and not to annoy the
fuck out of the dispensary workers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both my friends work in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a lot of dispensary work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was the fucking person.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did basically everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got plenty of budtending experience
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew the weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I budtended for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I opened and closed the shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did the bank deposits.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got a lot of dispensary
experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started doing this back when we're like
budtending was being invented.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what that looked like we sort of
created.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no marijuana enforcement
division tracking system.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no regulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no proper zoning.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was none of that shit which is why
we don't have a shop now because we kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of made all the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: They decided let's make rules that pushes
them out is what made all the rules for
[SPEAKER_07]: our community here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how the rules were made.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a piece of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever fucks them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the new rule.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how they worked on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to talk a little bit how to
conduct yourself like a proper gentleman
[SPEAKER_07]: or gentlewoman in a dispensary since all
my friends work here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tips are going to be a little bit like
everybody and then kind of pro level
[SPEAKER_06]: because we have a rec shop and a medical
shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: The expectations are going to be a little
bit different in those two different
[SPEAKER_06]: marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because one's medical one's one's
rec.
[SPEAKER_06]: One one customer type is just anybody
walking in off the street or that drove
[SPEAKER_06]: here from a neighboring state to check it
out for the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other has like joined a state
program and should know considerably more
[SPEAKER_06]: about the product and the selection and
whatnot when they walk in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how you said should know.
Should.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also the first couple of times may
require much more guidance.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first couple of times.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things I really wanted to
stress for the show is questions are
[SPEAKER_06]: totally appropriate.
[SPEAKER_06]: They might not be appropriate in that
moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a guy recently that asked me is this
a good time to ask a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed you guys are usually busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's slow now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said sure dude it's dead right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have fire away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turns out this guy had been
shopping with us for like six or seven
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he was enough that I knew his face
and kind of knew what his order was going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he really had no clue what he was
doing was total marijuana novice and
[SPEAKER_06]: needed everything kind of broken down for
him.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the lingo all the different products.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd just been coming in buying a joint
taking it home unrolling it and smoking a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit of it in the tiny cheap ass
glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sold him his first time in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then I've kind of had him up and
showed him the ropes and got him going.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like he just waited for the right time
to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: People should be free to ask those
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come in and do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's a long ass line and it's
100 degrees outside and everybody in the
[SPEAKER_06]: lobby is impatient don't smile at me big
and go it's my first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me about everything in depth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then listen to the answers to the
questions because if you ask me for a
[SPEAKER_06]: third time in under five minutes it's
going to be hard not to be I don't know
[SPEAKER_06]: disappointed in you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry did I just go off on a little rant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys were dishing out the dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is partially on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be aware is what I took from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be aware of if there's a time and
place for everything is this the time and
[SPEAKER_07]: place to ask a million questions or are
there 100 people in line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes we would love to treat every patient
every customer every.
[SPEAKER_07]: So since it's not this is an odd question
since it's not medical what do you call
[SPEAKER_07]: the people at customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just custies now.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we try we would try to treat every
customer every patient as as their it's
[SPEAKER_07]: their first time and they're golden.
[SPEAKER_07]: But sometimes we have a line to move and
there are people that are just getting
[SPEAKER_07]: pissed and the dispensaries have to stop
taking orders at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they don't have everybody out of
there they'll get fined and the last
[SPEAKER_07]: shoppers in the place can't get rung up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes it is a rush to get through
the crowd because not so much at the
[SPEAKER_07]: medical dispensaries but the recreational
dispensary that Mike represents they are
[SPEAKER_07]: busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes there is a line and they got to
rush through to get everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know we're kind of small so
sometimes like when we get I mean you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't have more than one person to one but
like one group of if you're all together
[SPEAKER_04]: like there's two or three of you to one
bud tender.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I can't have a lot of people in
the bud tending room while it's just me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If like someone comes in with their friend
I can take both of them back and be back
[SPEAKER_04]: there by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if anyone else comes back as a patient
then another bud tender or someone another
[SPEAKER_04]: employee needs to come out on the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it does actually it can get kind of
busy over green and healthy just depending
[SPEAKER_04]: on like what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's because we're super tiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the whole place is super tiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's usually two bud tenders there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Joe will he three in there today
and I was like well thank God because it
[SPEAKER_04]: got kind of like crazy at one point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to her for covering shifts for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you I don't think you
listen to the show bro but either way
[SPEAKER_07]: hunts getting a shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's covering shifts at the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the store and it's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good work brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate having a boss that's willing
to grab the fucking broom and sweep up
[SPEAKER_07]: when we need that shit done.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not above any job which is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah be aware if it's not the right
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go asking a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sneak a couple of questions in there as
shit's happening while the bud tender is
[SPEAKER_07]: weighing stuff throw out some questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one golden question that you really
need answered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to throw that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there might be a manager that can help
you if you really have some questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's quite often a manager that needs
something to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's his job is to field that type
of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So find a manager and the bud tender may
be happy to point you to one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That may be your new strategy bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terry can answer that or whoever the fuck
is there standing right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's nobody there named Terry.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're very different as shop layouts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I might have 20 people in my 20
customers in my bud room at one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being helped by five or six different bud
setters.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this moving around it can get like
kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they play loud music in your bud room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah there's music going and people going
and people coming in and out shopping IDs
[SPEAKER_06]: getting checked people waiting in line.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other times it's super slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just varies.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we made a little some just a very short
list of things to talk about here because
[SPEAKER_07]: we wanted to have something to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys like it when you ramble
but we want some structure to this
[SPEAKER_07]: madness.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing that you should think
about when you're in the dispensary a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of you people that are listening this may
not apply but a lot of people need to
[SPEAKER_07]: think about this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch your mouth in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying you can't say the F word
you can't you can't use profanity but if
[SPEAKER_07]: you have any intentions of the product
that you are buying leaving your hands
[SPEAKER_07]: just keep your mouth shut about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't hint about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't joke about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to flip that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not for anybody else and you are not
going to ship that product.
[SPEAKER_07]: If any of those things are going to happen
if you're even allowed the sale the moment
[SPEAKER_07]: you walk out of the door the bud tender
and the manager have a little meeting
[SPEAKER_07]: together and they're like hey fuck this
guy and they put you on the band list and
[SPEAKER_07]: we have it in the computer to where when
we run your name that you're checking in
[SPEAKER_07]: it pops up and says do not sell to this
customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say do that but I mean
fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's your thing do your thing player.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pimp it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to know about your black
market hustle.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone legit for a reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to cut you off if you tell us that
we don't want to have to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do your thing and just keep your mouth
shut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legally we are not allowed to sell you
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you say to us that you are going to
take that weed and redistribute it in any
[SPEAKER_04]: form.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point we have to refuse the sale
and say sorry we can't sell you anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to leave now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it it's so serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't you can't walk into a blood room
and say oh this this two ounces of wax
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'm picking up are all going to go to
Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't say like I'm so like thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun thinking you were going to
buy that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to joke that I wanted to make a hat
that says stop asking me how to take this
[SPEAKER_06]: to Texas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it's I mean sometimes it's innocent
like you look at they'll look up and go
[SPEAKER_06]: like do you think the drug dogs going to
smell the weed candy bar in the cooler.
[SPEAKER_06]: My response is always just a flat level
look right in the eye and go yeah like
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not magic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to make matters worse it's been in a
weed store full of other weed getting
[SPEAKER_06]: touched by people that touch weed over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just because the chocolate happens to
be in a child proof container doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_06]: it's special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we know that people are going to do
this from time to time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't stop you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you articulate that in the blood
room we have to refuse the sale and kick
[SPEAKER_06]: you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fun for anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to kick people out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to get kicked out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just knock it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So watch your mouth when you're there you
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry we went off on a tangent but they
like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since Lindsey's here here is something
that we thought we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're in the dispensary oftentimes
there are beautiful young ladies working
[SPEAKER_07]: at the counter.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will greet you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will take your ID.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll check your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't fucking flirt with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not there for you to flirt with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep your dick in your pants at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chill out on that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got a job to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to fucking hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been there all day working.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not there for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just shut up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it to yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Save it for later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just leave Lindsey alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave all the other hotties that work in
the dispensary alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it once or twice when I was
there shopping.
[SPEAKER_07]: That just happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's constant and it's disturbingly
frequent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsey's one of my best friends and I
love it when we hang out at events.
[SPEAKER_07]: People always think we're together because
she's got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We look like we could hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we said we dated people would be like
yeah I saw that coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: We became too good of friends and skipped
that phase.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I love it when we hang out at events
because people think we're together and
[SPEAKER_07]: guys don't bother her and girls don't even
come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of times other dudes won't even
come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they think I'm talking to a girl
and they're like oh just leave him alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just get to hang out and enjoy some
time and some music and wherever we went
[SPEAKER_07]: for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait for next secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when it's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when it's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The date got released on Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they really release that?
[SPEAKER_04]: The 23rd.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm in Vegas that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: God stop telling people that in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said that... God damn it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sitting here looking at it like I
could go for one more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a dab bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not gonna stop you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think you could go for one more we
need you to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need you where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have a show to host.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just ramble in the middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like she just handed you the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take as big a dab as you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that lemon G?
[SPEAKER_04]: No that is the cactus cooler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like lemon G when I hit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be jealous.
[SPEAKER_07]: This stuff's delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally ended up with a cut of that
cactus cooler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gonna be fun to play with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cactus cooler.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes if you've ever had a cactus
cooler soda it tastes just like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it sounds like bullshit but it
does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it crazy that it smells and tastes like
Froot Loops to me and it's like flower
[SPEAKER_04]: form?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like opened up the jar of it the other
day at the shop and I was like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike get up on Mike a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let him hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright that's enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh what's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude is dying from a dab over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Living bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't give him the dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't kill him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He took it himself.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next bullet point we've got written
down is when you're at the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_07]: you're buying either the medical or the
recreational dispensary don't tell me how
[SPEAKER_07]: high you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at work fucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been here for probably four or six
hours and haven't had a chance to go blaze
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're telling me I'm so high right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave me the fuck alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is like you guys usually
say that after you've done something
[SPEAKER_04]: either really wrong or said something
really wrong or said something really
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal or like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or minimal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah like oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just drove here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right like and I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean like I just don't know if you're
trying to look cool while you're saying it
[SPEAKER_04]: but like I'm not trying to be mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really doesn't make you look cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes me think that you're an
airhead stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah that I'm so high right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a little old especially when
we're at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wish we were stoned too but we're at
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's a real job.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that a lot of people
don't get.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that works at the liquor store
isn't drunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like why does everyone assume we're baked
out of our mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't smoke on the premises.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the premises.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't smoke within like a thousand
feet away from that place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you smoke cigarettes on the.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: No at the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the dispensary premises.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like isn't there like a you have to be a
certain feet away from.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually anything that can be construed as
marijuana consumption can get a shop in a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there are plenty of shops that
don't even let people consume tobacco on
[SPEAKER_06]: the property.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it when people roll into the
dispensary and they're smoking a cigarette
[SPEAKER_04]: because now I have to really sit there and
look and see what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Realistically because I mean you guys just
come in and say the weirdest stuff and
[SPEAKER_04]: most illegal stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to assume you're coming in and
doing it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just chill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chill the fuck out you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's you got to remember what we're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like yes it's a weed store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes the people in it are also huge
cannabis fans.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really like it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love getting dabbed to the point where
we're fucking this high.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't roll into this supermarket
and when we go to pay for our shit like yo
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so high right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us do but like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah but it's the same people doing it at
the dispensary.
Knock it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's annoying there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I like the whoever made the liquor
store in LNG.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was you Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't walk into the liquor store
drinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you like you know it's just
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to respect there's a business
license at stake at these places.
[SPEAKER_07]: The license is ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ridiculously expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And shops can lose them for very minor.
[SPEAKER_06]: For things that you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seemingly obnoxious things.
[SPEAKER_06]: If customers for example check out take
their product and then walk into the
[SPEAKER_06]: bathroom with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can get fined.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our security guard is forever on
the lookout for anyone headed towards the
[SPEAKER_06]: bathroom just so we can make sure they
don't happen to have a bag with a sealed
[SPEAKER_06]: product bag with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it could look like on site
consumption and just that somebody walking
[SPEAKER_06]: in there setting the bag of stuff they
just bought on the paper towel dispenser
[SPEAKER_06]: going to the bathroom washing their hands
and leaving could cost us our license.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I don't really want to out the
shops like annual gross or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like we do a good bit of business and
that business employs a good number of
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of that's over because some dude
took a shit next to a bag of marijuana he
[SPEAKER_06]: legally purchased.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all your permits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even a place to have it a place
you have a grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many more things to think
about that is just permanent like excuse
[SPEAKER_04]: me permits and being licensed.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a massive industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't it all do what we do under the
level of scrutiny that we operate under.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were all baked all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that brings me to one of the next
bullet points that we wrote down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't blame the rules on the bud tenders a
lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen people get mad.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've showed up to the spot dispensary
where Mike works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try not to say their name too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Lindsey called him out for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am no longer affiliated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't say their name too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: No hatred or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let that be known.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have a security guard right as you
walk in security guard right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like I.D.
[SPEAKER_07]: please.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people like who the fuck are
you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, who the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're coming into our place.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's kind of the vibe right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't walk into here and question
authority like that security guard is
[SPEAKER_07]: there to keep that place compliant,
because if you're not old enough,
[SPEAKER_06]: you've got to get there and talk shit
about him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's not people do the weirdest shit
at the weed store.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weirdest stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But those security guards are only doing
their job.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rules are and we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people that are that people that hate
the security guard, that dude is just
[SPEAKER_07]: doing his job, making sure that people
that aren't under 21 don't get in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if people are under 21,
get in there and buy weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Place closes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't get mad at Mike or Lindsey when
they won't sell you product illegally.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a business license at stake here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of my listeners, we don't have to
tell them this, but maybe they'll they'll
[SPEAKER_07]: share this.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are cameras everywhere from it to
grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't go anywhere and not be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can barely close the bathroom door and
then I'm not on camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as I'm in there with the bathroom
door closed, I'm not on camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I walk out back on camera time
to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smile.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on candid camera from every
freaking angle and the cameras are so good
[SPEAKER_07]: that if we lose a key, you can circle the
key on the screen with your finger.
[SPEAKER_07]: You circle the key and then you can track
the key in the video.
[SPEAKER_07]: The video will just follow the key from
camera to camera and show you where it
[SPEAKER_07]: goes until you can find your keys that you
lost earlier today.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how good those cameras are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so anybody that thinks that they're
like, well, just do this for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no just do this for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time something happens, it's on
camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's documented in a computer.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no pulling no fast one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's no getting away with that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nobody would risk their hundred
thousand dollar facility for just to sell
[SPEAKER_07]: you an extra illegal gram or three or an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other that thirty to four hundred
dollars they would make is not worth their
[SPEAKER_07]: business license because they have five
other customers in line that are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: spend that already.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't need to risk it on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't don't ask people to break the
rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be mad at Mike and Lindsey and
myself even that there are rules that have
[SPEAKER_07]: to be enforced.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just how that shit is.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get to play.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us play.
[SPEAKER_07]: We paid to play.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know, the stuff people
complain about and the rules they break
[SPEAKER_06]: are so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_06]: The security guards there for your safety,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we just had a shop in Aurora get
robbed or where the security guard was
[SPEAKER_06]: shot three times and killed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say that in the one in
the springs that got held up yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see that one yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: As as a whole, like the the statistics on
it don't dispensaries get robbed a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: less frequently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they should statistically because
most people know we have intense security
[SPEAKER_06]: setups on every shop that's required.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have a security system good
enough to bust anybody doing something
[SPEAKER_06]: stupid on the property, you don't get a
license.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get to be a marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just how it is in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not as frequent as it could be,
especially given the cash nature only most
[SPEAKER_06]: of the business.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still an issue like the armed
security guards there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rules that we operate under are there
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: That reason might be and often is making
some whiny son of a bitch up in Denver
[SPEAKER_06]: that's operating from a place of fear and
paranoia and has no idea what they're
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they created some dumbass rule we have
to follow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're all willing to follow right now
just to set a good example for
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under no circumstances are we going to
sell you over the limit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under no circumstances are we going to
tell you where you can buy pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of us don't even know anymore because
why would we bother?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stress enough how regulated the
cannabis industry is.
[SPEAKER_07]: From seed to sale is what they call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for all of you who don't live in
Colorado and think that it is just some...
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you come here, you guys think
it's just some open system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are so regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys are right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't just slip you an extra.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't just ring you up for an extra
if... Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they look at the books and see that I
sold you over what your limit is,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole shop can get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get shut down.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can just come in and say,
OK, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut down until further notice,
until we've gone through your books and
[SPEAKER_04]: seen what we... We've gone through
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No jobs, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No reason to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no store.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's just... I'd be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: My trimmer would be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's how many people at Green and
Healthy at the store?
[SPEAKER_07]: Four?
[SPEAKER_04]: There is four of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: All four of you would be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not just the one location that
it gets screwed up at.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's every license tied to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happened a couple of times in
Colorado where a marijuana business with
[SPEAKER_06]: five or six different licenses,
they had a couple of dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_06]: one or two grows and maybe a product
manufacturing license somewhere doing
[SPEAKER_06]: hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: One specific license, one specific
location had a couple of violations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two weeks later, all seven licenses
suspended indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven months later, when they finally get
a hearing, their licenses are revoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole business is closed,
millions of dollars gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dozens of people out of work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just wandered off the street from
Texas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would I sell you over the limit?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it just doesn't make any sense why
you're asking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's confusing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marisol will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will not.
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably won't.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's where I get to a segue.
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of just set me up into a good
segue for something that... This is a line
[SPEAKER_07]: that Mike and I used to get to say to
people at our dispensary that we had that
[SPEAKER_07]: we...
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where I first employed Mike as...
We didn't put this one on the list of
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't go over this, but I already know
what he's going to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the greatest thing to say to
people is there are no returns at a
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you buy a product, we legally cannot
take it back from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you leave the store with that product,
it is now yours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please look at the product that you're
going to buy before you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll show it to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll fucking take it out of the package.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't touch it until you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a rule in the store.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't put your hands on it,
but you can get real close and look at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tell what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could smell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't do no bait and switch.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's none of that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want this gram, that you see,
Lindsay will put the lid on that gram and
[SPEAKER_07]: you can't carry it to the counter.
[SPEAKER_07]: A badged employee actually has to carry
that product to the cash register and ring
[SPEAKER_07]: it up until it's packaged and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't give it to you, but you'll get
that gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no returns.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you like that shit before you
leave and then don't go home and complain
[SPEAKER_07]: on Facebook that you bought some shit that
you didn't want.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_07]: No returns at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: That leads me into this next part.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no discounts at the dispensary
either.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know Hunt, good for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know Rasta Jeff, I'm sorry,
we can't give you a discount because Rasta
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff does not make the prices here at the
store.
[SPEAKER_07]: The store prices are set by the owner of
the store and they're held by the
[SPEAKER_07]: management.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the old line that everybody used to
love to tell Mike and I when we had the
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary downtown, but the dispensary in
the county will give me ounces for way
[SPEAKER_07]: cheaper than you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheaper over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the deal?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, if that's really the
price, why did you come here?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we would always tell them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go over there and get an ounce and
get me one while you're there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you money if it's that cheap.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just look at you like fuck because
they were lying every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one I get all the time now is,
well, my cousin has ounces for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, well, if that's true,
you're here for one of two reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: A, he got sick of you for some reason and
stopped answering your phone calls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or B, you got sick of having one weed
auction and you came to a store that has
[SPEAKER_06]: 50.
[SPEAKER_06]: You came here for a reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: That reason wasn't we had ounces for the
same price as your fucking cousin.
[SPEAKER_06]: As your cousin's weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for incriminating your cousin,
BTdubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sloppy calls that try snitching.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my man Sloppy up on the
mound.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you listen to the podcast still,
brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing but love.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations on the little one,
Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've made it public.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love on the little Sloppy Savannah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited for Papa Slop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys not hear how tired I am?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm just saying, we've been saying
congratulations to a lot of people lately
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm starting to think people don't
understand how exhausted I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slop's a young kid and wants to fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, he done made him a baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got pills for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You like to fuck as much as Sloppy does.
[SPEAKER_07]: You make some babies.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I have birth control.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what I just wanted into.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, what's next on your list?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's next on my list?
[SPEAKER_07]: No discounts, B.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can get it, if you're going to tell
me that it's cheaper over at that store,
[SPEAKER_07]: go to that fucking store and get it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell me how cheap it is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're cool and deserve it,
if you don't ask for some discounts and
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a discount available, the
Budtender will be kind enough to go,
[SPEAKER_07]: hey, you want a dickhead, today is fucking
titties Tuesday and you get the titties
[SPEAKER_07]: discount or whatever it happens to be and
you'll get some deals.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to beg for anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: They slash we will give all of the
customers the appropriate discounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I should add that there's no
minimum purchase.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like because you made it into the Budroom
doesn't mean you have to buy something and
[SPEAKER_06]: act like I'm robbing you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: You pay for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just say no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn around and leave.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It stores all the time that even we
related.
[SPEAKER_06]: I walk in, I realize that I don't need to
spend eighty five dollars on a t-shirt and
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not rude when I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the customer or the employees there
aren't offended when I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But every now and then I'll have somebody
that comes in is shocked by the price of
[SPEAKER_06]: legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask them what they want.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like, well, go ahead and give me a
gram of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I ring them up, they act like
I've grabbed them by the balls and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: squeezing money out of their pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so bizarre if you do have an
experience at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could say, um, when you have if you have
a shitty experience at a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it's recreational or retail,
the first plan of attack is not to go to
[SPEAKER_07]: weed maps and Facebook and bash the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should go back, either call or go back
and see if the problem can't be resolved
[SPEAKER_07]: in an adult manner before you go try to
get crazy on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's a keyboard commando and they're
all fired up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just call the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all adults.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want you to be happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got we want you to come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a reputation to uphold.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a relationship with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want you coming back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to just take your money and
forget about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're not happy with it,
don't don't go bash the Internet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just try to contact the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to go back if you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that a lot of you have
traveled away if it's a recreational
[SPEAKER_07]: facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's a medical place, just come
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't take your refund.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't take your shit back.
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe we can figure out something to
make you happier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can adjust things, but don't go
to the Internet and be a dick right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will run a business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most places run a business.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're still around at this point in
Colorado, they're probably doing a
[SPEAKER_07]: business.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that that pretty much I think
that wraps up most of my unless you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: got something you want to add to the weed
etiquette part.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got another topic I kind of want
to talk about for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't take too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: A recent article up in Denver,
some news anchor went online online to
[SPEAKER_06]: plead with people to wear pants to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, he walks by one every day on
his way to work or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's always people walking in
wearing boxers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume he means female people.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've had a couple of people show up
and get the last one was also drunk,
[SPEAKER_06]: but walk up barefoot like inch topless to
the door like just a dude wearing some
[SPEAKER_06]: shorts, no shoes, no shirt, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, no, you're not getting in,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they get offended when they can't
get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, is there any store in America
where you can just roll up barefoot and
[SPEAKER_06]: topless and shop at that's not like an
open air market at a beach?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're we're choosing a shirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Surprisingly, there's a weird lack of
common sense sometimes when it's the weed
[SPEAKER_06]: store.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's people getting
overexcited or people assuming that
[SPEAKER_06]: because we're the only place on the planet
that really has weed store like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: They accidentally they blend drug dealer
habit and trap house habit into the store
[SPEAKER_07]: experience because they just in their
mind, in your mind, going to buy weed was
[SPEAKER_07]: going to some white dude with dreadlocks
his house and sitting on his couch and
[SPEAKER_07]: playing dreadlock playing fucking video
games for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put the white guy dreadlocks in there
because it used to be me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking showing up at my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to come to my house and I'd
make you fucking play seven or eight
[SPEAKER_07]: rounds of black ops just so that it didn't
look like we were doing business.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to come and listen to whatever
you see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought and hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's and so you used to get into that
mode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go hang out with Jeff for 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's two episodes of how it's made
and then head home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're thinking that that's going to
happen and that you're their drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as soon as they come into the
dispenser, you've now become me for these
[SPEAKER_07]: guys in their mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're their surrogate weed dealer.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, dude, a lot of people I bought
weed from before, like if you showed up
[SPEAKER_06]: half drunk, barefoot and topless at their
house, stumbling across from the street,
[SPEAKER_06]: they screamed at you for 20 minutes before
not selling you weed and sending you home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Depends on who you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you show up barefoot and topless here,
there might be prizes.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like three hundred and forty
pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just gave me the greatest look.
[SPEAKER_06]: The look on Lindsey's face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: This podcast has got so many strange
places.
[SPEAKER_07]: She just looked and I wasn't sure she was
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was like, you motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't sure if I got props or if she was
questioning my judgment or what was
[SPEAKER_07]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was like, don't encourage them,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I thought I read on her face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barefoot naked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have prizes for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This dude was a prize of this dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not in.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a beard, this does not apply
to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sloppy drunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a couple of little bits since we
released the last episode and nobody has
[SPEAKER_07]: replied with the Wal-Mart challenge yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might allow some people by that point
in the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people listen all the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I mean, I hinted that I wanted to
talk about more stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Recently, I've seen people discussing this
and I wanted to just state my my piece on
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Facebook, there's a thing going around
about illegal cultivators not wanting
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis to be legalized because it's
putting them out of business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, don't be a selfish bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: This should be something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you wanting it not legalized,
you wanting by not wanting cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of my listeners are going to want
cannabis legalized.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is I'm just kind of going off on
my own Rasta Jeff rant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those people that are selling cannabis
illegally and producing and hustling and
[SPEAKER_07]: flipping cannabis illegally that do not
want cannabis legalized.
[SPEAKER_07]: The people you are selling that cannabis
to are criminals and will go to jail if
[SPEAKER_07]: they are caught with the product you're
selling them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you seem to be supporting that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're putting your family, yourself,
your customers, everyone in danger because
[SPEAKER_07]: you're greedy and you want to have a
hustle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can kind of be a little bit hypocritical
sounding right now because I grow and
[SPEAKER_07]: produce cannabis, but I'm doing it fully
legal for a fully regulated facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a legal, legit job, which is
possible when you legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a time clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not looking over my shoulder because I
don't want it legalized so that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: have your own hustle or kind of being
stingy bitches and fucking it up for the
[SPEAKER_07]: rest of those that want the country that
wants legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Help us, support us out.
[SPEAKER_07]: What if you helped us legalize it and got
into the industry and used your hustler
[SPEAKER_07]: skills to good use and actually put some
tax money in and actually got a 401k and
[SPEAKER_07]: actually had some benefits and had
something that you could talk about to
[SPEAKER_07]: your family.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have to hide that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you can do what you want to do all
day and not have to risk everything you
[SPEAKER_06]: have to do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Being a drug dealer is only one skill.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't put that on a resume anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only do that for so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the days of the big trap house
grows and the people throwing out mad
[SPEAKER_07]: pounds and flipping packs, that's going
away in Colorado for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going away so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo is raining in hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other cities are also raining in very
hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that caught me about all the
recent news is that it's all headed to
[SPEAKER_06]: Florida and Texas and places far from
legalization because here the black market
[SPEAKER_06]: price of the pound doesn't make it worth
the effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not worth the effort and risk
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not enough profit margin in
between what it takes to produce it and
[SPEAKER_06]: distribute it in the profit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get back from doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to pay a trimmer and your
electricity.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're breaking even nowadays at the cost
of cannabis around here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to make a profit on it,
you've got to drive it far, far away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of lights and I run two of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's scary because you're currently
involved in the illegal side of things and
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't think there's going to be a
place for you in legalization,
[SPEAKER_06]: wise up, get involved with the
legalization effort in your area and make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that those efforts carve out a place
for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the ways Colorado really
fucked up is we didn't make, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: get my life in order badge for employees.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have previous felonies and stuff
like that, there's no reason you can't be
[SPEAKER_06]: a trimmer somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason you can't be working it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a trusty MED badge?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, something like a support and
a half badge or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what they would call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: White belt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read articles all the time of people
that have been involved in the black
[SPEAKER_06]: market for cannabis for years around the
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Picked up a couple of charges along the
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of that, they hop in the car,
they kind of abandon what little they had
[SPEAKER_06]: built up for a life, wherever they were,
come here, hoping to get into the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: and realize that we shut the door on all
those people right at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right off the bat, we said no felonies in
five years, no drug felonies in 10,
[SPEAKER_06]: end of story.
[SPEAKER_06]: That locked out a huge portion of people
that have been involved in the black
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of those people that are
trying to get their shit together should
[SPEAKER_06]: have a way to work in the legal industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something other than the local head
shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what a lot of people have had
to wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see them, they were at the
fucking starting line and someone pulled
[SPEAKER_07]: that trigger, bang, you can go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a couple of these people just leapt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see one seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: They already had the application ready to
go the day of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeds packaged.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeds packaged and everything was ready to
go and they were just ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were already behind the scenes with
some dispensary telling somebody what to
[SPEAKER_07]: do, guiding them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all they had to do was say,
this guy is here, we've got his brand,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just went fucking ape shit when
that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe Colorado should make a cannabis
council that you can appeal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly have no idea what we're gonna
do.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rules are changing in really weird
ways right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in a very real way, we're
inventing this shit as we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, there's no... Like in the last
month, we banned a whole bunch of edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't be certain shapes now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we let tourists buy four times what
they were currently allowed to buy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those two changes are in direct
opposition of each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: But are happening at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, very strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first couple of shops to really get
busted for violations are all going
[SPEAKER_06]: through their hearings.
[SPEAKER_06]: That process is being invented right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is gonna keep going on for at
least five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very fun time to live right here in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just founded a marijuana research
institute here.
[SPEAKER_06]: $1.2 million in marijuana taxes going to
our local university.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 900 from the state, 250 from our
local county.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to Colorado State
University here in Pueblo, right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: CSUP is it's known locally.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna be doing medical research
and social research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll finally start getting some hard
data as to what happens when you legalize
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana for all adults in the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of cool research taking place down
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where that came from,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went from talking about illegal growers
to the university testing and doing
[SPEAKER_07]: studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: To Cactus Cooler by whoever, Lindsey,
bought that from... I don't know which
[SPEAKER_06]: company made that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terbex.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was done by our... That's from us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought, but I didn't want
to say it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That Cactus Cooler cut is kind of
exclusive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was given a cut of that Cactus Cooler
and I was told don't let that out because
[SPEAKER_07]: this is the only place that has it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's ever seen out on the streets,
we know you let it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've got it in my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will never go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will get pollinated with shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: How long ago did I take that dad,
people?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can still taste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's delicious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to take a lot of credit for
that grow, but honestly, you could grow
[SPEAKER_07]: that string with dog poop and it'll come
out tasting delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's super flavorful, super terpe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the Cactus Cooler.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure where that one came from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an idea, but I don't want to be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know, email the show at... It's
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt knows who... No, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just... You gave me the layup,
so I threw it to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was grown by myself at Green and
Healthy, trimmed by our buddy,
[SPEAKER_07]: John Randalls Jr. Shout out Randalls.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I know you're listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy Monday, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you're back with me trimming.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's Monday, you're probably back with
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, you will be Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trimmed by Randalls.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was extracted by our friends
at Terpex.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure which one of the Terpy boys
ran it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either Shane, probably Shane, maybe Logan.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really nice job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they do pretty good work over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that, Shane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just the boys at Terp, but it was
grown well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was trimmed well and it was extracted
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it made it to the end of the dab rig
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting the system figured out over there
at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a nice grow setup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it took me... I think this is like...
Started pulling like the third harvest out
[SPEAKER_07]: of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first harvest, I didn't have full
control of the second harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't cut the clones, so they were a
little overgrown by the time I got to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're in clones that I cut myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're about to harvest all of that
stuff pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny will be there trimming it down
Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've switched nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were using... It was proprietary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't allowed to say before,
but since we switched, we were using a
[SPEAKER_07]: brand called MB Ferts, which they send us
just powders.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we would make the nutrients with
the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd fucking reconstitute... What's that
again?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it concentrate?
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd send us concentrate and then we'd
fucking dilute it, I guess is what we were
[SPEAKER_07]: doing with hot water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're using VegBloom, the entire
VegBloom line with a couple of other
[SPEAKER_07]: things mixed in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can see a huge difference from the
VegBloom line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those plants are beasting out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like a week ahead of the other
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look way fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask you that, but I didn't
know if you wanted to talk about that on
[SPEAKER_04]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of go by what Hunt says.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I can share and what I can't share.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since VegBloom helped us out quite a
bit, I'm all about giving VegBloom a shout
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus I see huge results.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can already see there are three
different sections of plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're like week four and then about
week six.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's another one that's fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can see looking at the VegBloom
versus the MB Ferts, the MB Ferts plants
[SPEAKER_07]: are almost ready to get cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: The VegBloom plants are in week four and
the buds are already as big as the final
[SPEAKER_07]: product on the MB Ferts table.
[SPEAKER_07]: So VegBloom is killing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely crushing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy to mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: They send you just bags of powder,
basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like you just got a bunch of
cocaine delivered and then you weigh it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes by weight per gallon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I weigh out approximately,
I think it's about 700 grams of each base.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got two different bases, a hard water
and a soft water, because our water is a
[SPEAKER_07]: certain condition.
[SPEAKER_07]: We mix them for the ideal results.
[SPEAKER_07]: We weigh out certain amounts on a scale
and then just drop it in the water and
[SPEAKER_07]: give it a good stir and it dissolves
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't chunk up my filters too badly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't clog up my sprinkler system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it seems to be working for what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they just got a huge free fucking
commercial from me, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to our friends at VegBloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: What that random giggle was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow, shout out to VegBloom.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I like the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd recommend it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's simple to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are four products.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a base.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, they have a foliar product that
I fucking hugely recommend.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Push, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got a base.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got Shine.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got Life and they've got Push.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things will make your plant super
happy and it's silly proof.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can overdo it, but it's silly proof
other than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to pull our best harvest ever
here pretty soon at Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I bet you are because you get to
sell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am because I get to consume some of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you do, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was about to say smoke, but that really
doesn't paint the full picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to dab it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to smell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was an awkward jiggle there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Lindsay needs a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just reached for it as you said
that that was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay came over and rolled up a big old
fat blunt and smoked that blunt to her
[SPEAKER_07]: face by herself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not even fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I offered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I was like, I know we jokingly
told Mike that I like faced a blunt in
[SPEAKER_04]: front of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, but we're not going to let
people think that I was that rude that I
[SPEAKER_04]: just came over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not into your flavored blunt wraps,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: No offense to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's those.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot you didn't like them the last
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have brought different ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like to smoke a blunt period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I knew you weren't going to smoke
one anyways.
[SPEAKER_07]: You wrap incense around it and I'm not
into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what it tastes like to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like strawberry incense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't I can't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had this epiphany the other day that
because I don't smoke cigarettes at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never smoked cigarettes in my life,
but I had this epiphany the other day that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually addicted to nicotine because
I smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, since I've been in Colorado,
I smoke a lot less blunts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoke a lot more hash now that I'm out
here because I have access to great hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I'm not going to dab poop
soup in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to poop soup in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like, you know, now that I'm here,
I smoke a lot more hash, but I realized
[SPEAKER_04]: the other day that I might actually need
to cut blunts out completely, which might
[SPEAKER_04]: really hurt me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been coughing quite a bit when you
smoke a blunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just like, maybe I might have to
actually stop smoking blunts for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like the dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just more economical.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more just less puffs on my lungs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like as a human, you probably get
like a set of tires.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get so many miles on your lungs,
probably get so many ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like if I take 37, then
somebody's looking at me for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just talking to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been staring right at her,
having a conversation with her for a
[SPEAKER_07]: minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I'd share with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with all of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing a lot of bonk hits lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been thinking about this though
because it is a little more expensive that
[SPEAKER_06]: way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it definitely eats up a lot more time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like imagine I consume a lot of hash and
imagine how much hash, how much flour I
[SPEAKER_07]: would have to consume to reach that level
that I get with smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can honestly smoke a half a gram to a
gram, gram of hash just in one sitting
[SPEAKER_07]: while we're just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a bunch of conversations about
potency taking place around the country
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of it's it's missing is
the stuff that 75 85% GHC that we have
[SPEAKER_06]: available to us here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not smoking a two gram blunt of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I say that out loud, it sounds
kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're taking a tiny little dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: 0.2 of a gram about the average size of a
dab around here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's so much smaller, so much
quicker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take one, but the show just
went super silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe it's time to start wrapping up
the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, maybe you can just wrap it up
real quick and then I'll take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys got any final words?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: The show is kind of bizarre.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just, you know, when you come into
dispensaries, just know what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to have, know what you're allowed
to get, you know, whether it's medical or
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: Know your limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Know what you're allowed to do as a
patient and as a member on the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: side.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, don't come in and ask stupid
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't say illegal things you're going to
do, you know, the whole spiel from this
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just really be conscious of yourself
and the way you're portraying yourself and
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be more conscious of yourselves in
the dispensaries, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That dab just hit you, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I was just like,
I could go, I could make this even longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, I just need to stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a coherent wrap up again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Jerry Springer's final thoughts is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, gosh, I can't believe I've been with
her.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys, it's that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The podcast is wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd be awesome if you go to iTunes,
go to the iTunes store, search for the
[SPEAKER_07]: girl from your heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Podcast, find the review section,
type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know what you think about the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are probably a couple hanging out
there that I need to read soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will get to those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise you when you're typing in a
comment, click on some stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get one to five stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on as many as you think I deserve.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to pander for five,
but you know, that's always what we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep us up to a solid five star rating.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else can you do if you want to
sponsor the show or if you've got a
[SPEAKER_07]: product you'd like to send me to review?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you send us a product, I will get the
product in the mail.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will unbox it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll turn on the microphones.
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't do the whole podcast spiel,
but I'll turn on the microphones.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll sit at the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever's here with me, oftentimes it's
Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll unwrap a product.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about it as we unwrap it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about how well it was packaged,
what the packaging looks like,
[SPEAKER_07]: how appealing the packaging is.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will take the package out, the product
out of the package.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll read the instructions so we can
figure out how to use the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get it charged up if we need to.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll press pause.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go smoke on our own.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once the thing's charged up, we'll come
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll use the device, whatever kind of toy
you send us, whatever you'd like reviewed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something to smoke down on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a charger.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I liked about the furniture
table.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was plug and play.
[SPEAKER_07]: The furniture table was a five star review
all the way around.
[SPEAKER_07]: That thing's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Chris Bobo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris, come home soon, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a product, we will do your
product justice.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do a little review.
[SPEAKER_06]: The better the product, the better the
review.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put it to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how to use products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how to set the settings to where
they need to be for my comfort level.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get it figured out and we'll use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need it back, let me know.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll ship the damn thing back to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a product that can be shipped
back, we'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a product you'd like us to
review, it's growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_07]: .com.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd love to check out your toys,
your inventions, whatever you need put out
[SPEAKER_07]: there on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people will hear about your
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike and I, maybe Lindsay, whoever else is
hanging out, we'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do hit a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even like to talk about how many
people we reach when I have guests here
[SPEAKER_07]: because it freaks you guys out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You go silent and get all pale.
[SPEAKER_06]: This week in particular, I got some
feedback from a listener that mentioned
[SPEAKER_06]: that last week was as high as they'd ever
heard me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, we topped it up, Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for listening, Ross, to Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to everybody that listens to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like all the interaction, all the
support.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been getting tons more emails and
messages.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of it is because we are now
on Tok Radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people are tuning in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going into Tok Radio and discovering
the podcast there because I'm finding
[SPEAKER_07]: totally new people in my inbox that I've
never listened to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just discovered there's a whole other
fucking inbox on my Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got three inboxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like the request one.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another one too, like the filtered
one or something that I've never seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to show me that black hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how it popped up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I need to go on my computer
and open up Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took a screenshot to be like,
where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: So that I could try to find it when I had
more time to surf.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so if you have sent me a
Facebook message at my personal account,
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize that I haven't gotten back to
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't suck that bad at life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody bitched at me for not getting
back to them right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get no shit, 25 to 50, maybe 100
Facebook messages and emails a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's hard to get to all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there'll be a random day of the week
when I have maybe 10 or 20 minutes to
[SPEAKER_07]: chill out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm eating lunch, eating a sandwich,
and I'll reply to six emails right then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, as quickly as I
can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are the six that I got.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll get the next six next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I mean, I had a lot of shit going
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my rant on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, send me an email,
growfromyourheart.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll review your products.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I was with all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even have notes in front of me and
I know it'll land back on the map.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_07]: Any announcements or anything you guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Elevate.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Elevate.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need glass, if you need smoking
accessories, if you want to see cool
[SPEAKER_07]: glass, you don't even have to buy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a glass gallery.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go take a look.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will not be mad at you for looking
and not buying.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go see Inky the dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: Inky's a sweet puppy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go give him a scratch on the forehead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he's probably afraid of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll run from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's scared shitless of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But to go in there and see Inky,
go see all the lovely ladies, go tell them
[SPEAKER_07]: what's up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Elevate glass, 517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're on Tejon and you want to park
and it's all crowded on Tejon and you
[SPEAKER_07]: don't have money for the meter,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn left or right on Moreno.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's either Monterey or Moreno.
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts with an M right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Free parking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't pay for parking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go park for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's that bar across the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a live band.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always all crowded.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to park right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't hit the meters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just turn left or turn right after you
pass the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all legit, sunshiny out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go take a little walk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not trying to tell you what to do,
but hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save some money.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would Joey Diaz say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a risk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbus did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, that's all the podcast we've got
for you this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank my friends for coming and
hanging out with me for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've felt a little bit shitty the past
couple of days and some good vibes with
[SPEAKER_07]: some good friends will definitely cheer
you up, make you forget that you didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for coming, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take some vitamins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might have wanted to warn you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might have wanted to say that before you
came over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might have to chug that orange juice in my
fridge now, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody out there, take some vitamins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking hydrate this summer, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're at a festival raging,
beer is not hydration.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Pepper is not hydration.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, I hate to break it to you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain Dew will not hydrate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That will keep you from diabetes and make
you sweaty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been going through so much water
lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drink water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydrate yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydrate your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're out there in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been special hot lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you all are staying cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to all the outdoor farmers that
are out there getting burnt as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're out working outdoors right now,
man, God bless you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm spoiled.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in a big indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 74 degrees all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super hot when I go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty hot between the facility and
when the air conditioner starts kicking in
[SPEAKER_07]: in my car.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much where I am.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the same struggle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike's got pretty much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like 83 for a minute in the bud
room the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 105 outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took a minute to get the AC powered up
enough to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had to use the go outside and
really bake yourself to make it tolerable
[SPEAKER_06]: inside for the next half hour trick in a
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to break that one out again this
week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got real deep and serious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost feel like we should do something
fun right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a sticker pack thing that's just
really easy to do for the two people that
[SPEAKER_06]: are still listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got some stickers to donate?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I got like $4 so that y'all can
pick some up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of prize do you want to offer on
this episode?
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally have mad stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've got sticker packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, but I have
plenty of stuff I can throw into this too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I do have a stack of stickers I
could throw into this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's make some rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do people have to do, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we've got an hour and five
minutes, and if they're still listening,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're dedicated listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet all three of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet all three of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do they have to tweet us?
[SPEAKER_07]: They like it when we run.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can make one tweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: One tweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tag us all three.
[SPEAKER_07]: The traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: The travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_07]: The travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't even let you guys do your plugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: The travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nemo punk 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't tag my personal one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to follow the instructions at GFYH
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm writing that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to remember that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be high and forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to tweet all three of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: The travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nemo punk 15 at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet us.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to tweet us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we ask a question in the first
person who answers?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's not really a first person,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just like one that will be
listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: This kind of went everywhere.

were like, well, I'm looking for a
[SPEAKER_06]: dedicated show about growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

ramble are still here.

when you ramble, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hasn't this been just one?
[SPEAKER_07]: But they got to tweet all three of us.

ramble.

could say something in the message also if
