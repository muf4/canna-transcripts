[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start the podcast off by
giving a giant thank you shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Dinks for nothing for the perfect
podcast intro track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fits very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the point of the show where I talk
about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking ridiculous dabs of holy
fuck full spectrum extract from green dot
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of sex on the beach and
halo on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as pina colada and
fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very unique description,
but I am going to agree when you inhale
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a fruitiness that pina colada
coconut kind of pineapple taste that
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical flavor overwhelms my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, my tongue goes dry and
it tastes like fruity fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely agree with a pina colada
and fuel flavor on the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the THC level is 59.29% and
non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at green dot
labs for the delicious, holy fuck full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of holy fuck, holy fuck you
guys, it is super hot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the hottest day that we have
experienced here in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this summer, and I am feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has led up to a bunch of great
podcast questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a lot of other people
across the country, across the world are
[SPEAKER_00]: having heat issues and their grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, we are going to talk
about air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to address a couple of air
conditioning questions before we get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.

[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the Patreon question
part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a question here that comes from
our friend, Karen Crawford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen, thank you for the continued Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, first off,
can I just ask how the hell you manage to
[SPEAKER_00]: do all you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing, breeding, consulting,
multiple podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emails, social media, sales, dabbing,
and somewhere in there, you got to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a personal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you do it, but I do know
we all appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing, Karen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has become my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I do for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just something I do as a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not just playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just hanging out in the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fucking immersed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake up and it's cannabis time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fall asleep and it was cannabis time all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a seed breeder, owning a seed
company is not a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something, if you want to breed
and put seeds to market at the level,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I do, it is not a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you have to run like a
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a farm and a farm business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be operated as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to take a lot of days off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying this is a lifestyle and
I'm dedicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be successful as a breeder,
successful as a content provider,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have got to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be on top of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't put out a show, I disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't put out a new strain,
I disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constant work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you're going to do it,
know that it's going to be a lifestyle,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just a job, not just a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is what I have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't grow, none of this would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing and playing the drums are two
things that I have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't do those, something would go
wrong with me mentally and physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A screw would come undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs would pop out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love making new seeds and growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I love seeing you guys have success
in your garden with the great things I
[SPEAKER_00]: breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to big grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me up to tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see what all these other people
bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get to play with it and learn how
to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Owners get these big ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told them to buy some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought it because they had money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investor was like, we don't know what
we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that told them to buy it
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just some fucking dude they knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need somebody to work it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me and I get to go play with so
many great toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps my sword sharp, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am here on this show a minimum of
twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on improving and increasing
the amount of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the Embracing Organics show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appear as a guest on quite a few other
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Scotty Real and the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on their show quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do as many social media
appearances as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed some dental work and I got it
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's do some fucking shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so shy about the face anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, where are we in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Emails, social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first half of my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake up and answer emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I try to catch up with them before I
go to bed once more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been slacking on social media,
but I do try to keep a presence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys always dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in between there, you got to
have some sort of a personal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have a little bit of a personal
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Mike around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt comes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few people come and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's not quarantine time,
we do Zoom and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, this social media stuff,
my Instagram Live and the things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that is a lot of my social
interaction because I don't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to go explore and do a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that I do interact with,
you are my social interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambly from that holy fuck dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got a brain bake from the
heat and then also I'm fucking extra baked
[SPEAKER_00]: from the holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move into the actual
important part of this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen, thank you for noticing all of the
hard work I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm a caregiver in
Michigan and a couple of months ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were kind enough to answer a question
I had about extracts and why you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, this time I have a grow room
question that I definitely need your
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, indoors, I have a 12 by 20 flower
room in a basement with heating and
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling vented in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, over the past couple of weeks,
shit has been hot as hell outside and the
[SPEAKER_00]: house AC isn't cooling the room enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel your pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 10 o'clock at night as I'm recording
and it is still 91 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the cooler on all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is finally cool in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been cool until right about now
at 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel your pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole country is getting hot right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running six to eight plants under
four HLG 550s and two Bestva 2000 watt
[SPEAKER_00]: reflector series budget blurples to vary
the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I run my lights at night
from 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: with it being in the mid nineties,
every day temps are raising between 85 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 88, even with my hurricane 20 inch pro
velocity fan on them and the dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: set to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told us what kind of light she's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what size the space is.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got the right idea running the
lights from 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cooler at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to fight the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to cool the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, electricity is cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many electrical companies will charge you
a premium price for the electric during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day because everybody's functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the businesses need power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cheaper at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hurricane 20 inch pro fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, here's a note you need to keep in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans do not create cool air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They circulate air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's getting too hot from a heat
source, you need something to battle the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan doesn't battle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something to fight the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making heat, you need something
to make cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got 58 or 85 to 88 degrees,
60% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm afraid my girls are going to
get very unhappy soon if this continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have purchased a winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's W-H-Y-N-T-E-R.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's said winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have seen those when you're
shopping, a winter 14,000 BTU ARC SH
[SPEAKER_00]: portable AC unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have no clue how to vent this
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These units are great if you were in the
right environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have access to a window unit,
if you don't have a window to put a unit
[SPEAKER_00]: in, these will work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of guidance to install
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can help you there because I do have a
room with, it may be the exact same air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner, if not a similar model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a winter 14,000 BTU portable air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a small 11 by 30 inch window that I
could use, but I'm not nervous about
[SPEAKER_00]: number one bugs, number two light leaks
and number three odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all valid concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've had 10 different people give
me 10 different answers on this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to fuck this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the best possible way to do
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping all these things in mind and with
the knowledge that I have a 70 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: woman living very closely to the side,
that it will be vented out who has already
[SPEAKER_00]: complained to me about the smell of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that crazy old lady is going to be the
bane of your existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, she's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I apologize for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you got to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to burn one with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you saw me spit on the microphone,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go burn one with her and make
her your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give her some topicals, make her feel
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for my lack of knowledge when
it comes to HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't apologize for lack of any knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you know plenty of shit because
you've made it this far in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is well typed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be simple, but for someone with
varied responses is sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure as hell am concerned and I want it
done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to keep overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One solution was to remove the window,
replace a piece of plywood pre-cut for the
[SPEAKER_00]: hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you are on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just start talking about how I would
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a very similar window setup
with a very similar air conditioner in the
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not use plywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opted to use, I'm not sure what it's
supposed to be for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a construction guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a handyman.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not good at HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the shit at Lowe's is
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I point and grunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use some blue insulation board.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's for insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got a diamond shape and it
may say DuPont in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get the one with the silver
reflective on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer it with the silver reflective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy the foam board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is one and a half to two inches
thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it in different thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my basement window, the window well is
quite wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as wide as the basement foundation,
as wide as the house was built.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass and the frame are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply popped out of the square where
the window goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut a square of that blue foam
insulation and I popped it in there as
[SPEAKER_00]: tight as it would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I used GorillaCock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spray foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to ruin your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some clothes you can destroy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tie up your hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got dreadlocks, get that shit
out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GorillaCock is a mess and it gets
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen saw photos of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I could not clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more careful than I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal all the way around that window with
the GorillaCock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make multiple layers of duct tape
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do the duct tape yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do that next, but seal it
with duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take your ducts from the air
conditioner and trace the size of the hole
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a hole and cut that hole out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I choose to do is I went to the
grow store and the ducts I am using are
[SPEAKER_00]: six inches wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air conditioner I purchased has a six
inch duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed a six inch metal flange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a piece about this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding up my hands probably 10 or 11
inches, maybe 12 inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a piece of sheet metal ducting
wrapped into a duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's six inches in diameter and 10 to 12
inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I push that through the foam board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measure it, cut a hole, push that
through the foam board, tape that securely
[SPEAKER_00]: into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foam board is taped into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also held in with GorillaCock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put the metal in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I attach the ducting to the metal
just to give it something to attach to,
[SPEAKER_00]: something strong to support on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I duct tape the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to catch up into your message and
see where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of lost my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Window replaced with a piece of plywood
pre-cut for the hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pre-cut or you can post-cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was easier for me to cut once it was up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hang the thing and measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was easy, but cut it as you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to screw the window into the
frame and caulk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the foam insulation because it's
easier to cut and it's insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already insulated, but the good part
about the wood is it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lightproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to duct tape the inside of my room
to make sure no light comes through when I
[SPEAKER_00]: use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Caulked, but how do I filter it to ensure
bugs and or light can't get through the
[SPEAKER_00]: intake or outtake hoses?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question and a very
good challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those hoses spits out heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually put black pantyhose over the end
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put pantyhose just like a condom and
duct tape it in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll blow and you'll see that flap in the
wind a little bit, but the pantyhose
[SPEAKER_00]: prevents anything from coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not use the duct in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use the duct out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I'm not pulling the air from
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the air conditioner struggle a
little bit because you're using that
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's 120 outside and it's only 85
in my room, I feel it's easier for the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner to use that air that's already
in the room and then it just blows the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less circulation and cycling going
through my machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less ducting that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use that second hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just leave it open and I put a filter
over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pantyhose is the cheap way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're confident that it's not going to
heat up enough to cause a problem on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pantyhose, by the time it gets down that
far, it should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you put your hand over and
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I filter it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pantyhose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super high tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a million dollar trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pantyhose, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or ma'am, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't call you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the bros by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the grow bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but respect either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say this out loud,
but mites are the only grower problem I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you'll get mites eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do I go about this smell venting
out and blasting the intake out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hoses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think it cycles much air from
your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the two hose model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are going to be pulling air in
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go over the compressor and
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to use both hoses and then it
creates a loop and that air doesn't touch
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You aren't pulling air from the grow and
pushing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just blowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a loop and that should work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make any promises that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the two hoses and you create a
continuous loop and the air doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: sucked from your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The odor doesn't get sucked and blown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need another carbon filter in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a carbon filter with a blower in
it right in front of the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help stir the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that'll suck out a bunch of aroma
and odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do the loop, I don't think
you're going to get much aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I am, I don't worry too much about
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neighbors know who I am by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes on to say, I've emailed you a few
pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did check out the emails and I did
reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for holding the email paper in
front of the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't paying any attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching the video, I do
apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to be a better podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did check out the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did reply with a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind enough to make a quick video of
my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it helped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says mites are the only problem I
haven't dealt with over the years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to not deal with mites is to have
a solid integrated pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some sort of security so that those
mites cannot arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't allow them to even show their faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either sprays or predators, however you
choose to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your message, you were concerned that
maybe they'll come in the cracks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll come in those little holes
where you just hung up that board.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come in through the
miniature cracks in the walls in your
[SPEAKER_00]: house anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're there, they're coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you've got a pest
management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good point you bring up is also
with a unit on the floor, the hoses don't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite reach without being fully stretched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I need additional six inch venting or
five inch?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using five inch on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different model than I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoses are working properly or would it
be better to prop it up on cement blocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got mine raised up on three cinder
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it up kind of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat blows at the canopy or the air,
the cool blows at the canopy of my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right across the top, it kind of goes
between the lights and the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the hottest part is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pushes that heat right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also up on the buckets, I am allowed to,
these air conditioners will create
[SPEAKER_00]: condensation and runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a drain in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pee a little bit occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run that tube into a bucket between those
cinder blocks that you've got it raised up
[SPEAKER_00]: on or however you raise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinder blocks are my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably weighs about 130 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful lifting it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it doesn't roll off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put duct tape flaps on the wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cooler is sitting on four cinder
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it four or is it two?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only this wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two cinder blocks are stacked
up three high, but I took just little
[SPEAKER_00]: mounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made speed bumps out of duct tape on the
cinder blocks so that the thing cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the wheels pivot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turned it toward the wheels are
facing different directions so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have an easy way to turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It weighs 130 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could fall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could fall on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it falls, that ducting that it's
attached to is going to yank the window
[SPEAKER_00]: cover off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everybody can see right into your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lights are on, if it's hot outside,
everyone's seeing your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that fucking thing doesn't fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, do raise it up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it came with the drain tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it's got a little spout in the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift up the cover on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just leave it uncovered all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's got a tube that hangs into a
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fills up about five gallons maybe every
week or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never let it get full because I can see
it when I go in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dump it occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say you can use that water
to water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could not, but there could be shit
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if there's any more to this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says again, thanks for all you do Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen, thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been helping me out on Patreon for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why your message got moved
directly to the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it was perfectly timed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot as shit outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's rubbing their forehead all day
today everywhere I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, I popped some lemon Jeffrey
and orangegasm seeds that you were kind
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to get to me when seeds here now
was sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, I'm not sure what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing Operation Grow with the
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is referring to Operation Grow,
which is sponsored by iReGenetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: PL Grow Systems, New Millennium Nutrients,
AutoPots, and possibly another company,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I have forgotten, but we are all,
they are all growing orangegasm and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are all using a PL Grow minder unit to
monitor the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has an AutoPot system to feed
the plants and everybody got a box of New
[SPEAKER_00]: Millennium to provide nutrition to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are all meeting every Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I'm in Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are, but convert
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever time it is, wherever you are,
join us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time and we talk about Operation
Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time we are growing orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six growers that all started at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all on the same phase of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flipped into flower on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the coming Saturday will be the first
grow report of the plants being into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen, I'm glad you are following along
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're learning a lot about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of interesting information
on the last couple of episodes and I love
[SPEAKER_00]: your enthusiasm about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it up, stick around, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got more questions,
please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been learning about her
alongside the boys and I'm stoked to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited that you're joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know that more people from
this show are watching that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I invite you come check out
Operation Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be Operation Grow 2019 because that
is when it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't get fooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still up to date and staying
current.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This says, feel free to use my name if you
want to include it on an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical caregiver out here and I am
proud in or out and proud in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends out there
at Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan is killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the wild, wild west out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen, you keep it up, keep crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got more grow questions,
please send them right my direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep moving because I do have
another great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also is about air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Monsoon Moon 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Monsoon Moon 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Ross, to Jeff, I'm a long
time listener and I love your show because
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets me through the day and teaches me
things at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have found the catch, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a good time and it's
getting you through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at the office, you're in the truck,
you're doing whatever you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not thinking about that crap
because I'm teaching you something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm just wondering if
you can give me some advice on my mini
[SPEAKER_00]: split ACs for my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to speak up before we get too
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an HVAC technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I say is bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all from what I've seen and heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a pro in this department,
but we're going to get through this
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have framed up a veg and flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flower room is five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a normal bedroom and I have an
active air take, an active intake and
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust in both of my rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got active in and active out on
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intakes pull air from the room outside
the grow area and the exhaust go to an
[SPEAKER_00]: empty space under the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're pulling from the outside the
grow area and then it's going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space and then under the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really only worried about cooling the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says the bedroom doesn't matter so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first correction I'm going to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how hot your flower room,
your bedroom is getting, but so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people overlook the importance of building
a quality bedroom that their grow is not
[SPEAKER_00]: as successful as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bedroom is equally as successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important if not more important than
your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a proper veg cycle, your plants
will be weak and spindly and not prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: for a proper flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that Monsoon Moon 420 is
doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have a perfect setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to make any adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that everybody knows
that veg is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often see people invest a lot of money
in the flower room and then I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, let me see your veg space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, I bought a five by five
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, so you spent thousands of
dollars on this fancy flower room and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to start everything off in a
five by five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's cool, but I think you should
have veg as the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the best lights, the best
ventilation, the best CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want all of the best in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like training.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to train the best you can before
you go into battle and battle is the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be ready to flower and give
me what I need before I put them into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think veg is just as important and
matters as much if not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've already got a
dialed in veg space and it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: that you upgrade it, but I want to make
sure that you understand it does matter as
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you think it's better to have
the head of the AC inside the flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: or outside of the flower room blowing near
an intake?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your veg space and your flower
space inside of this bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing air into the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put the head of your mini split
inside the room, you cannot have different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures in your veg tent and in your
flowering tent because you're cooling the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and sucking that air into the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever temperature you get the room
in the middle, we call that a long room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that long room is temperature to,
that's what temperature is going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into your flower and your veg spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put the head of your mini split
inside the flower space, you can dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a mini split.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have two heads, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't you put one in each?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what unit you bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them have two heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's a split, split over here,
split it over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it a split?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the heads outside are in here and
the units outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, bro, not an HVAC guy,
but so that is your main thing to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to climb and control the room
and move that air into both of the tents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want the flowering room to get
the focus of the air conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, if I go ahead and
install it straight into the flower room,
[SPEAKER_00]: will I still need to use my intake or
exhausts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because you are not replacing the
fresh air, the CO2, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no air flow because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need, unless you seal up the
room and supplement CO2, you do still need
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust and intake because you'll stifle
the CO2 and oxygen in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running CO2 and you've got
enough CO2 to supplement to keep those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants happy, you can seal it up and move
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could not use those intakes,
but if you don't have supplemental CO2 in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and I mean like 14 to 1600 PPMs,
if you're not supplementing high,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't seal it up and do keep using the
intakes and outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I need to exhaust the smell out of
the room at certain intervals?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've got a carbon filter hooked
up to your outtakes, all of your outtakes
[SPEAKER_00]: and your exhausts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're going under the house,
I would still put a carbon filter on all
[SPEAKER_00]: of your outtakes and just run those
exhausts 24 hours a day to keep that air
[SPEAKER_00]: moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to turn off the fans on
the intake because that outtake,
[SPEAKER_00]: the exhaust will passively pull air in
through the intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get enough replacement air
through displacement, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your space, but most of the
time, typically that's what will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're running your carbon
filter on your exhaust to keep that air
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last part of the question says
also, what material could I use to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: good seal on the doors to my room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend weather stripping,
dude, or the flaps that they sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that flap that goes on the bottom to
cover the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower that as low as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also use weather stripping on the
inside of the door to where it seals real
[SPEAKER_00]: tight up against the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sell other flaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're near the weather stripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to your local hardware store,
they're like six foot sections of weather
[SPEAKER_00]: stripping that'll screw in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the door will close and fit right up
against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put this one stripping on one side,
you put this shit on the other side and
[SPEAKER_00]: they fit up perfectly together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit overkill in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather stripping does very well in
any facility, any grow that I've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to cool that flower room,
drop the head in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to cool both rooms,
put the head of the air conditioner in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use those exhausts with carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not running CO2, you may not
need to use the intake fans, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the amount of air you're
putting in and the amount of air you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the fans the same size?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any sort of displacement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want negative or positive pressure
in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things you can adjust at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always use a carbon filter and put those
weather stripping on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I didn't write down the start
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who we don't
need to mention their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are, but it says,
what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you for some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, we spoke last a little bit about
getting in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sure you get hundreds of emails
from growers like this, but I hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider this one different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I've been growing cannabis for
close to two years consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been for off and on a little bit
longer due to being in an area where it is
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But decriminalization for possession puts
me at risk for daily for myself and my
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of going fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person, basically they're in an
area where they have commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, but they cannot afford
licensing and they kind of want to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I wanted to get a backstory to
you, but then it says, do you know of any
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities that are looking to hire?
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I have already discussed and
she's fine with me having to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know of someone or anybody who
needs help or wants help trimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: propagating, transplanting should all even
sweep the floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically this person is looking for a job
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate to be this guy, but there
aren't any cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs popping open at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the big facilities have gone on a
skeleton crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they used to have six guys,
now they got three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they used to have 10 dudes,
now they've got four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really minimized staff so that we're
not getting as many people sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trim crew is minimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stores are down to minimal staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately there is not much hiring
happening in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics specifically is a very
small operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People seem to think, and I love that
we've built this illusion that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get a couple of people to help
me package things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One or two people have volunteered and
been paid to put seeds, the bubbles into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cardboard packs, but I touch all the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get very minimal help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some shipping help and some
packaging help, but that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my helpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know who you are, not ignoring
you, but 99.9% of I read genetics is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't need too much more help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't hire anybody to give them a
reliable income or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately I don't have any good
advice for you on the hiring part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is parched.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I was stuttering a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a drink and I'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now I'm ready for another long
ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that there are producers in your
area getting licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: My suggestion is you said you cannot come
up with the money to get your own license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to one of those people and apply there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good background in a commercial
cultivation area where you already are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a family, you've got a lady,
you've got a baby on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not uproot you for a hopeful career
when maybe you can find a career right
[SPEAKER_00]: there in your own backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to one of those facilities that is
producing, go to the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: go everywhere and apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is make a good resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a resume just like you would apply
for any other position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also add that you were a passionate
cannabis cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dress decently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a grow position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cultivation position, but you're
not showing up to grow weed at the
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing up for an interview at the
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is my rambly advice for that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more advice for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more questions, please send
them my way and thanks for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, this last email from this show
is a very, very important message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to make sure to say this one nice
and clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Thor and it
says more white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all it says more white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike, the people have requested your
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: More white Mike, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I love having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been recording at random fucking
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we will get white Mike back on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll message him as soon as I'm done here
and I'll just say podcast with a question
[SPEAKER_00]: mark and we'll work it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for not having him here for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just been trying to get podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cranked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you guys love white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get better at being an
interviewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the best interviewer on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I run people over because I've
got a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how I want to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to become a better
interviewer, a better podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have more guests on my show via
zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that aren't just my good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Jesse comes over, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like hanging out with my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Mike is here, that's just like
hanging out with my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no work to that, but I want to be
able to interview and hang out more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortably with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I can do that is by
interviewing and hanging out comfortably
[SPEAKER_00]: with more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like your recommendations and
suggestions, who you would like to see me
[SPEAKER_00]: have on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you think would make a great guest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your recommendations via email or
Twitter.

at hotmail.com on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know who you would like to see on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm comfortable, I'll work my way up
to more intimidating guests and we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: some people on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to some guests on the podcast
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I've got for you for this
episode.
