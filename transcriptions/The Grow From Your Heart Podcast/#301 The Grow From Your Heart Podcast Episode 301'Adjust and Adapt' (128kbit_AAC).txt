[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call these Thursday episodes,
the Thursday quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: These quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the hella dank seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at dank seed
dot store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on with the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for a Thursday quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these episodes by letting
you know what I am smoking and it's a sad,
[SPEAKER_00]: sad day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished this container,
the last container of the Skywalker OG
[SPEAKER_00]: live batter from Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick moment of silence to this empty jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a trusty jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a worthy jar and it served a great
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this jar is empty and it will be
retired to the graveyard of empty hash
[SPEAKER_00]: jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skywalker OG I'll miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was some good shit you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet Elijah has got a small tear in his
eye also hearing that it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to dab the fuck out on that
Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasted a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of it and now it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, the Skywalker was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously got me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nice and high having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I want to make a
correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, if you listen to
number 300, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said that Art Bell and George Norrie
and Coast to Coast may have been the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that wasn't a podcast,
but it was what I thought may be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time I've ever heard of a podcast.
I mean, it was a podcast that was a show
that was a show that meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always the type of show to have that
platform, that long extended platform to
[SPEAKER_00]: break the basic AM radio kind of a mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I was listening to the
podcast and editing it came to me that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was somebody else that I should give
sort of a shout out, some tribute to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's ironic because he did kind of
pave the way for podcasting and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: never a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually despises podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about Howard Stern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard Stern was a radio DJ that broke all
of his own rules, who pushed the limits,
[SPEAKER_00]: who ended up with his own show,
who ended up with his own TV show,
[SPEAKER_00]: who ended up with a movie after him,
who is still on SiriusXM, making tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: money, basically doing podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, Howard Stern may be the OG
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's funny that Howard hates
podcasting, but it makes sense to me
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to bust his ass and get on the
radio and fight with radio politics and
[SPEAKER_00]: business politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know anything about the radio
and if you know anything about Howard
[SPEAKER_00]: Stern, you saw all the stuff he had to
battle to become Howard Stern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to go buy some toys and plug
them in and just run my mouth into a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone and post it to iTunes and hope
to get listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much simpler now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand why Howie despises
podcasts, but he is kind of the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: podcaster because he set the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He broke the mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed us that we could do different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Howard Stern, even though
you despise podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're the OG of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely change radio and
broadcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we owe a shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going or this is not
going to be a quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, I'm talkative today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be about adapting
and adjusting as a cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, being a cannabis teacher,
an educator, I come on my podcast and I
[SPEAKER_00]: try to teach you guys how to grow cannabis
in the best way possible, how to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of your garden the best way possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are no instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I say is basically a
suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow my suggestions and it
should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine out of 10 times it will work,
but I don't know your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, the only, if you ask me a question,
the only info I have is those two
[SPEAKER_00]: paragraphs you sent me and you may have
left some things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be things you didn't even think
about mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be something that I can't see
because I'm not in the grow room that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see because you don't know to look
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So helping you guys out, everything that I
say is kind of just going on the fly by
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're telling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to be able to adjust and
adapt to not having real instructions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what strain you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every strain is going to require different
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend specific pH ranges and
feeding ranges, but I try to give a range
[SPEAKER_00]: because each strain is going to want
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strain may want something different
in a different grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an LED light, you may have
to grow differently than if you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS light or if you've got a ceramic metal
halide light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we're reading in the
books, everything that we're reading on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottles, all of the instructions
should be taken as suggestions when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like being a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors are always practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're practicing growing cannabis because
each plant we see is like a new patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body chemistry is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next guy's body chemistry is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people do you know that can smoke
way more or way less than you and get way
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because our bodies are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adjust and adapt
to each plant, to each environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: to each situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different strains are going to want
different feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush and Sour Diesel and Super Silver
Haze, they're going to want completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different feeds, environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be treated completely
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes at different stages of your
grow, your plants are going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: different amounts of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adapt and adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're used to giving this plant a
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you see something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to figure out,
do I need to give it a gallon and a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter or three gallons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get stuck into your routines and
patterns because the bottle says,
[SPEAKER_00]: the instruction book says, they don't have
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take all of the instructions as
suggestions when it comes to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, each different strain is going to
want different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each different phenotype of that strain is
going to want different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll find a phenotype
that is, this is kind of a typical thing
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will be taller and skinnier.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will be shorter and more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing mommy and daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want different things and
you're going to have to adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I run a phenohunt the first
time, those plants all get the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for the sake of science so that I can see
what I've got so that every plant gets
[SPEAKER_00]: treated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dialed in basic feed regimen,
a good light schedule and a good room so
[SPEAKER_00]: that all those plants get the good basic
treatment that I know works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I run all of those plants under the
same conditions in the same environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can see what performs ideally in the
ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can select the keepers,
the two possibly three keepers out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually out of a 10 pack I find one to
three that I like to keep and run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will, I have seen what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they are keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them grow once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took plenty of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid attention to which one stretches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid attention to which one stays squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can adjust and adapt my next grow to
grow those plants properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't always follow what it says on
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't always follow what it says on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't always follow what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine times out of 10 I'm going to steer
you the right direction, but you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind that I'm human and I may make
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep in mind the only
information I've got to go by is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have told me and also whatever I give you,
the advice I give you, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to adjust and adapt it to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to use your best
judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to use your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to use your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to use your sense of
touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, maybe even use your sense of taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use all your senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got eyes, ears, nose, mouth and
touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use all your senses in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and smell it, look at it,
taste it, touch it, listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's anything to listen
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are making noise,
you're doing something wrong, listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you guys, you know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the book says, give it a gallon of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You poured in a gallon of water and that
plant went crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go pick up that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too heavy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the plant look like it's too dry or
too wet?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adjust and you're
going to have to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about things like, I talk about
popping the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grab a portion of the stem and
you grab it another inch above that and
[SPEAKER_00]: you twist opposite directions and it makes
this noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your sticks will make that noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it doesn't tip over sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're twisting, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just twist it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're working with, let's say,
Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream has tight node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows really long, strong branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream, you could pop the shit out of
it all over the place and it'll be just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost Dog is kind of stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets kind of tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be careful where you crack her
because if you do her too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: she'll start getting kind of droopy and
get mad at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same strains, Ghost Dog and Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream supports itself like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream, you don't need a lot of
netting, a lot of stakes, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the buds are going to get big,
but if you don't have them, the buds will
[SPEAKER_00]: hold themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost Dog, you better have three layers of
trellising because they're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: tipping over at week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are going to get floppy and
they just can't support themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adjust and adapt
because you've got different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always going to be science,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a life of their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to fight it and don't get sucked
into your routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get sucked into the plant's routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in the rhythm with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you get to the grow at eight
in the morning doesn't mean those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: need water at eight in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not dry, let them wait till
noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're still a little wet,
maybe let them wait till three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't force feed them if they're not ready
because it's on your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like if I keep
rambling, this episode will not be a
[SPEAKER_00]: quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Jade
and also a shout out to Maddie E.
