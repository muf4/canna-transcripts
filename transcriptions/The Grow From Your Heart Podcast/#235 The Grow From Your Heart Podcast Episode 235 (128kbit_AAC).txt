[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 235 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: For letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat, Kuth and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm in a good mood
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure why, but I am not
going to question it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have something to do with this
Sour Joker live batter I just took a
[SPEAKER_02]: gigantic dab of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how much I love sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a podcast listener and you
listen to my show, you know that I love to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke these sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now the Sour Joker is doing
something to my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's let that dab
sink in for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to brag a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the last episode, I talked about going
to see Steve Simone at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me tell you, it was better than I
had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drove up to Denver and I met up with the
always lovely, always beautiful Miss Jenny
[SPEAKER_02]: Beth.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was in Denver doing some Denver stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her and I met up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have got a little stoned in a
parking garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have taken some ridiculous sized
dabs in a parking garage before we went to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got super dabbed out and we headed
into ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the way to ComedyWorks,
I tweeted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I am driving 125 miles to see
Steve Simone talk about Chinese food
[SPEAKER_02]: because Steve Simone does a bit about
Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Steve Simone retweeted it and liked it
and replied with, I can't wait to see you,
[SPEAKER_02]: which had me excited because I met Steve
Simone a couple of times and we've hung
[SPEAKER_02]: out, but we've never really interacted a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did, however, send me a letter and some
stickers in the mail a little while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he knows I exist and we have
interacted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent the tweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: He liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He replied.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got there, they walked me in the
always lovely, always beautiful Miss Jenny
[SPEAKER_02]: Beth right up to the front because I get
these amazing front row seats because my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends at ComedyWorks take great care of
me because I have taken great care of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go up front and Steve Simone is in
front of the stage, like setting up his
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone and making sure everything's
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sees me and he goes, hey,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave me a hug and told me that he
loved me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I love you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was the drive?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told him it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, all right, man,
I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had to disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went backstage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another opener whose name I
cannot recall right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opener was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main opener, kind of the host of the
show, he was funny, but he told a joke
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a ripoff from Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody listens to the podcast
frequently, you know I'm a comedy nerd.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I listen to a lot of comedy and
you were never going to tell a Joey
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Diaz joke and it's going to slide
by me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy made a joke about being allergic
to peanuts and he said, how are we going
[SPEAKER_02]: to beat ISIS if we can't beat a peanut?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a fucking Joey Diaz ripoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also heard him say it in a live comedy
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: My advice to you is if you're an up and
coming comedian, don't ruin your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your fucking career by stealing somebody
else's joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude had me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said a Joey Diaz joke and lost
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, after that guy was a comedian by
the name of Brant Tobler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brant Tobler did not steal any material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brant Tobler was fucking hilarious the
whole show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude had me laughing my ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being down there in the front row,
you get a lot of interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they look you straight in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make sure that you're laughing
because that's the only way they know if
[SPEAKER_02]: the jokes are going well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they pay a lot of attention to my
laughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to laugh and let him know,
hey, bro, you're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brant Tobler was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told a couple of really good,
he tells long stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says jokes are long.
[SPEAKER_02]: His bits are long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you sucked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden there's just this
funny, this wave of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you're so invested in a story,
these guys can tell you seven or eight
[SPEAKER_02]: punchlines just after telling you a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was laughing so hard my face hurt a
little bit from Brant Tobler's jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, Brant Tobler finished up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably did a good 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first guy did 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brant Tobler probably did 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my buddy, Mr. Steve Simone,
the host of the Good Times with Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Simone podcast came out and did,
it was a long show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how long he did, but he just
sits on this little, there's a bar stool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sits on the bar stool and he just got
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like I was just hanging out with
Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was right in my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was right in front of me, just telling
jokes to me in the front row right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned earlier that I tweeted
about Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you know Steve Simone, Steve Simone
can do a lot of material on Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can make you laugh for three hours
about Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've heard a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The material I've heard about Chinese food
was always about him being an adult and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most popular bit is, and I'm not going
to ruin his bit, but I'll give you the
[SPEAKER_02]: premise, that when Chinese food,
you order Chinese food and it's mysterious
[SPEAKER_02]: because you don't know what the shit on
the menu is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these words?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all mystical and you order it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not doing his jokes justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it to be dumb so that if you
do hear his, you can still laugh at his
[SPEAKER_02]: jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he talks about when the food
arrives, all these containers show up and
[SPEAKER_02]: all these adults are arguing over who's
his wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nobody even knows what they
ordered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at your friends and
you're like, damn, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone ends up trading a scoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all about being an adult and how
amazing Chinese food is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it sounds crazy that the guy
can tell three hours of jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw him do 45 minutes on Chinese food
the last time I saw him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he talks about Chinese food for a long
time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Simone did his act this time at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably went for 30, 45 minutes and
then he sat on a stool and he pushed his
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeves on his sweater up and he looked me
in the face and he goes, you guys want to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear about the first time I ate Chinese
food?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not exactly what he said,
but that's basically how he did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked me straight in the face and
he was like, well, here's the first time I
[SPEAKER_02]: had Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he proceeded to tell the story of how
he discovered Chinese food and going to
[SPEAKER_02]: the restaurant to get Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the parts that caught me was he
walked into the restaurant and he goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked in and there's a giant mother
effing dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I'm home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it's not exactly how he
tells the bit because I'm not Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Simone, but it's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to, he did, I feel like he kind
of did that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looked me directly in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was like, you want to hear about my
first time eating Chinese food?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I tweeted him that and he totally
knew that I was coming to see the Chinese
[SPEAKER_02]: food joke and the always lovely,
always beautiful Miss Jenny Beth grabbed
[SPEAKER_02]: my leg and gave me a little squeeze like,
Hey baby, this part's for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so cool that we had that little
connection with Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Steve did the show and it was
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show ended and everybody applauded and
I'm up in the front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, that's the last seat to get
out of the venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when the show ends, you're stuck
because there's all these people that were
[SPEAKER_02]: behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're actually the front of the
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're escaping the show first,
but I was in no hurry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I knew, I know Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know him very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to the backstage to go like catch
his breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably went and got a bottle of water,
took a break, calm down for just a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he walked right out from
backstage up to me and he had a tray of
[SPEAKER_02]: food in his hand and he goes, Hey buddy,
I've got a bunch of food if you guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, there's cheese pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he already knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, there's cheese pizza,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd solved all the problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like pizza, pizza is a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got pizza for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, well shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, stay right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Steve Simone went and wandered around
comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to go talk to a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was schmoozing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I didn't see him for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I walked down this one little
corridor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny and I walked down the corridor and
he goes, Hey, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was just in this little back area
by himself setting up plates of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, come on buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went back there and he's like,
man, all this food's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to eat, dig in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people had brought Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was pasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was mole.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was tortillas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were burrito fixings.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were little Tupperware dishes full
of stuff that I didn't even bother to open
[SPEAKER_02]: because there was so much stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't need to find more food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve was just grubbing and munching down
and Brant Tobler came back and Brant
[SPEAKER_02]: Tobler, Steve Simone, Jenny, Beth and
myself basically ate dinner together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it sounds like I might be telling a
story, but we all sat around and we ate
[SPEAKER_02]: dinner and bullshitted about life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Simone does not use any profanity on
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve doesn't cuss at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a pretty good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to be able to have, he says
grownups.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's 40 years old and he still calls
adults grownups because he's a little kid
[SPEAKER_02]: at heart, which is what I love about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's so honest and so genuine and just
so grateful for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of forgot what the fuck I was
going to say now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grownups, he doesn't cuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to have a show for grownups and
that you could bring little kids to.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says he wants your grandma to bring
your grandson to the show and have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of his theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was doing something and he said
fuck in normal conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got food on his shirt and he said fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jenny and I looked at each other and
we got quiet and Steve goes, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, we just heard the principal say
fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, no, man, I curse off stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just really funny because one time
he did say mother fudging, like he was on
[SPEAKER_02]: stage and I thought that was pretty funny
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I owe a huge shout out to my
friend Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baker, if you're listening to this
podcast, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you every day Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I don't see you frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Jenny and I talk about you were like
that Baker kid is a good boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much love Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who you are, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're hearing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also huge, huge shout out to the best
comedy club on the planet or at least the
[SPEAKER_02]: best comedy club in Colorado and this part
of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only place that could even rival the
place is the comedy store in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But huge shout out to my friends at
ComedyWorks in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Wendy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all of the hosts and
hostesses and managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the ticket people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to everybody at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got mad love for everybody there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show me mad love every time I go
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a rock star, but for some reason
everybody at ComedyWorks treats me like
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fucking rock star.
[SPEAKER_02]: They roll out the red carpet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take really good care of me and I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have left out the wait staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge big ups to the wait staff because
they always keep my drinks coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what I want to drink already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can't give a big enough shout
out and a big enough thank you to Brant
[SPEAKER_02]: Tobler and of course, Mr. Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm grateful for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Steve's podcast, he does a gratitude
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm grateful to have spent a few moments
with one of my favorite comedians who
[SPEAKER_02]: changed my attitude, who gave me a little
different outlook on life, at least maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: for a few days, but it did stick in the
back of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course to Jenny Beth for being a
beautiful, amazing, great date.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a fun time with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for making everything perfect that
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super great dab session in the car before
and after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I'm sure you don't
want to hear too much about the dab
[SPEAKER_02]: session with my girlfriend in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk more about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do something that may make me
sound like a little bit of an asshole,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it will make you a better cannabis
advocate or a cannabis spokesperson in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear a lot of people say the wrong
terminology when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel like I'm responsible for
teaching you the correct terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sort of a historian of sorts,
I guess, when I'm podcasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an archivist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're marking history, and the people that
are involved in cannabis right now are
[SPEAKER_02]: pioneers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are starting an industry that is very
new, and there are a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are coming in that are new, that are
saying, that are just simply making word
[SPEAKER_02]: mistakes, one-letter mistakes,
and I want to correct you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not coming to be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to sound like a better,
smarter grower, smarter advocate,
[SPEAKER_02]: because people already think we're lazy
potheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think we're stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think we're not paying attention,
so I think it's a little important that we
[SPEAKER_02]: take the extra effort to speak correctly,
to spell correctly, to have good grammar.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to put your shit out there
in public, make it presentable so that
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't think you're a lazy stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all of that being said, I've kind of
created a glossary and some things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to go over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a short list, and I'm not trying
to be an asshole about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like I'm being a stuck-up jerk,
but I really want you to sound smarter,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel embarrassed for good growers
when they say the wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, ah, because one thing can ruin
all of your credibility, especially being
[SPEAKER_02]: a pothead.
[SPEAKER_02]: People already don't take you seriously,
so if you go bruh too many times,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't respect you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've lost credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say trichromes instead of
trichomes, you're going to fuck up your
[SPEAKER_02]: credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first thing we're going to
start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word is trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those crystals that grow on your plants,
those little mushroom-looking things,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't call them crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're resin glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say resin glands, but they're
trichome, T-R-I-C-H-O-M-E, trichome,
[SPEAKER_02]: not trichrome, not trichome, not
trichromes, but just a trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's our first glossary word
of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how easy it's going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few people right now that just
went, ah, shit, I've been saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word is trichome, try to comb your
hair, trichome, but don't put the B in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no B.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that was easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was easy enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel so bad now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one, you guys, this bugs the shit
out of me for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quit saying CBDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not plural.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is not pluralized.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say, I want a weed with a lot of
CBDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want cannabis with CBD, high-end CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever ask for a glass of waters?
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter how much water is in your glass,
it's still just water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not plural waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you gathered water from two
sources and mixed them, you might have
[SPEAKER_02]: waters, but as far as I'm concerned,
this bottle of water right here is water,
[SPEAKER_02]: not waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like a water or some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's stop pluralizing CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sounds wonky to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different terpenoids,
but there is only one CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's my story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, this one's directed at somebody
specifically, and I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must correct you because every time I
hear you say it, I go, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day, every time I hear your voice,
I'm proud that you're doing what you do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it bugs the shit out of me when people
call a slab of shatter or some hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: they call it dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to buy some dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, please don't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dab is the thing that is on the tip of
your dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dab is the part you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't buy dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may buy a dab if somebody's got a dab
and they're going to put a dab on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may buy a dab, but you don't buy dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, you don't, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who I'm talking to and you're
going, fuck you Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know you are, but I still love
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just, I'm not going to call you
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just quit, quit saying dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got some concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to buy some dabs maybe,
but it just bugs me when you say I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel like an asshole for my
corrections, but some people are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: sound like better people just for me
helping you out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel like it's my duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to, to recap that without feeling like
a jerk, I am going to buy some concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: or I am going to buy some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy a slab and then I will
take a dab of my shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have got some dabs on my shirt because I
dropped some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a dab stuck to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff works, but I don't have dabs
stuck to my shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not mad at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to sound better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I offended you, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me hate mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read it and I'll reply, but I
apologize in advance if that sounded rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt kind of rude doing it, but
honestly, I just want you to sound better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want everybody to be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to lift you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just looked up at the clock and it is
seven Oh nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means we got to start heating the
nail because it's seven 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take us a big old fat dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slowly heat the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put some tain in the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough butane in the torch to
make a fire because this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: professional podcasting right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're filling a torch with butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just using cheap butane on my elevate
torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're still going to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be on time for seven 10.
Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heating it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still using the, the thermal banger on
the hitman hammerhead rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got the bubble cap right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually using a custom of red,
yellow and green pencil from tater glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a gift from the always lovely,
always beautiful Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: This nail is just about hot enough and
it's got to cool down for just a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now seven 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a seven 10 dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are dabbing with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me an email or a tweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy seven 10 everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cap it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I have got a nice fat dab in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's work our way into some emails now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a big stack of emails right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to go through and randomly
pull out an email out of this stack and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even doing any sort of selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to pull out this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, let me get right in front of
my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making sure they want me to or not
want me to say their name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't give me indications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to say your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to send me an email,
let's grow from your heart at a hotmail
[SPEAKER_02]: .com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to answer your questions on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you have talked about breeding on the
podcast, but what about just making seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: of your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have slowly collected a lot of genetics
and I'm having to keep cutting clones just
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to be able to make seeds and then
put them away while I experiment with new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, I just bought a five pack of
jelly bean and have two females and one
[SPEAKER_02]: male right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I pollinate just one section of one
of the females to make some seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: later?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the best cannabis podcast out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he signs his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you are welcome for the best
cannabis podcast out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I'm the best,
but since you say so, that means it's
[SPEAKER_02]: real, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, huge shout out to all the other
cannabis podcasts out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listen to a lot of them and I do
appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to hear that you think I'm the best
means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the heart of this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you're working with Jelly
Bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly Bean is so much fun to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you have got two females and one
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope, I hope that you have got a candy
store fino and an orange fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are good chances of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pop five seeds and you've got that
many, if you've got three around,
[SPEAKER_02]: one's a boy and you got two girls,
oh, you would be so lucky to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: candy store and the orange fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: The candy store one kind of, it smells
like the candy store in the mall is the
[SPEAKER_02]: best way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how some of the candy,
when you bite into it, it's got that real
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet, but you could taste it's still
powdery and it smells like jelly beans or
[SPEAKER_02]: jelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said jelly beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like jelly beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the candy store fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: The orange fino smells like a glass of
orange juice, just straight up orange
[SPEAKER_02]: juice with maybe like another hint of like
lemon or pineapple or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are the two finos that are well
known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've got one of those,
you're a lucky dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got each of those, you're super
lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to get too picky on male
selection because you've only got one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we do know that it's a jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, there is nothing stopping you from
putting that male plant in with those two
[SPEAKER_02]: females and letting him put pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said, for example, I just bought a
five pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I pollinate just one section of the
females?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but that's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not getting pollen on the other parts of
the plant will be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would do is just put, I would put
the male in the room about 14 days ahead
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I would put the girl in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would honestly, if you could keep them
separate, that's best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flower the male about 14 days ahead,
put the girls in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the girls about 21 days into flower,
that means that the boys are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: about 35 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, carry the boy into there
and shake it all over the girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now those girls are totally pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you can do, you can keep that
boy separate, flower him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around day 14, you'll see them start
dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around day 20 to 25 to 30, he'll really be
dumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in there with a jar or some sort of
receptacle and gather that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then put it into a container.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get, before you put it into a
container, you need to get all of the male
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male flowers hold moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moisture destroys pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get all of the moisture out of
this pollen if you want it to be viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to store it and keep it,
you need to get all of the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Tony, Mr. Toad, taught us a
long time ago about using silicate packets
[SPEAKER_02]: to take the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some silicate packets in your container
are always a good idea to get the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: out of your pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use a screen on top of a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the screen over the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people use a panty hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stretch it real tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just rub with a credit card,
rub the pollen through the screen and the
[SPEAKER_02]: male flowers gather up on the top and you
just scrape those right off and discard
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get all the male flowers out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can just shake that pollen into
something like a magazine or a bowl and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can use a paintbrush and go in the
other room and just paint a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: branches with that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to control pollen because
if you sneeze, you just fucked everything
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's flying around the whole room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be really careful with the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to get it from the plant to
the female and apply it carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it with a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it with a paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just do it open pollination style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I let the male do his magic to the girls,
just exactly how it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give them a good shake.
[SPEAKER_02]: The girls receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole plant is seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know maybe you don't want to pollinate
your whole crop, the whole room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's an easy way to make plenty of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, here's something that I just
recently did.
[SPEAKER_02]: This works.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran my normal breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put some Capelten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made more seeds of the firefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made more morning dew seeds,
but I also wanted to make some new crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: and I wanted to make some stuff that was
just for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to make platinum tangy to a rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to make canadential to a rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a canadential and a platinum tangy
and there were a couple others.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those red solo cups that you get at a
party for the keg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put enough soil in there to fill that
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a little plant, a little clone in
there and I let it grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably six or eight inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I put it into the breeding chamber to
flower with all the other big girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got pollen on it just like I did all the
big girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants were maybe a foot tall,
maybe 10 to 12 inches tall out of the pot
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time they were finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took one bamboo stick and put it in
there and they stayed up real light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to lean them up against shit to keep
them upright because they got top heavy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they stayed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made it all the way through the
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I harvested them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got between 30 and 50 seeds from each
plant that was in a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need enough light to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 400 watt light doesn't do it for me
when I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like the seeds are robust
enough and you don't get enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: A 600 did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A thousand watt light is really what I
like for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you need that power of that
much light to get yourself enough seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put just one light worth of small plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just veg them for a little while to where
they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put one light in there of girls and one
male in there and just let them go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will make plenty of seeds for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, if you just want to pollinate
one section, gather that pollen into a
[SPEAKER_02]: container, get a paint brush, dip it into
the pollen just like you're going to do if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to paint, and then paint that
right onto the pollen, right onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, right onto the thickest,
most robust pistol-lit hairs you can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you want to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want those thick, robust hairs that
are just ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the pistols, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something we should probably have
gone over in the glossary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quit saying hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those aren't hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are pistol-lit hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are known as pistols.
[SPEAKER_02]: What their job is is to collect the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They collect the pollen and they slide the
pollen right down that and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to talk about what happens
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you can tell that the plant has
been pollinated because those pistol-lit
[SPEAKER_02]: hairs will turn brown and start crinkling
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the next few days, they'll start
crinkling up and turn it in and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: all be brown and crunchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good indicator that that section
of the plant has been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to pollinate one small section
of the plant, if you're going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen into a room and you only want one
plant receiving pollen, you can spray
[SPEAKER_02]: water on the rest of the garden and
hopefully those plants will not be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm so stressful about getting
all the male flowers and using a silicate
[SPEAKER_02]: pack in your pollen storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray the rest of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your male pollen in there and
paintbrush what you need to and then spray
[SPEAKER_02]: the rest of the plant down also if you
feel like that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then spray yourself down to deactivate all
the pollen because you don't want to take
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollen back into the grow later or to
somebody else's grow or anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simple answer is yes, you can make a
bunch of seeds for your self so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to keep clones around.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using the male and the female of
the same strain, you may be making F2 or
[SPEAKER_02]: F3 or maybe even F4 or F5 of the strain
that you have purchased.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on what a finial
generation the breeder you purchased it
[SPEAKER_02]: from has taken it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know DJ Short likes to breed things all
the way up to like F4 or F5 before he
[SPEAKER_02]: releases them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't leave a lot of variation for
you breeding it to the F6 or F7 or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it's going to, which is going to
actually be a good thing for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some breeders like Gage Green,
and I'm not calling anybody out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just how they work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying Gage sucks or anything,
but Gage Green is known for releasing F1
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids or polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you breed those, he's giving you
F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a male and a female of the
same seed stock and you cross them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are now making an F2 finial
generation, kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on how the first ones were
bred, but for our example here,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're F2ing your varietal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you make that F2, a lot of times
the F2s are better than the F1s,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're going to see variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see something that looks
like grandma, something that looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: grandpa, and they'll be on both sides of
the trait chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can I explain this a little better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you've got a strain like,
I'm just going to invent something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you've got White Widow crossed to
Grateful Dog, which is actually Capelton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the other side, you've got
Arise, or we'll say Golden Goat crossed to
[SPEAKER_02]: Daybreaker, which is Arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cross the Arise and the Capelton,
you will see traits of all four of the
[SPEAKER_02]: grandparents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see White Widow, Grateful Dog,
Golden Goat, and Daybreaker
[SPEAKER_02]: representations in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes that's a good thing because
some of those plants will outperform the
[SPEAKER_02]: original parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have created more robust,
faster growing, more resinous,
[SPEAKER_02]: more desirable plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find better progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the term for that is
transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody wants to Google and tell me if
I'm right or wrong, I think the term
[SPEAKER_02]: transgressive segregation is going to have
something about better performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to say performing or
extreme or turbo or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to say turbo, but it's
going to be something like that that
[SPEAKER_02]: indicates transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just indicating that it
outperforms its parents is what I mean by
[SPEAKER_02]: the transgressive segregation term here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, you'll be making the next
finial generation, which is always fun
[SPEAKER_02]: too, because you'll either be stabilizing
it or you'll find one that's way different
[SPEAKER_02]: that you like better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have a lot of fun with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll have different phenotypes
of seeds that you created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this whole problem of having to keep a
whole bunch of strains around is only
[SPEAKER_02]: going to compound itself once you start
making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you get into plant hoarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you end up buying a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you end up just going big and
ending up as a breeder and having tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, here's something that we should talk
about timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timing is crucial when you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make seeds, if you want to
make a lot of seeds, if you want to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it worth your time, timing is very
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea to have the male a little
bit ahead of the females.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got the male and the female,
if you start them flowering at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: exact time next to each other,
you'll get plenty of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a lot of seeds, I suggest you
let the male flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a fly flying in my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggest you let the male flower start
him off 10 to 14 days early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep him away from the girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then put the girls into flower 10 to 14
days after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will see the male starting to dump
pollen around day 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen will start coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen will really start coming out around
day 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around day 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your girl plants are going to want pollen
around day, kind of depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, but around day 23 through 32-ish,
maybe 25 through 32-ish, depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've noticed, if I'm breeding
for firefly, I need to put the lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: plant into the flowering room much earlier
because it needs to develop those tall
[SPEAKER_02]: buds and start getting a lot of pistols on
those tall buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I pollinate it too soon, it quits
growing and I don't give it enough bud
[SPEAKER_02]: sites to actually receive enough pollen to
make it worth the shit to breed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put the lemon skunk plant in there a
little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then about four or five days later,
I'll put Capleton in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a few days later, I will put
whatever, Kalanji Kush in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will pollinate them all at the
same time because they will all have
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten to the right ovulation point is
basically what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So timing is very crucial when you're
trying to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, if you just want to make a
few seeds for yourself, put them in there
[SPEAKER_02]: on the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it all happen naturally or set that
male plant in another room, collect the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just set it on a ceramic plate or
on a mirror, or you can just tap it every
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of days and get some pollen out of
it until you've got enough to do what you
[SPEAKER_02]: think you need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not take a lot of pollen to make
plenty of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a lot of seeds with one male
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for a reference point, I'm not sure
how much I should talk about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a plant in a beer cup, I can pull 30
to 50 seeds from if done properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, also I should mention, I forgot to
mention this, I will pollinate twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll hit the plants one time and
then I'll give them three to five days and
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go back and repollinate just to
make sure that I got them sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I forgot to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what was I saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get about 30 to 50 seeds from a
plant in a beer cup in a three gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant that I grow about a foot,
maybe two feet tall before I flower it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ends up about three, three and a half
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually depending on the strain,
you guys, I will get 500 to a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds out of a plant like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making seeds for yourself,
you only have to do that once and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got a thousand seeds to work with
and that should last you a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you're running huge numbers,
which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine how many plants under that,
you can fit nine of those three gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: pots under a light comfortably,
maybe 12 if you cram them in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 16 if you really fucking force them
in, but I don't like to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually do about nine three gallon pots
and then, or maybe nine five gallon pots
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just around the outer edge there,
I do a couple of cups just for
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm making commercial seed,
that's how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a thousand watt light, I got about
nine plants, probably get 500 seeds on
[SPEAKER_02]: average, a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: The redheaded stranger will give me a
thousand seeds because that plant just
[SPEAKER_02]: makes a bunch of heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kalanji Kush on the other hand,
I'll get closer to 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of depends on the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I don't know how much of that I
should be talking about, so don't tell
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I answered your question about
making seeds for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not as hard or scary as it sounds,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: People get really intimidated when it
comes to male plants and breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that, but it's nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardest part is not pollinating stuff
on accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something super important to think
about is don't go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go around any of your friends that
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to anybody's grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you work at a grow, stay the fuck away
from there until you have completely
[SPEAKER_02]: showered, changed your clothes,
gotten totally wet because you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: deactivate all of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be that guy that goes and pollinates
everybody's garden on accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
just over 31 minutes here and I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: taken much of a break or a drink or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did take a dab in the middle of the
show, but I think it's time to start
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapping up the podcast.

[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, the beautiful Dab
and Granny fell down some stairs recently
[SPEAKER_02]: and she hurt her foot really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a busted up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, she fucked her shit up real good
and we need to give her all the love we
[SPEAKER_02]: can send to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you believe in, whatever you
think about, send love and light to Dab
[SPEAKER_02]: and Granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a busted ankle, ankle,
toes, foot region.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her ankle and foot is in a cast and her
toes are sticking out of the cast and it
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like a package of Vienna sausages.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pretty swollen up.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pretty purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to be okay, but she needs some
love, some light.
[SPEAKER_02]: She needs her spirits lifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can only dab so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's all send a huge gigantic shout out
to the Dab and Granny and until next time,
[SPEAKER_02]: take a fat dab and give your mama a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in darkness, world stops turning Ashes
where the body's burning No more war pigs
[SPEAKER_01]: have the power And God has struck the hour
Day of judgment, God is calling
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath the war pigs crawling Begging
mercies for the sins Satan laughing,
[SPEAKER_01]: spreads his wings Oh Lord, yeah!
[SPEAKER_01]: you
