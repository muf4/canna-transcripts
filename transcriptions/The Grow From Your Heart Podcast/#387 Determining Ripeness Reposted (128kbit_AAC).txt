[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 387 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www

[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a tradition that I start the
podcast off by letting you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of Stardog
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows I love the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a great podcast intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along with the
podcast, you know that I've been doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: long series of Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be a repost of an
episode about determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was originally posted as episode
number 319.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode does feature White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original episode was about 45 minutes
long, but I cut out the part about
[SPEAKER_00]: determining ripeness, and that was
approximately 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to be out of town for a couple of
days this week, so I won't be able to put
[SPEAKER_00]: together a quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this episode about determining
ripeness, and I feel like it falls
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly in line with the Grow series
that we have been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's jump right into this old school
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast featuring White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is episode 319,
Determining Ripeness, reposted as episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 387.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to

[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 319 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table is White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking time out of the busy
schedule of two kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dos ninos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dos ninos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell where we're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a show from Pueblo,
Colorado, where the white guys speak real
[SPEAKER_00]: good Spanish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in an Instagram live feed and
somebody tried to throw out some German
[SPEAKER_00]: and I responded in German and the whole
room just went silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire chat stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Mike's on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a show about... What are
we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Determining ripeness and when to harvest
your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, you know I like to
start the episodes by stocking about...
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's talk about what I've been
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of some Viola Labs
Clementine Cookies live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm opening it up to smell it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like spicy orange candy and I really
love the smell and flavor of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up three grams today when I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just get one gram of each
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, do they have more of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take three and I will be on my
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, is it time to change that microphone
cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're subliminally telling
me right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a furry spot, but I've got
Malamute, so I'm used to furry spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to blame that on your
Malamutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Malamute hair, but it's not
hippie hair either, so I'm cool just
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling it off and rolling with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might want to look for a new
cover after this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the furry spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be that kind of show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put this show back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of sponsors we should
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the Hela Dank
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're drinking water now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Mike is drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a rare occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pack properly for this mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some water's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some water anyway, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel bad for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you went and spilled half of it
right down your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's a rare occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hela Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company at Dank Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot store, support our friends at the Hela
Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, support more of my friends,
PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I know you want to know what's going
on in your grow room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're away and you're like,
I wonder if that air conditioner clicked
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that air conditioner's
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even think about what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, ah, is that air conditioner
working?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to drive home and look,
but you can't drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bust out your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your PL minder unit and you can
see what's going on in your grow room at
[SPEAKER_00]: all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get a PL grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get a PL minder unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to PL Grow Dot Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out at PL Grow Dot Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, PL Grow Systems minder unit will
let you know what's going on in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can enjoy what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, all of the YouTube videos are
caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long time, but they are finally
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a multi-year project.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube got evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the scariest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just about caught up and then
all of the YouTube channels started
[SPEAKER_00]: disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put videos of myself consuming on
this channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be your saving grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I talk heavily about it,
but they don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless they're looking for it and
someone reports it, we should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how long it lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, if it does disappear,
I'll find a new place to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is, that's just another place for
more people to listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll probably get more,
more listens, more views, more
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you got anything to say before we
start talking about determining ripeness
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got any topics you want to bring
before we get on a ramble here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just see where it takes us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike says, we'll see where this takes us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people were talking on
Instagram Live and on chat rooms right now
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to decide when to harvest their
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is my cannabis ripe?
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed packs are going to tell you a
certain timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say 56 to 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say 63 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you run that pack of seeds,
I would say go the longest timeframe that
[SPEAKER_00]: they give you as an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least plan for it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says nine to 10 weeks, go the 10
weeks, because maybe in that last week,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you're going to see extra
trichomes pack on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see the extra weight come
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see maybe some cool
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some shit you don't see if you
cut it down at week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let it go 10 weeks if it says 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says 56 to 63 days, let it go 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go 65 if it looks okay and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, the way to determine
ripeness of your cannabis plants is not by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not by looking at the shape of the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not by looking at ... I did air
quotes when I said hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing different people throughout my
cannabis career speaking at length about
[SPEAKER_01]: how all of those are telltale signs of
either perfect herb or good herb or
[SPEAKER_01]: completed herb, ready to harvest herb,
and it's all nonsense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are growing cannabis for,
the viable part that we want are the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we look at anything but the
trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to harvest those when they're at
their ripest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should be paying attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you can do that, you can,
if somebody tells you they can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes with their naked eye,
either steal their eyes or kick them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dick because they're a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot see amber trichomes without
some sort of magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need at least 60X, maybe 100X
magnification to see if a trichome is
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, cloudy, silver, milky, amber,
busted, ruptured.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the head's broken off of it,
you need magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot see that with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can, you're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start looking at scopes, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself like a jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a scope from DinoLite that hooks up
to my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plug it right into the USB slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me just a few minutes to mess with
the drivers to make it link up to my
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it linked up, it was no problem ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open up the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to run the scope over the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can focus it in and I can see those
trichomes very large on my computer
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can't tell exactly what I'm
looking at, I can reach over and I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: press F11 and I take a photo right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can go look later and I can see if
that plant's ripe or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The computerized scope makes life a lot
easier, but you can pick up something kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a jeweler's loop that's a lot less
expensive and just as functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 420 scope will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a basic jeweler's loop will work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that Hydrofarm sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got batteries in it and then it
splits in half and the batteries are in
[SPEAKER_00]: one side and the optics are actually in
the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a 60 and a 100X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend the 100X if you go for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best one on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get something like that
that I'm aware of, there's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: something better by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get to magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnification will help you out in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell if your trichomes
are clear, if they're silver, if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy, if they're milky, if they're
amber, if they're ruptured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you'll be able to identify the pests
and the funguses and the problems on the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside of your leaves more accurately
if you've got a scope to look at those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really useful tool throughout the
growth cycle for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got all of your tools dialed
in and you've got some money to spend on a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of extra toys for the grow room,
get yourself a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really help a scope or a loop or
something that hooks up to your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hairs are not going to tell you how
ready your plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike just tapped his head on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you too hot there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just kind of itch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scratch it up, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His leg's starting to go because he's
scratching behind his ear, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little twitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that's going to tell you if
your cannabis plants are ripe are the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing for trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing to make quality flowers,
if you're going to make edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to make extracts,
if you're going to make anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes are what matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the way that you could tell the
trichomes, you're going to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes develop on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a scope and you can pay
attention through the entire process,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch those trichomes go from a little
bitty stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch them develop ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the head of that trichome fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll watch it fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll start to change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go from clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll slowly turn to like a silverish
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll get cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see it, you'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now you're going, what does he mean
by cloudy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you got a fishbowl and then you
put some dish soap in there and stirred it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your cloudy trichomes are
going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your next step after cloudy is milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they turn kind of bluish in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a hint of blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you stare at like certain white paints
and whatnot, you'll start to see a blue
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of undertone a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a nice patch of milky trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always see just a little hint of light
blue in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fishbowl I talked about a minute
ago, imagine if I took your fishbowl that
[SPEAKER_00]: had, we dumped out the dish soap because
this is just going to get gross if we keep
[SPEAKER_00]: adding stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you took a fishbowl that's got
water in it and you poured just enough
[SPEAKER_00]: milk in there to make it turn light white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be fucking boom like ice
cream, but it's going to be light white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you poured some creamer in your
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just lightened it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that trichome is what I would call
milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a milky trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're almost ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step that's going to happen is
going to look like you had a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I took like the little spray
bottle that you're spraying your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with or whatever that little mister
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I poured some Dr. Pepper in there
and I walked right up to your trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: and just just give it a little spritz of
Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your trichomes are going to have a little
amber spritz on them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what I think it looks
like is like you sprayed some soda right
[SPEAKER_00]: onto your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go from milky and then
you're going to see just a couple of them
[SPEAKER_00]: get this amber color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Dr. Pepper color right across them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see it happen toward
the top and kind of right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep pay attention to the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you see that first bit of amber
really start paying attention because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a very short time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start that amber is going
to start progressing throughout the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the scope and you can
see you're going to have to look around
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant when 30 percent of those
trichomes start becoming amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you want to cut down 30
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say look in several places you're
going to be like 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know when I can see a hundred
trichomes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look around and use your best
judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys about 25 to 35 percent is where
you want to aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to notice a difference if
you're a few days off on your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly you are not going to notice a
huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a drying cure period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you cut down these plants those
trichomes are going to continue to change
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way until the moment you combust
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got this dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get beat up and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be so many different
changes in those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple of days in your harvest
window will not make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to hurt your feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to turn silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to get cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it starts getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're filling up with trichomes or with
cannabinoids now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got different things in their
different psychoactive ingredients inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of there that are changing every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to get milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn a little bit blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to look like I sprayed
them with Dr. Pepper when three out of 10
[SPEAKER_00]: when 30 percent of them have that Dr.
Pepper stain on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's time to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to say, but it's my first
grow with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I plan that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I properly be able to flush and
look out for trichomes to be amber?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought of a great way that we can all
be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to be the last time
you're growing the strain, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time you grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't know when the
trichomes are going to change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't know how long it's
going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time you're developing a
relationship with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you got to learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, third time you dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth and fifth time you perfect this
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just learning this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a 60 day plant,
if the package says grow it for 55 to 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days, go that 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go for 60 days,
flush it day 50 and really start paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to cut it down at a specific
day, just make sure you flushed seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to go 14, but seven to 10 days
should be plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to let your plant go 70 days,
if you've got something I bred,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably want to let it go 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I bred it 70 days, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start flushing at day 60 and pay attention
to your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut down at day 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't feel like it's ready,
let it go a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need nutrients to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to start getting tired,
but then you can give it time to ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the way to judge when to
harvest your cannabis is by paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a way to look at the
trichomes, you don't have a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately judge the ripeness of your
cannabis plants and you run the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting them way too early is what most
people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they're done,
wait three to five more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can wait seven more days,
wait because they're only going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't cut too early because you're
anxious and eager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut clones or you grew from seeds and
those took time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you vegged it out and you spent a lot
of money on nutrients you've already
[SPEAKER_00]: spent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to put 115 days into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not put 122?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another week?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you start getting itchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting that crack head lips and
you start scratching your neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, I want to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of a friend of mine who was
always in that clipping lower nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd start at the bottom of the plant and
start taking nugs and drying them out as
[SPEAKER_01]: fast as he could to keep himself covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time he got to harvest,
it was just like the top coal is left on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's nothing to enjoy because
you fast ride everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could have just had one huge
harvest and actually saw a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see what it looks like,
what your work actually did instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just destroying your work slowly and not
getting any reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the main things that it's
hard to learn when you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just need to hide your
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send Mike home with the scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, bro, take these so that I can't
cut my plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on suicide watch or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take these, bro, so I can't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that was a pretty quick way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's right to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other way to explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some sort of magnification and look at
your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing for trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't care about all that leafy green
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the secret, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to get in there with some
magnification and spend some time reading
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not worried about all the green
leafy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that part tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the trichomes are the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure they're ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I should add.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing for concentrates,
maybe cut a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start flushing early and harvest a little
bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you want nice and clear
concentrates, maybe this is some industry
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets I shouldn't be sharing with the
general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want nice and clear concentrates,
cut your plants down before the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start getting dark, what you're
extracting is trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your concentrates will come out a little
bit darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them down when they're nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and clear concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of concentrate makers can make super
clear concentrates out of everything now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less work if you're pulling it down
when you have got nice and clear
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut early and process quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to tell you what week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes like week seven-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it go for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can pull a whole one more
harvest a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut everything down at the end of
week six, then you could feel one more
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest a year in your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's business, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Axel Rose said, all we need is just a
little patience.
