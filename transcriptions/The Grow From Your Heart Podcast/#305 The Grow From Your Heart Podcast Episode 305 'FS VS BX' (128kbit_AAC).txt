[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 305 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another Thursday
quickie episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these episodes off by
letting you know what I've been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I'm going to tell you what I wish
I was smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Sunday, I stopped at a dispensary in
Colorado Springs called A Cut Above.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had about 75 ish concentrates on the
shelf to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had some of the best flowers
I've seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I was there for was concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably 75 quality
concentrates to look through before I made
[SPEAKER_00]: my decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about halfway through and I stumbled
across something called Star Child OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode called Follow Your
Nose, talking about whatever jumps out at
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose is probably going to probably
going to be good medicine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smelled this Star Child OG and something
in my brain, my nose and my body said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, just buy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to look any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said to grandma that aside, of course,
I'm stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked further and I found some of this
super sour lemon, live resin from Olio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells and tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this Star Child, it had this Durban
poison Jack Herrera Super Lemon Haze kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a flavor going on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had an aroma and it was saucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was high cannabinoid full spectrum
extract crystals floating around in high
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid full or high terpene full
spectrum extract terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was crystals and sauce just floating
around in a tiny jar together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the aroma just kept punching me in the
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it disappeared very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked that gram Sunday with Kev.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin and I destroyed that gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enjoyed it, but it disappeared very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vision and I had more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came home today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to take some dabs after work
and I picked up my dab rig and it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little mucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, maybe I should rinse that
thing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took it to the sink and ran some hot
water through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that hot water hit my rig,
I could smell that dryer sheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenaline Jack Herrera Durban poison
smell throughout the entire kitchen area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was overwhelmingly perfectly amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like some sort of aroma therapy
candle had been lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somebody had some potpourri or
somebody sprayed one of those little
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my mouth drool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me wish I had more of those dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Starchild OG, that's what I wish I
was dabbing on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me it was actually snow
lotus from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it was, shout it to a cut above.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was some delicious extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color, the consistency, the flavor,
the aroma, beautiful concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I bought the very last gram
that they had when I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless they've got more next time,
that was my last shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Starchild OG was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish I had more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kitchen smells like it right now,
even though I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a nice clean rig and I've been
dabbing since I cleaned the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of the pre-98 Bubba
Kush Ambrosia batter from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got sort of a, and I know I say
this a lot, earthy, coffee, cushy sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a smell to it, plus a hint of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's earthy, cushy, coffee,
chocolate, maybe with a little like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet thing in there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-98 Bubba Kush, I'm smelling it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I described it accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth, coffee, chocolate, and cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm dabbing the pre-98 Bubba Kush
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting decent sized dabs of the
batter and putting it on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm getting some bobblehead high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals
[SPEAKER_00]: and dunking that batter into the crystals
to pick it up like salt and pepper on my
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a little bobblehead crystals on
the dab and the bobblehead is pre-98 Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and headband ran together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are pretty nice dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of flavor from the batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bobblehead concentrate is 98% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting a lot of THC in my brain
when I take a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a lot of cannabinoids,
a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the batter gives me this nice lung
punch that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super great dabs today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I cleaned the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, Saturday night,
I got to go see Chris Hardwick at
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And holy shit, what a fun show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: April Richardson, the host and producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not the host, the producer of The
Nerdist, now known as The Identity
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember how to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerdist changed the name of all their
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, Chris Hardwick changed the
name of his podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, April Richardson opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: She makes fun of herself a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a very unique looking woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she uses that to her advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Jenny Beth was my date for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedian April Richardson was from
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny Beth is from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we were sitting up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the comedian, comedian,
I think that's what you call lady
[SPEAKER_00]: comedian, when she said she was from
Georgia, Jenny screamed like woohoo,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're both from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they made friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cool to have her kind of
come perform right in front of Jenny for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Miss April Richardson brought out a
guy by the name of Mike Furman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew Mike Furman would be there
because I saw a guitar on stage when we
[SPEAKER_00]: walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a huge hint that Mike Furman
would be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Furman is one of Chris Hardwick's
best friends from a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be in a group called Hard and
Firm together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Hardwick, Mike Furman.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a group called Hard and Firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they would sing really good shitty
songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I said really good shitty songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musical comedy is always terrible unless
you're in the mood for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it's Hard and Firm or maybe Wheeler
Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually it's not good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But these guys pull it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheesy white guys and they nail
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Furman comes out and does quite a bit
of good material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ruin any of it because it
was all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're coming toward your area,
go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I drove two hours to go see this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no excuse to not go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike Furman does a nice set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he of course brings out the legend,
Chris Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Hardwick comes out and did,
I don't know, he must have done a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hour and 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he killed the entire hour and 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he asked the people on stage on that
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of crowd work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He interacts with the audience quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he asked the people over there,
he's like, hey, what do you do for work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one guy's like, I'm a geologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made rock jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked the next person, what do you
do for work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person sitting next to that person
said, we're all three geologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three people in that row are
geologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Hardwick is like, damn it,
Denver, you're allowed to hang out with
[SPEAKER_00]: other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he walks to the other side of the
stage and he's going to interview people
[SPEAKER_00]: over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, sir, what do you do for
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy's like, I'm a project manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure you're not a geologist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he asks that man's date,
what do you do for work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she laughs really hard and turns red
and says, I'm a project manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on one side of the stage, we've got
geologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side of the stage,
project managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hardwick is saying to himself,
damn it, or not to himself, out loud,
[SPEAKER_00]: damn it, Denver, date other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to stay in your box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he looks at me and he smiles and he
says, you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sticks the mic in my face and he
says, what do you do for work,
[SPEAKER_00]: sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I proudly said, I am in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said it just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I didn't embarrass the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't embarrass myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say I grow weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody knows that when they
look at me, I got dreadlocks, red eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: a crooked grassroots hats and a veg
balloon tee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to say it professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I am in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, yeah, no shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably tell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a couple of jokes and he walked
around the stage and goes on about it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he makes a joke about how the
geologists, the project managers and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself should get together and start a
business, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we got the guy that breaks up the
rocks and the guy that grows the dope and
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy that does the project managing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hardwick made some jokes on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he came back to Miss Jenny Beth
because she was sitting next to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, ma'am, what do you do for work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Jenny Beth told the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, I am in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crowd and Hardwick went fucking
wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was pretty damn funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made fun of us for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he walked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we were on a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the girl on a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at her and I gave her a little
kiss after Hardwick made fun of us because
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, Jenny Beth has a huge crush on
Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I'm supposed to say
that on the podcast, but hey, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny has had a crush on Hardwick since
she was a kid, she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave her a kiss because I took her to
that show and I was like, look what I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, babe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardwick interacted with you, fun date,
we win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave her a kiss, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hardwick goes, oh, they kissed,
how sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, aw, how sweet Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm front row at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes, oh my God, there was
probably some marijuana lipstick or
[SPEAKER_00]: something involved, wasn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got real serious and he came
and stood right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, hey, somebody told me there's
marijuana suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did the little finger motion like,
you know, like suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and Jenny Beth were like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh my God, they know about it
and they're proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, have you tried these?
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and Jenny, of course, because we're
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jenny did the finger motion back
to him, like if you were going to just
[SPEAKER_00]: insert one in someone's bum, boink,
she did that motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hardwick just laughed and put his hand
on his face and did the shaking my damn
[SPEAKER_00]: head laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did that emoji.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just fucking, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to see Chris Hardwick,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am fucking humble bragging because
it was a great fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hardwick did his set.
[SPEAKER_00]: He interacted with the audience quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes into the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sits on the audience's lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He interacted with a kid named Ian a lot,
embarrassed the shit out of this kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kid was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have pissed himself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the opportunity to go see Chris
Hardwick, go do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hardwick does his set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he's like, would you guys mind if I
bring out Mike Furman again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's his best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Furman came out and they did another
20 or 30 minutes together of crowd work
[SPEAKER_00]: and like improv comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, I'm not going to ruin
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you what it was
about or what they said or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they sang a song together that was
very, very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a video in the background that
matched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their theatrics were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to break something
laughing so hard and it was fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys go see Chris Hardwick,
go to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to ComedyWorks, tell him Rasta
Jeff sent you and have a good ass time and
[SPEAKER_00]: be a good, be a good comedy guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't heckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Chris Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I had to brag on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come see a comedy show with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly, let's talk about something
that somebody asked me on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do Instagram live videos where I will
answer cannabis grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer all kinds of weird questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about all kinds of random shit on
my Instagram live videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm irey underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody asked me, it was actually
Bagsy Jesse asked me to explain the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between F2 and BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I thought of a really easy way to
explain this F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you take, let's just pick a
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a handful of a rise seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make an arise male and you make an
arise female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's back up a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to correct myself and back up a
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're certain that these seeds
are F1s, that your arise seeds are F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only way that this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for my example, these arise seeds
are F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got seeds that you know are F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got an arise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crossed Daybreaker to Golden Goat,
Daybreaker and Golden Goat, I crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some of those from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you found a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a male F1 and a female F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross those, you make F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross from the same handful of
seeds, if you cross the male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same batch, batch, filial
generation, you are now making F2s,
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a handful of F2s and you
cross those together, a male and a female,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making F3 and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have to come from, so the male,
female, F1 pollinate each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make this handful of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take these handful of seeds,
you find males and females, you breed them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, you make F3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds that come up, you breed them
together, you make F4s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so a BX would be if I took the arise
F1 seeds that I have and bred them back to
[SPEAKER_00]: either the Golden Goat or the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the most disgusting terms to say it,
F2s are brother and sister funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: F3s are brother and sister fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing filial generations are brother
and sister fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: BXing is parent fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking disgusting to think about
it that way, but now the idea is clear in
[SPEAKER_00]: your head and there's no confusion on what
the difference between an F or a BX is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanna make filial generations
forward, you just keep using batches of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same seed that come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your male and female,
you breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this little thing where you make
more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the male and female together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason to do that is to stabilize
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: With arise, I would like to get them all
into that one phenotype that is real
[SPEAKER_00]: squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows that one squatty bushy phenotype
with a giant cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of resin on it and it kinda
smells like gassy ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's a really weird
description, but it's like, it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothness to it and a gas to it at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna find, and I've done a couple
generations, I just don't release a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep some things to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta find the F1 that looks like what
you want it to be and find another male
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like what you want it to be and
breed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll make the F2s and then find
the F2 that grows like you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then find the male that looks like you
want it to be and breed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time you go, you should get
it closer and closer to making clones
[SPEAKER_00]: basically when you grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get to F4 or F5,
you're gonna be growing basically clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll throw out 10 seeds and they're all
gonna look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar, almost clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you would wanna move forward
with a filial generation with brother and
[SPEAKER_00]: sister fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why would you wanna do a BX?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a really good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is a clone only strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no male of Golden Goat in
existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that made that put out the best
Golden Goat and got rid of the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't know what he did,
but that's never been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's got access to a male Golden Goat
other than the guy that made Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: whose name is Mr. Dink.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to think I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not my creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy named Mr. Dink did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no male Golden Goat,
but perhaps a lot of people would like
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they would because they ask me for
it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way to get some Golden
Goat seeds without fucking up Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to take a Golden Goat
female and pollinate it with a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now perhaps I did that with Daybreaker
and I made a rise, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a Golden Goat today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker, which it wouldn't have been
the best idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intention here wasn't to make a BX,
but this is just a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat to Daybreaker made a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I wanted to get Golden Goat closer
to Golden Goat seeds, I would take a male,
[SPEAKER_00]: a rise that looked a lot like Golden Goat
that had those long, skinny, shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would put that pollen on the
female Golden Goat and now I've just back
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'd wanna do that is now
I'm going to make seeds that have two,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's Golden Goat right here that I
just pollinated plus there's Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: and Daybreaker and this other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's two chances of getting,
two out of three chances of getting Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat style dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna see a lot of Golden Goat traits
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 66% hypothetically, hopefully if I do it
right, hopefully, about 66%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I would grow those and out of that
batch of seeds, I would find the best
[SPEAKER_00]: looking male, the one that looked like the
Golden Goat male closest to Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would use that and I would repot and
pollinate that Golden Goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds are gonna be very close to
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you would do a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to make a strain that is
clone only into a seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, couldn't you just reverse it
and make feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes you could, but a lot of people do not
want feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rather have a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the difference between making
F2s, F3s, F4s and so forth versus back
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I taught that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a lot of fun with me.
