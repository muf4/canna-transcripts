[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 93 of the
grow from your heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming to you on a Thursday evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is finally cooled down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been hot as shit all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been hard to cool down today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for a little bit of
coolness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're getting a little bit of
sweet weather so that your grow room is
[SPEAKER_01]: not going crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These hot temps have everybody struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the fall is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have any sponsors this week,
you guys, but we do have some good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hardly ever have news that we want to
celebrate on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is definitely some news worth
celebrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to make my computer cooperate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting to the news article that I
want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article comes from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is written by Summer Ballantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the headline says, Jeff Mazinski
sentenced to life for pot freed from
[SPEAKER_01]: Missouri prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude spent 20 years in prison for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has been released from prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture of him shows him with a big
ass smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude looks happy to be out of prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wouldn't be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a huge article here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just get right into it and make this
podcast get down to business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for the article because my
computer is pissing me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Jeff Mazinski sentenced to life
for pot freed from Missouri prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I spent a third of my life in
prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's 62 after serving 20 years of a
life sentence without parole for
[SPEAKER_01]: non-violent marijuana related convictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article says, from Jefferson City,
Missouri, a man sentenced to life in
[SPEAKER_01]: prison without parole on a marijuana
related charge was freed Tuesday from
[SPEAKER_01]: Missouri prison after being behind bars
for two decades, a period in which the
[SPEAKER_01]: nation's attitudes toward pot have
steadily softened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Family, friends, supporters, and reporters
flocked to meet Jeff Mazinski as he
[SPEAKER_01]: stepped out of the Jefferson City
Correctional Center into a sunny morning
[SPEAKER_01]: wearing a pair of white tennis shoes and a
shirt that read, I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a shirt that says, I'm Jeff and I'm
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, he says, I spent a third of my
life in prison, said Mazinski,
[SPEAKER_01]: now 62, who was greeted by his infant
great granddaughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a breakfast of steak and eggs with
family, Mazinski said he planned to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: his post prison life seeking a job and
advocating for the legalization of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He criticized sentencing for some drug
related crimes as unfair and described his
[SPEAKER_01]: time behind bars as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: His release followed years of lobbying by
relatives, lawmakers, and others who
[SPEAKER_01]: argued that the sentence was too stiff and
that marijuana should not be forbidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mazinski was sentenced in 1996,
the same year California became the first
[SPEAKER_01]: state to legalize marijuana for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana is now legal in 23
states and recreational marijuana has been
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized in Alaska, Colorado,
Oregon, Washington State, and Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason he's getting out is because the
public clearly has changed its opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: about marijuana and it's just one of many
ways in which that has been reflected in
[SPEAKER_01]: recent years, said Mazinski's attorney,
Dan Vietz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such extreme cases should further fuel
changing perceptions of nonviolent drug
[SPEAKER_01]: crimes, said Michelle Dietsch,
a senior lecturer at the Lyndon B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Austin at Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long title, geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lyndon B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Austin, Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I don't have to say that shit in
my title every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, hi, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article says, these cases really
become exhibit A in the need for
[SPEAKER_01]: sentencing reform, said Dietsch,
I think that's how you said that,
[SPEAKER_01]: an attorney and expert in criminal justice
policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just last year, the heavily Republican
Missouri legislature passed a law to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: certain people with epilepsy to seek
treatment with the marijuana extract
[SPEAKER_01]: containing little of the chemical that
causes marijuana users to feel high and
[SPEAKER_01]: larger amounts of a chemical called
cannabidiol or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients can include babies,
Vietz said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody saw that coming, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty radical statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police said he conspired to sell six
pounds of marijuana to a dealer connected
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Mexican drug cartels.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, the life with no parole
sentences was allowed under a Missouri law
[SPEAKER_01]: for repeat drug offenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mazansky already had two drug convictions,
one for possession and one for sale of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in 1984 and another for
possession in 1991.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the only Missouri inmate serving
such a sentence for a nonviolent marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: related offense when Democratic Governor
Jay Nixon agreed in May to commute his
[SPEAKER_01]: sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: The commutation allowed Mazansky to argue
for his freedom before a parole board,
[SPEAKER_01]: which granted his request in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nixon's actions are a reflection of
political confidence in changing norms
[SPEAKER_01]: around marijuana use, said Cecilia
Klingle, a criminal justice policy expert
[SPEAKER_01]: at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
[SPEAKER_01]: The governor cited Mazansky's nonviolent
record, noting that none of his offenses
[SPEAKER_01]: involved selling drugs to children.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law under which he was originally
sentenced has since been changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other states are reevaluating punishment
for drug possession crimes motivated in
[SPEAKER_01]: large part by the high cost of imprisoning
low level nonviolent offenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys imagine how much it costs to keep
this dude in prison for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have sent people to, it costs
more money to send people to prison for
[SPEAKER_01]: years than it does to send somebody to
college, is what I recently read.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably could have sent three or four,
he was in there for 20 years, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: could have sent five or 10 people to
college for the cost that it costs to
[SPEAKER_01]: house him and nothing came of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe in the long term,
he will affect people being released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he did some good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's called a martyr,
is that what he was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he was a martyr.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it was worth it for the movement,
but not for him and not for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they could have fucking educated some
people for this cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna keep reading my article here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says in Connecticut, a new law will
make possession of small amounts of hard
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs, including heroin, cocaine and crack
cocaine, a misdemeanor for a first time
[SPEAKER_01]: offense, rather than allowing for the
current maximum seven year prison
[SPEAKER_01]: sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nebraska and Alabama expect to save
hundreds of millions of dollars by using
[SPEAKER_01]: new laws to cut down on the number of
offenders locked up for possessing small
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Missouri, backers of two ballot
initiatives to legalize pot have
[SPEAKER_01]: permission from the secretary of state to
begin collecting signatures to put the
[SPEAKER_01]: issue before voters in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another petition proposes reducing
sentences for nonviolent drug offenders
[SPEAKER_01]: who are serving time without opportunity
for parole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mizanski said he will not smoke marijuana
now that he's free, he's on parole after
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it ever becomes legal on the state
and federal level, Mizanski said,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big congratulations, welcome home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's gonna help out the movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're releasing one guy, why aren't
they gonna start releasing all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are in jail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that committed any nonviolent
cannabis crime, I think they should all
[SPEAKER_01]: just start releasing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go unlock the cage and let those
dudes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hand them a joint and a hundred bucks and
send them on their way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's my good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some other good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is article number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from the cannabis also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to give you a little catch up story
behind this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, let me see if they tell you in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there was recently a bunch of
marijuana products in Colorado that were
[SPEAKER_01]: taken off of the shelves because they were
suspected of having been produced with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that had been sprayed with
pesticides that are banned from the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana production laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have what's called the marijuana
enforcement division and they have made
[SPEAKER_01]: laws in conjunction with the department of
agriculture to regulate the sprays that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be put on these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recently on the first, a bunch of these
edibles and products were taken off of
[SPEAKER_01]: shelves because they were suspected to
have been made with contaminated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that article planned to read to you
when I opened up my computer today and
[SPEAKER_01]: went reading for news and seeing what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis has posted this article and
it says, update Denver pot products pass
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide test and the hold has been
lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna say that one more time just
to make it clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver pot products pass pesticide test
and the hold has been lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sub headline says marijuana products
from Mountain High Suckers and MMJ America
[SPEAKER_01]: showed no trace of an unapproved pesticide
listed among their ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company owners said they were using
old labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is by David Magoya from the
Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it on the cannabis and it goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver health officials Wednesday lifted a
day old order to hold hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana infused lozenges and raw
marijuana from two businesses after lab
[SPEAKER_01]: tests showed no trace of unapproved
pesticide listed among their ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The owners of Mountain High Suckers and
MMJ America each said they had been using
[SPEAKER_01]: old labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They included among their ingredients a
pesticide that today is not approved for
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pesticide spinosad had not been barred
for use when the labels were made,
[SPEAKER_01]: the owners said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like this was just an unfortunate
labeling issue, said Dan Roland,
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver spokesman for its office of
marijuana policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for my stumble there.
[SPEAKER_01]: State law requires marijuana companies to
list on their product labels all
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides, contaminants, and herbicides
used in the production process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city's enforcement action is the
latest in a series of actions related to
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides used on recreational and
medical marijuana because the drug remains
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US Environmental Protection Agency
will not establish any allowable pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: uses on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, no regulated pesticide can be
legally used on marijuana, but state
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture officials have said as long as
its use does not violate a pesticide's
[SPEAKER_01]: label warnings and restrictions,
it can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Monday, Denver warned businesses that
products listing unapproved pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: should be removed from shelves and
destroyed or returned to the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspectors ordered tests on the product
holds Tuesday after spotting spinosad
[SPEAKER_01]: listed among other ingredients of Mountain
High's lozenges and raw marijuana at MMJ
[SPEAKER_01]: America shop on Arapahoe Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The test did not detect spinosad,
city officials confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain High had been using old labels
from when it purchased marijuana trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: from a grower that had been using
spinosad, Mountain High co-owner Chad
[SPEAKER_01]: Trivel said.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was before the state said it could
not, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then it wasn't a problem,
Trivel said.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just didn't look back on the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on there, but the tests were clear,
undetected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never had a black mark before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only did we test negative for all
pesticides, we were told by the city that
[SPEAKER_01]: just crossing off the name because we
already had the bags printed was
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: MMJ owner Jake Salazar, that's what MMJ
owner Jake Salazar said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Officials later told him he needs to
reprint the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ordered pre-printed bags, 70,000 units
every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time we ordered them, this wasn't a
banned substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have to throw all of those bags
away and reorder 70,000 more without that
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient, which we clearly don't use,
Salazar said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state's list of pesticides approved
for use on marijuana has been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: drafting stage for about 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state will not say the pesticides are
safe for use on marijuana, only that their
[SPEAKER_01]: use does not violate label restrictions on
how they should be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some pesticides are so non-toxic that the
EPA does not require them to be registered
[SPEAKER_01]: nor restrict their use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those can be used on marijuana,
but the industry has complained that they
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't potent enough to eradicate the
kinds of pests and mildews that can
[SPEAKER_01]: decimate a crop potentially worth millions
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city in the spring held more than
100,000 marijuana plants at 11 grow
[SPEAKER_01]: operations over concerns that unapproved
pesticides had been used on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this article was from David Magoya,
and those products did not test for
[SPEAKER_01]: spinosad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using old labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this really sparks a little bit of
question in my mind because I advocate
[SPEAKER_01]: spinosad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like spinosad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used spinosad recently, so this has
me thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go in here and go to the
Department of Agriculture website and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out why, or whichever website it
is, it may be the MED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go and figure out why I'm not
allowed to use spinosad because I run a
[SPEAKER_01]: shop or I run a grow at a shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to find this list of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure where I find this list
of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that the operations manager at
the dispensary has it, so I ask him for
[SPEAKER_01]: that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not at that point yet, so I don't
need to know that, but I'm sure the
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Enforcement Division webpage has
a list of approved or unapproved
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we got to do is go there and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to know why spinosad has
been banned because I use that quite,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will definitely figure out why because
something that will help prevent this,
[SPEAKER_01]: every dispensary will now be required to
train all plant handlers in pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every dispensary needs on staff one person
that can train every new employee on
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to train them, you have to be
certified by the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take an applicator safety
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been required to do that since I am
the lead grower at this spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be studying and taking that test,
and then I will know a lot of stuff about
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides, and we will find out why
spinosad is unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Department of Agriculture
representative actually told me the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: that Eagle 20 is not allowed in commercial
grows, drum roll please, because when it
[SPEAKER_01]: burns, it turns into cyanide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the guy from the Department of
Agriculture told me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had nothing to do with the danger and
toxicity of the chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually because if there's a fire,
it turns into cyanide, and the fire
[SPEAKER_01]: department doesn't want to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that rather interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I have got one more
news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from local news here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from the beautiful city of
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked a little bit about Pueblo last
time on the last episode, talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: how Colorado and Pueblo in general was
booming with cannabis, and Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado may already be the new emerald
triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this article says, funding college
scholarships via pot grows proposed in
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the headline says, gosh, excuse my
throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink before we even
get into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink, and then I'm
going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that was a good drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse the throat clearing on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably won't even edit that,
so I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, there's no editing to be done in
this show, and I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm getting ready some amnesia
haze from our friends at Colorado's Best
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to take a fat chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are going to take a dab
with me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to the show,
get a dab ready, get a bowl ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're at work or something,
sneak your vape pen out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get stoned together.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the count of six, four, five,
six,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take dabs in the middle of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to smoke so much more hash on this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to get it a little
tighter and not be dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also helps my throat last longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amnesia haze from Colorado's Best
Dabs, and it makes my head fucking spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets me amped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me lively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothetically, if I were going to come
home on my lunch break and smoke a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of dabs and need to go back to work all
energized and in the zone, hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take four dabs of that,
and I'd be in the fucking zone when I went
[SPEAKER_01]: back to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get onto this next news article,
I am going to mention that I am recording
[SPEAKER_01]: this podcast live on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, all my friends on Periscope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys don't know what Periscope is,
make sure you, or don't make sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: but please, I invite you to use your
Android device or your iPhone device or
[SPEAKER_01]: your Apple device, and download an app
called Periscope, and then look for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rastajeff420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for me on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually daily, I will do a dab on
Periscope with my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get a chance to ask me a question,
and I will rant for several minutes on
[SPEAKER_01]: your question if it gets my brain going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check me out on Periscope, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody that's watching
on Periscope right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Nemo Punk?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, El Diablo?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see who else is on there unless
they send a comment or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what up to everybody that's on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you will join me on my next
Periscope video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I randomly decide that I want to
put the podcast on Periscope while I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it, and right now it's kind of cool
because I feel like I'm talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's somebody, just someone to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just staring into the computer
over here, I'm looking at my Periscope
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see them, but it feels like
they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've got another news article
up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a dab and got all fucking ADD and
sidetracked, but shout out to dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read the headline, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Funding college scholarships via pot grows
proposed in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sub headline says, Pueblo County
Commissioner Sal Pace says he hopes the
[SPEAKER_01]: measure that would institute a 5% excise
tax on wholesale marijuana transfers will
[SPEAKER_01]: give Pueblo kids a boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to read this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mixed opinions on this right now,
but it's by Jesse Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, of course, found it on our favorite
news website, The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I don't bring you all of the
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I select a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pick and choose what I think is best for
the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get enough news from me,
I can definitely recommend The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: High quality cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ran by a dude named Ricardo Baca who
was a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I support that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out if you don't get enough
from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Pueblo County Commissioner is proposing
a ballot measure for a program to fund
[SPEAKER_01]: college scholarships through a marijuana
excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commissioner Sal Pace says he hopes the
new measure will give Pueblo kids a boost
[SPEAKER_01]: and help fight college debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The County Commission is set to vote at
their Monday meeting on whether or not the
[SPEAKER_01]: proposal will be placed on November ballot
elections.
[SPEAKER_01]: The excise tax would be levied when
marijuana is transferred from cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: to a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pace's office said in a news release
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, he said that Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I read that really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo County's perfect economic and
weather conditions have created a boom of
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational cultivations without yet
generating a tax on these grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beginning in 2017, graduating seniors from
all high schools in Pueblo who attend a
[SPEAKER_01]: public college or university in Pueblo
County will be eligible for scholarships
[SPEAKER_01]: from the proposed program, the release
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every kid deserves an opportunity to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pace said in a statement, Pueblo County
has potential new tax revenue from a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana industry that can benefit the
kids of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ballot measure would propose a 5%
excise tax on recreational marijuana grows
[SPEAKER_01]: from Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_01]: It asks that on an annual basis,
no less than 50% of tax revenue be
[SPEAKER_01]: designated for scholarships.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50%?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're doing it for this,
shouldn't 100, where's the other 50 going
[SPEAKER_01]: Sal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the other 50% going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the rest of the revenue would be
used on community projects like Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: State Fair's streetscape refurbishment,
medical marijuana academic research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a feasibility study on the potential
connection of Amtrak Southwest Chief to
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those all sound like feasible options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seem like they're worth some
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The program may be expanded in future
years depending on revenue, the release
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler Henson, president of the Colorado
Cannabis Chamber of Commerce said he hopes
[SPEAKER_01]: the county commission will fully examine
the measure before sending it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under amendment 64, we gave local
governments the permission to make these
[SPEAKER_01]: excise taxes, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just caution the county
commissioners to look at how this will
[SPEAKER_01]: affect sales in Pueblo and the surrounding
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing I think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna add 5% more tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tax is already really high in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's approximately 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the exact percentage to tell
you the truth, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody on Periscope, maybe NemoPunk,
if you wanna throw up the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of tax, I'll say that on the
air, and I'll give you a shout out also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys follow my friend
NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He posts a lot of great cannabis shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: 17.5% plus the 10% excise tax that already
exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 27%, plus they're going to add
another five, which will make it 32%
[SPEAKER_01]: excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this extra excise tax is just gonna end
up falling on the customer in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how it works, which is going to
make cannabis tax 32% here in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means it's gonna be roughly $185 for
a quarter of cannabis, which is ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: when you can go to the street and you can
get probably, you can get an ounce for
[SPEAKER_01]: that price on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get an ounce for $200.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get an ounce for $150 on the
street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to turn around and put
everybody back at the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just gonna ruin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to squeeze too much blood
out of one turnip, I think is what my
[SPEAKER_01]: grandma used to say, trying to squeeze
blood out of a turnip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what these guys are trying
to do, and they're gonna crash the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I think that's enough
podcasts for this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go see Phish this weekend.
