[SPEAKER_01]: All right, welcome to the show podcast
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for episode 429 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting across the table from me is White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming and hanging out on this
special episode of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said special episode and you looked at
me like, why is it special?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it special?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're going to talk about a sort
of not so regular subject for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into that here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show, as always, is brought to you by
our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself some fresh new genetics in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we like to start the podcast off
by talking about what we are dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been dabbing some of this buffet
over here from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, buffet is not a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got a buffet of concentrates on the
table here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just recently, our most recent dab was
Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia mixed with
[SPEAKER_01]: Malibu Pure Kush Full Spectrum Extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Mike looks pale over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my bell's ringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Mike is nice and quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Mike coughed for about 20
minutes over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was the heat of the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're doing these insert dabs now
and you went in like four good pulls on
that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insert dab helps with the temp
control, which was a lot easier on my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the insert dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it may have backfired on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you thought you were going to go
in and take that third and fourth pull
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on that fourth one, I saw you do
the, oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You realized I just got too close to the
sun over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sweats have subsided.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready to roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people hate talking about the
weather, but it just switched from like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a hoodie and some pants to bro,
we need some shorts and flip flops out
[SPEAKER_01]: here real quick around here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, they say don't plant until after
Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year that rule proved fucking
super true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got snow like two days before and then
it was super warm on Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been every type of weather you
could imagine this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's just fucking gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hot today, but now it is gorgeous
this evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was saying is it is time to start
getting the air conditioners and the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter time equipment prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't done so already,
I changed the filters in the air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's time to upgrade some of your
blowers and exhaust fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fans in the room don't create cool air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fans in the room move around heat and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't cool anything off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to get some cooling in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for that sort of stuff in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already thought about it,
it is time to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperatures are going to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to start slowing down
productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is that time of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually at this point in the show,
I like to give shout outs to folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: have helped us out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's give a big shout out to my buddy

[SPEAKER_01]: Much appreciated everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the start of the show, I said it was
a special episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I rant for a long time about
comedy and comedy shows and other things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this time, let's talk about some
recent Colorado news.
[SPEAKER_01]: By now, people know what the fuck I'm
talking about because I said recent
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado news.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about the fact that
they keep saying this is the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The news articles all keep saying magic
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magic mushrooms have been decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the second thing we're going to
have to focus on in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing we need to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magic mushrooms have been
decriminalized in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psilocybin mushrooms have been
decriminalized in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I like that all of the
articles are calling them magic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little disappointed in that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit childish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're not into the culture and
when you're a news article and a news
[SPEAKER_01]: writer and a news source, I guess magic
mushrooms is really good catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks good on paper and it makes no
confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't think, well, do they mean
these kinds or these kinds?
[SPEAKER_01]: They know, like it's magic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first part that gets
attention is why are they calling it magic
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have decriminalized magic
mushrooms for personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not yet set possession limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, all that's still to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I was going to say is
other than magic mushrooms, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: first part that gets my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have decriminalized these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decriminalized is way different than
legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to give us a good rant on that
difference since you're kind of my legal
[SPEAKER_01]: guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest differences are decriminalized
means, and in this case it's spelled out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Denver mushroom law that it's now a
low enforcement priority for a police
[SPEAKER_00]: officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for an example, if you get caught
jaywalking and the cop realizes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a small bag of mushrooms in your
pocket, the cop is instructed to care more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the jaywalking.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, it's a huge step in the right
direction, but it's definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you checked out the comment sections on
any of the news stories, 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments assumed that there would be
mushroom dispensaries popping up
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I was going to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that we would have a big mushroom
tourism problem in Denver County because
[SPEAKER_00]: people would come from the world over to
enjoy the world's first mushroom market
[SPEAKER_00]: and none of that's coming to fruition with
this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't legalization like we have done
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is decriminalization of personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still illegal to possess or have or
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in just Denver County now,
or just the city of Denver rather,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're allowed to grow, possess,
and consume personal amounts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: privacy of your own home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have they decided, who decides what is a
personal amount of mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: The city council of Denver and different
elected officials in Denver are all going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to hammer this out over the next
six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bill gets signed into law the 16th of
May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just I think today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's midnight at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be Thursday if we want to be
technical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's rewind on a couple of things
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get caught, if you happen to be
walking in Denver, you get caught,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get caught for jaywalking or whatever,
and you've got some mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get pulled over for speeding and you
got your mushrooms in your backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they're in your backpack and
you weren't tripping, it's not a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: to have your mushrooms now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have your mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small possession personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to decide what we consider
personal possession now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to decide what we can cultivate
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to be a fun process watching
Denver try to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to be interesting to see
how and where they come up with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the info for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing most of this process will
involve people that were involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: putting this ballot initiative together
and passing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decriminalize Denver is the group's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping they're involved in the laws
being crafted as they move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we just let Denver city council
decide how much is a reasonable amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms to grow for personal use in your
own home, the number they come up with is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be insane one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be really small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd rather go way low than help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed like a six inch by six inch
plot of mushroom or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it'll be silly if they don't have
stakeholder input.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to see mushroom
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not legalized and it is still
illegal to sell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can produce your own mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get legally in most states,
you can acquire mushroom spores from the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado that it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the news reports say that it's
perfectly legal to buy spores online in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and have them shipped to your
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get your spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a small setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to teach you how to grow
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of people that have been
doing that for a hundred years on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is all over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can now legally get your spores in
Colorado, in Denver, in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next thing I wanted to touch
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magic mushrooms is a weird word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to have dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver County is the only place that this
is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a small section of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get your spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can produce your small personal amount
of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can harvest them and you can enjoy
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can possess them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a few things that you can
not do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot take your mushrooms to Red
Rocks legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not Denver County.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the good concert venues in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several good concert venues in
Denver proper, but most of the big ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: the arena that Fish plays at every year,
Dix, is not in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you specifically pick Fish?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to do, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's just all the big arenas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Rocks, not in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiddler's Green, not in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just leaves the little venues.
[SPEAKER_01]: What county is Fiddler's Green there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Arapahoe County?
[SPEAKER_00]: Arapahoe.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it really makes a really narrow
section of Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver County, just the middle part there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ogden Theater, the Bluebird Theater,
the Paramount, or the Fillmore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ogden, Fillmore, and Bluebird,
I think are the three in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Paramount, it's on 16th Street there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Fillmore?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll still be some good times to be
had though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty, but you're not allowed to consume
in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public intoxication is still a no-no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you just made it take a perfect turn
that I kind of wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've decriminalized something that has
never really been an issue before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem like there was a lot of
problems involving mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it does suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've had too many beers and you get
stopped for a cop going, hey, you've had
[SPEAKER_01]: too many beers, let's talk to you,
and you're okay, but you have mushrooms in
[SPEAKER_01]: your pocket, that could fuck things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were acting like an adult with
almost anything in your pocket and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not doing anything stupid, almost
everything is legal and or decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a responsible adult with almost
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's sort of how we do it in the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to have anything that's
legal or whatever until you do something
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid with it, like cars, guns,
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as nobody knows that you've
eaten three or four grams, or maybe just
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.2, as our buddy Tenasi recommends,
if nobody knows you've eaten a few grams
[SPEAKER_01]: of mushrooms and you were out,
you should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't go out gooning out, acting like
a weirdo, because that is still not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not legal to go out fucking bugging
out, staring off into space, watching the
[SPEAKER_01]: spiders crawl up your buddy's arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is embarrassing and it's still
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you want to do,
man, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things in the reporting
around this that made me laugh is just how
[SPEAKER_00]: few cases involve mushrooms in Colorado
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: One report I saw said three people in
Denver County last year were charged with
[SPEAKER_00]: a mushroom based offense and they were all
charged with distribution, which this law
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distribution is still a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the report I just read before we
hit record said it was a two or three year
[SPEAKER_00]: span.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd only been 11 cases involving
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a major summer concert tour
series through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If mushrooms were an issue, we would have
noticed in the numbers before now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few festivals that come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have quite a few very large concerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're accurate with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an age limit to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The mushrooms is at 18 or 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just decriminalized for possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's at 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not positive there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited and curious to see where
this goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the cultivation limits
because when legalized cannabis became a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, I was really curious about the
cultivation limits and the possession
[SPEAKER_01]: limits and kind of how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see how this goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really curious with all of the the
trending of micro dosing that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a large factor, a large role
in how we allow and manage the production
[SPEAKER_01]: and possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think since everybody's micro dosing,
it's become so popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people need to have it available
if that's a medicine that's working for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There definitely needs to be a legit like
regulated supply chain for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a ton of research coming out
all over the southwest in the West Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: on psychedelics being used to treat a
plethora of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from sleep problems to
depression to grief and loss or is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the process when you've been diagnosed
with a terminal illness and sort of coming
[SPEAKER_00]: to grips with that diagnosis being part of
your life now and the way forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been research going on in this
sector since the 60s, but it's all been
[SPEAKER_00]: super fringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is sort of the golden age in
opening up research that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking for the last 50 years.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And psychedelics and mushrooms is the next
frontier in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a psychedelic user.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a cannabis consumer and a cannabis
advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's as far as it goes with
mind expansion for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do you have an opinion on the
legalization of first off?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about mushrooms and then I'll
ask about other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask me policy wise and it's the
conversations Denver City Council is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have had for all drugs a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what you're trying to
prohibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why nuclear waste is regulated,
not prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things exist in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't wish them away and you can't
legislate morality.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back even to like the original
creation of the idea of the police,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not it's not designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not designed at all to protect you
from yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a function they can serve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can protect you from me, but they
can't protect you from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like asking a fat dude to fly by
flapping his arms really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not something that's physically
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asking him to do it is you being an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what prohibition is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply doesn't work and it creates all
sorts of horrible things on its own right
[SPEAKER_00]: just by prohibition existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to deal with all kinds of horrid
shit we wouldn't have to deal with if we
[SPEAKER_00]: just went another way with all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anytime you look at a list of drugs
ranked by harm, mushrooms is at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the list, which always surprised
me because they emphasized in the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: education I received in our public
education system that marijuana was sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the entry-level soft drug and mushrooms
were a big scary step up from that where
[SPEAKER_00]: like you could lose your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big rumor when I was in school was
everybody had a cousin who thought he was
[SPEAKER_00]: a glass of orange juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time you heard this story,
you would fucking cringe, but you heard it
[SPEAKER_00]: every three months from the time you were
eight till the time you were out of
[SPEAKER_00]: college.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just fucking nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afraid to get tipped over, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already ate too much acid though was the
story I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically any psychedelic and it
was always a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was fucking acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was peyote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never really my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just sort of ignored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a couple of funny stories
about having to like babysit a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: other people on mushrooms when I was in
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always volunteered to participate as
the babysitter in those excursions because
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms weren't my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was happy to go sober that night and
make sure all my other friends had a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've needed guys like you around
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had, I've, I on the other hand have
had some mushroom experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had lots of friends all the way
through that, that enjoyed mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just never my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a couple of people reach out to
me online recently as this vote came up,
[SPEAKER_00]: just saying like, Hey, I know you from the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I said like mushrooms aren't my
thing, like I've never, I've never really
[SPEAKER_00]: had an interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always kind of met with shock that
that that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a supporter and it's like,
it doesn't have anything to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms or the fact that they're super
safe for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you look at the harm caused by
drug consumption, mushrooms don't make the
[SPEAKER_00]: list of things you need to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to worry about more about what
you had for lunch today or the soda you're
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give you from somebody who is,
I mean, I used to be on fish tour and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen a bunch of Grateful Dead shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could tell by looking at me that I've
got some psychedelic experiences under my
[SPEAKER_01]: belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, and from my opinion,
you can't do mushrooms too many days in a
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't develop an addiction to that
type of a thing because you can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get physically addicted to
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too, it's too much of,
it's a brain workout.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're done tripping on enough
mushrooms, if you take a good dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, we're going to talk in a
minute about the difference between a
[SPEAKER_01]: micro dose and tripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take some people it's three grams,
some people it's four, guys like Tenasi
[SPEAKER_01]: and some other folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tenasi is a friend of mine that we'll meet
later on in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people know who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're taking a big heroic dose of,
of mushrooms, which makes you break
[SPEAKER_01]: through is what we call it, your body and
brain can't handle that multiple days in a
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's like having masturbated so
many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, I don't even want to do that
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one was enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good for so many, so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how a good mushroom trip is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Hey, you want some more
today?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, no, dude, I exercised my
brain so hard yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs a little rest today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think you can really
develop that type of an addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be possible for somebody out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the type of thing that most
people are going to get stuck on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you study drugs and drug use,
that's one of the things that comes up
[SPEAKER_00]: during psychedelics is they're not
addictive in the way that people think of
[SPEAKER_00]: it's as drugs as being addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not any sort of a scientist or doctor
in that realm, but I think it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it works on your brain and not the
other types of systems, which probably
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't experience, not a feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm going to print that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to print that out on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bradley, if you're listening, write a song
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that I really like about this is
it's the first step in a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about Denver County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a whole state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, there are a lot of people
here freaking the fuck out over what this
[SPEAKER_00]: means and what it says about a society.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that we're progressive and we're
forward thinking and we believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are adult enough to actually manage
their own lives and that we don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: government involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for my whole adult life,
we've needed to have a real adult
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about mistakes we've been
making for the last hundred years and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to move forward, understanding that
they're mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And drug prohibition is at the top of this
list for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally poisons every other aspect of
society and it does us absolutely zero
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter what drug you're
talking about, but steps like this where
[SPEAKER_00]: first we force them to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this started back with Denver
decriminalizing marijuana back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a slow inch to we've got
marijuana legalized in several states now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to start really having this
conversation about other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having had the marijuana conversation
already, especially in places like
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, where it's been a continuous
conversation for 20 years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the arguments for marijuana legalization,
a lot of them don't have anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with marijuana and they have to do with a
massively popular product, a black market
[SPEAKER_00]: and our attempts to prohibit all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're easily applied to every other
drug that we prohibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to get into it,
like we can go straight to heroin and
[SPEAKER_00]: fentanyl and argue that, which is where
most people tend to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it doesn't really matter what
you're talking about, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition makes the situation worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And legalization is where we need to head
with all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it were up to, if white Mike was
president or drug SAR or leader of the
[SPEAKER_01]: DEA, would you basically find a way to
allow every drug to be legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just, and you are not, you're not a
drug type of person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know that's weird to classify,
but there are people out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking love drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: People out there just want to get fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that will admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not that kind of guy, but you feel
that we should have the opportunity to,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I wanted to go out there and put crack
in my butt, you think I should be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think us trying to prohibit you from
getting crack is much more harmful than
[SPEAKER_00]: you having the availability to buy crack
in a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's literally nothing that people want
to buy that they can't buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our attempts to prohibit it,
make it more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it impure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like liquor store A never goes to war
with liquor store B in the street over
[SPEAKER_00]: customer bases or turf, but rival crack
dealers getting good shootouts all the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking time over customers and turf.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things inherent with having the
illegal market produce things that humans
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the tunes of billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The liquor store never finds you and
shoots you because you got a big old vodka
[SPEAKER_01]: debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to a liquor store to buy
liquor, you walk into a regulated business
[SPEAKER_00]: that's reasonably safe and you buy a
product that's specific and regulated and
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you buy a beer, it's stamped
right on the side three, two or six or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is legal in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you understand how that's going to
affect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a bag of heroin on the
street, you don't know if you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% pure, 30% pure, 60% pure, or 2% pure
laced with fentanyl and a fuckload of baby
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what the fuck you're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's major implications to that to the
end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further, like you could offer me all the
free heroin, like you could put down a
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo of heroin and be like, here,
take this home if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, no thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not interested in any heroin,
but like I appreciate the offer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because I understand what that
drug is capable of in a lot of other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just not interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you solve these things with
education and access to health care,
[SPEAKER_00]: not with the threat of jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you become, if you do, and I'm not even
going to go down the addiction as a
[SPEAKER_01]: disease path, but if you do become
addicted to something and you'd like some
[SPEAKER_01]: help, it is hard to reach out because now
you're a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been doing this, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a criminal thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be treated more as a health
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a health issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am addicted to fucking Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody is going to arrest me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should.
[SPEAKER_01]: For how many Dr. Peppers I've consumed
today, somebody should beat my ass,
[SPEAKER_01]: but nobody cares because it's Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since it's Dr. Pepper, that's my
addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one poisoning me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not hurting anybody except the one I
die.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to miss me, but we all
got to die anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like because you're talking about
caffeine, but because it's legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they tried to pull for local off the
shelf because they don't like when people
[SPEAKER_00]: mix a whole bunch of alcohol with a whole
bunch of caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most places like you'll see them on road
trips and truck stops by the register.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got like super duper caffeine
pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been attempts to get those off the
fucking market because every now and then
[SPEAKER_00]: some trucker ODs on them or some teenager
ODs on them and they end up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital in a serious medical event
because they've consumed hundreds of times
[SPEAKER_00]: the safe dose of caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that most drugs would work
themselves out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in most situations in my experience,
the way that I have learned to tolerate
[SPEAKER_01]: and handle almost anything I've been
given, whether it's chocolate milk,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made myself feel like shit with
chocolate milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how I learned?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried a little bit of it and then I had
a glass of it and I was like, chocolate
[SPEAKER_01]: milk's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want two glasses of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost fucking vegan now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had chocolate milk in probably
20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just picked something that I know would
give me a stomach ache.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I discovered chocolate milk,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this is fucking good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a glass of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had two glasses of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stomach felt fucking ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I want to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stomach hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I learned about alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I learned about chocolate milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I learned about how much cereal
I can eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I've learned how much kombucha
I can drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you learn how much pasta you
can eat before you want to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just exposing yourself to it and
not treating it like it's some crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking thing and giving you the
opportunity to learn and the choice if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want it or not, it gives you the ability
to make a decision and to learn and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience like, where is my limit to
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think most of the other drugs will
kind of work themselves out by,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see my buddy over there who tried the
heroin, just puking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go, I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I'll see the guy that ate a
little mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know my limit on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say, well, that looks like fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ate, how much did he eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he ate one gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much did he eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: He ate seven grams and he's laying on the
floor digging into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try one gram and then I'm
going to try two and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think people have, do you think
we're going to figure ourselves out like
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think a bunch of us are just
going to goon out and end up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: streets fucking full retard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think anybody who's going to goon
out and end up in the streets is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: With or without decriminalization,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with or without decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I was king of the world and
everything was legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the thing that's cool about
this law is it pushes the conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: forward another step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until marijuana was legal, like legal
legal, we didn't have any sort of concept
[SPEAKER_00]: of what an individual dose of a marijuana
edible would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then we've come up with sort of
guesstimates and we're working the kinks
[SPEAKER_00]: out of those right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is states legalized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's kind of doing it their own
little, every state's got to do it their
[SPEAKER_00]: special way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the next 20 years,
we're going to watch all that play out and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out, okay, maybe 10 was a little
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call it 15 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe 10 was a little high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call it seven and a half now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Denver's about to start that
conversation with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the next six months or a year,
the conversation in a very public and real
[SPEAKER_00]: way about, well, how much is a reasonable
amount of mushrooms for someone to grow at
[SPEAKER_00]: home?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're micro dosing to treat your
depression, what sort of growth setup is
[SPEAKER_00]: realistic for an amateur to produce enough
product for them to sustain their dose
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just a sometime concert goer,
what's a new dose for mushrooms where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have a pleasant
intoxicating experience rather than a,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got sick and threw up on everybody
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I ended up in the hospital while they
laughed at me and gave me water kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that conversation hasn't taken place
in the US before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling it took place in the
Netherlands because I know at least for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, you could buy mushrooms and a
lot of the head shops and coffee shops
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we definitely haven't had that
conversation in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as states move to decriminalize
mushrooms and other drugs, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations are going to have to take
place and how we legalize or how we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we regulate other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those conversations are going to have
to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other bills that they talked
about in Denver, this session was safe
[SPEAKER_00]: injection facilities and people freaked
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there's people are going to travel
across the country so they can do heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: in this train car they set up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's just a doctor on site in
case you do get something that's got more
[SPEAKER_00]: fentanyl in it than you were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up needing medical help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it fucking is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that a hardcore heroin addict
is going to have money to move across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country is just sort of bad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're finally having these
conversations in the US and I wasn't sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we were ever going to have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when I was studying this shit in
college, I was like, it's a fantasy that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're ever going to move this far forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because we love to do shit just
because that's how we do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decriminalization, black market is still
the source market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're left with all of the
problems of the production and
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution chain being illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like, I hate that marijuana has
grown on public land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love marijuana, but I also love our
national parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate that because it's illegal,
it's grown in national parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with all the other
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're produced in ways that are super
fucking destructive because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If heroin were legal, we wouldn't have
poppy fields all over different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet just fucking up the economy
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with coca production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it wouldn't be little kids stomping
on coca leaves in the fucking jungles of
[SPEAKER_00]: Peru so that people in New York could have
their blow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes sense to have this shit
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask me, feel free to send hate mail
to addnemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the listeners of this show
are going to hate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of the people that listen to
this show are open-minded and they're free
[SPEAKER_01]: thinkers and they would encourage other
people to think for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of us are informed and wise
enough to not do things to our body and
[SPEAKER_01]: our minds that aren't going to benefit us
in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you got to learn by seeing
and doing, but I think most of us are
[SPEAKER_01]: smart enough to make our own decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's two conversations that are
really pushing this forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, I mean, marijuana legalization is
a conversation that's happening in every
[SPEAKER_00]: corner of the US right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in places like Colorado, where it's
already happened, we're discussing how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's playing out and tweaks we need to
make to the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other conversation that's taking
place is law enforcement based and
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with how we police ourselves as a
society and changes we need to make to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think both of those conversations
happening at the same time are really
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing things like this Denver law
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the problems that prohibition
causes and they see how pointless our
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts have been and how wasteful they've
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of this is like when heroin
was legal before it was outlawed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most popular consumption method was a
low dose liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people always go straight to heroin
in this conversation and it's back when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was legal, man, it was fucking housewives
drinking laudanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a heroin junkie problem
until long after it had been made illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got everybody addicted to
fucking morphine in the army hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look it up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug history is interesting as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, thanks for coming and educating us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for about 30 somethingish
minutes now after a couple of quick edits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should probably start wrapping up
this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting kind of late.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably get you home back to
the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great show, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody listens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listening had a bunch of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's recap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up to you to decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on how many you eat, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spiritual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember what you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on how many you eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, they are not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are decriminalized, which is a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have too much, they will still
arrest you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, at this point, it is up to the
cop to decide how much is too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a backpack full and you're
trying to hook everybody up on the campus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to jail, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got enough so you can get a
couple of trips on this weekend,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be just fine probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Denver, the way they used to screw with
you back when marijuana was decriminalized
[SPEAKER_00]: is how many bags you had and if you had a
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went to your guy and tried to order
a quarter and they gave it to you in seven
[SPEAKER_00]: grand bags, I was always like,
you motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as possible, I had to get that
into one sandwich bag because if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: busted with seven, one grand bags,
you didn't buy a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to sell seven times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is intent to distribute if they
choose to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not all of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said earlier, most of the concert
venues, you are shit out of luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere outside of Denver, Pueblo,
Colorado Springs, Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_01]: Boulder, all still illegal possession for
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, I think it is time to
wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got any Mike's final thoughts,
sort of a Jerry's final thoughts,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a thing going on here at the end
of the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this up on social media?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media, I would appreciate it if you
find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, let's go for Cannabuzz this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabuzz is a new cannabis-friendly,
cannabis-based social media app.
[SPEAKER_01]: I post a lot of fine cannabis photography
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check me out on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you would enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Mike, would you like people to follow
your Facebook page?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check me out on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws,
or you can find me at Twitter at
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out his Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: He posts some great cannabis-friendly
rants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets some people trying to troll him on
there, and I think he just slays the
[SPEAKER_01]: trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
listening to this long, rambly episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had as much fun as Mike and I
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back in just a couple of days with
some fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to check out our sponsor,
Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, James Butterson, and until next
[SPEAKER_01]: time, take a fat dab and give your mama a
hug for me.
Thank you.
