one full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of GMO and Legend OG on

really digging the buzz from the Fatso OG
[SPEAKER_00]: on the back of the package.

detectable amounts of CBD.

[SPEAKER_00]: The last time we spoke, I had a couple of
shirts available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are now at the time of this episode
is being recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three shirts available on my
Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to actually if you visit
iregenetics.com and click on the store tab
[SPEAKER_00]: that will take you directly to my Etsy

[SPEAKER_00]: It is iregenetics.com click on the store
tab or simply go to Etsy search for ire
[SPEAKER_00]: gifts LLC that will get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to show you the fancy shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I think I showed you let's recap
what we showed last time and build
[SPEAKER_00]: suspense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on the video show on
YouTube, like I encourage you get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the lemon Jeffrey t shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm holding up now is a small that is
a small shirt just you know what size I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the lemon Jeffrey shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I'm going to show the camera
will be the orangegasm shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm showing the camera a small
just in case you're judging what size
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you should buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a small orangegasm shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the orange gasm logo says
iregenetics on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these shirts are they do have the
words iregenetics on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got my brand listed on there but
they are not blatantly cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have weed leaves or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have the orange for orangegasm and
the lemon for lemon Jeffrey on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my buttons on my shirt popped open
as I was showing you that we're getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little a little risque here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it's got the logo on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one may be my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the lemon Jeffrey would be my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the orangegasm would be my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all battled for favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the look on this little goat's face,
this golden goat shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving the look on the goat's face.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just looks nice and stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little stone goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the golden goat shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the shirt that I showed the
camera was a small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are looking for the shirts
once again, they are on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the store tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is under construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me three or four weeks and that
website will impress you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend who was working
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a couple of meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of us are doing late night meetings
trying to get this website going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both stone and half asleep trying to
communicate on a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting it going.

[SPEAKER_00]: Then send me a picture of yourself in the
shirt when I send it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what you look like and give
me permission to share it or tell me do or
[SPEAKER_00]: do not share this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post it up to social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get some followers and I'll get to
share what the shirts look like on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, where are we going
to go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Axel Rose said, where do we go now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the part of the show where
we jump into reading Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great big stack of emails and
messages here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much more time with my
stone rambles and let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple are going to be from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be mainly compliments and
praise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to move into some grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Smokey J and it goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got my mail from seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the easiest purchase I have ever
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got some shredder, Raphael and
Sunkiss from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a nice lineup, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the shredder for that like lemony
and funky turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael for that strawberry stuff and
Sunkiss for the orange turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to be a happy camper in a
few weeks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm very excited to get
them started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the five pack of Sunkiss actually
had seven seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make this message up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from an actual Patreon
subscriber who bought seeds and was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely happy with their experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found seven seeds in their five pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say you're going to find
five in yours, but sometimes that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in a good mood and we're packing up
seeds and I know that I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough seeds to fill the amount of
packages I made, I may just go put extra
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in there just to make sure you're
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys work really hard for your
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole time you're at work,
you're away from your job, you're away
from your job, you're away from your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is that makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us aren't as blessed as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built a career for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us aren't that blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go somewhere and listen to some
asshole tell you what to do all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do that all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be away from your Xbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be away from your loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be away from your puppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be away from Pornhub,
whatever it is that's got your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fucking do that because you're
working for some asshole all day just for
[SPEAKER_00]: enough money to barely get by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to work a few weeks and
save up a few weeks so you could buy some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to set yourselves up for
success when you get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do what I can to make sure you were
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get seven in a pack, that's almost
like 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 50% extra for free,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not good at math that quickly,
but I know that money's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that being away from home to make
money sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be with your family,
your puppy, your plants, your fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Xbox, whatever else you got at home going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you just want to be on the road
doing something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be at a fish show, having a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to be seeing whatever band
you want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that you trust me and
spend your money on my brand with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make sure to make sure that you are
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to stay happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you found seven seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make me proud when you grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a friend who is in need,
that wants to grow, that has never grown
[SPEAKER_00]: before, that's got some space,
maybe you could be a nice guy and pass on
[SPEAKER_00]: those extra two beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your friend growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if they find a winner also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you're an inspiration to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: To better my grow and better myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again so much from Smokey J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokey J, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two-way relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just did podcasts and made seeds that
weren't quality and nobody enjoyed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody appreciated it, I would probably
be, I think I'd be in a mental hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I set this gear up twice a week and
just did this and nobody cared,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be a sign of psycho or
psychotic or some weirdness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would need medication and a padded
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a two-way street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the seed business is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was just making seeds and selling
them and nobody purchased them,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody cared about them, I'd be hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your trust and your faith
in me and my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when I get talkative like this
because it makes good podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've got to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Smokey J and thank you
for the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, do they want their
name said?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it says right in the beginning,
it says, Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody needs to write that song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been listening every week for
about two years now and I'm almost,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly caught up with your back catalog
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's 573 episodes you've listened
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be sick of my own voice by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've learned a lot and I'm sure
you've got some questions by now and I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope you've heard the progression of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show has changed, evolved,
morphed, rotated a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do segments and shit at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to type out, almost everything I
was going to say throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: show would be written and I would sit here
and read a script.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I recommend you transplant
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you want to place your hand on top
of the soil and gently grip the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: then turn the pot upside down and shake it
gently until the pot comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was fucking, I was robotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't as much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a while to get comfortable doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like four notes and I just ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of fun now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for watching my journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching the evolution,
the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progression of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you listened to through the
episodes, when I had my head injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize and thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some episodes you guys in about
2015 around April.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was I hit my head and some of
the episodes are fucking goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't all there and people were
emailing me saying, Hey, what the fuck are
[SPEAKER_00]: you saying on this episode, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really couldn't tell you either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for being patient with
me and dealing with me through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get me back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's been listening for two years
caught up on the back catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shows keep getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting better at speaking,
getting better at podcasting, more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with this microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm becoming a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experienced and exposed to more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I go to a grow to a facility,
I still troll the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I used to, to read what's going on
and grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still watching all the hot breeders
trying to better myself every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I stopped and you guys will beat me and
you'll be way ahead of me and there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: no reason for me to have a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to stay training too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the sensei will get passed up by the
student.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been a Patreon contributor
for a year now, but I want to step it up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the seven 10 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't anybody out there, don't feel like
you have to contribute or you have to step
[SPEAKER_00]: up your contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a voluntary thing that I love and
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't do it, somebody out there
will cover it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Brad here just covered a couple
of people for the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get to listen and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't afford or support the
Patreon, just tell a friend to listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Brad, thank you for catching up on
all the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've increased my listens by 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening on Stitcher or Apple
podcasts or YouTube, I got 500 clicks out
[SPEAKER_00]: of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really moves the show along,
makes it more available on algorithms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for mentioning that the show
keeps getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad did write a quite lengthy email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to read it all here on the
episode, but it says the last two guys
[SPEAKER_00]: coughing was a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always enjoy when white Mike comes on
and you guys talk about the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that Mike, they enjoy our
rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need you to come back soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to come back just to do the
legalization part to come hang out again,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy loves your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says your recent episode on making
fem seeds was also very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when you get into some more of
the more unique topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if some of those in depth
lessons lose people or if you guys care or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love feeding feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also goes on to say, I also enjoy the
shows when Jesse is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he's getting into crunch time
with his grows this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more of this message,
but I wanted to cover the first crucial
[SPEAKER_00]: and important topics, a couple of
compliments and invitations for my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Jesse is a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure where Jesse is right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse could be in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse could be in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could be in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could be down the street from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where the dude is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He moves around a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes, Jesse, I'm fucking jealous
of your lifestyle, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I'm like, what are you doing
tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm flying to Tulsa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, we'll come over the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, I'm going to Mexico for
three days after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what are you even doing,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carefree floaty lifestyle is fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mike and Jesse, this isn't an official
formal invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener wants you guys back on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come on the show, gentlemen,
whether it's here in person, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom, you guys are invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Brad, I want to thank you for
the long message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wraps up with anyway, thanks for
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks for reading my long
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what my mouth said,
but my brain didn't make it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks for reading my long
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really any questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you choose to read this on one of
your feedback shows, there you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, you got in the feedback portion of
this show, you can use Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also fine for the 710 shout out
big shout out to our new friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad, for supporting the show with the 710
level or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says I hope I can meet you at an
event someday when this is all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great podcast from Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Brad, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that when this is over,
we do get to meet at the Dude Grows Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe at a one of the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna start listing them
because I'm just gonna get heartbroken
[SPEAKER_00]: that none of them are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Brad, thank you for the great message,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is all thanks and praise for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from Jay Tapa and it says your
grow lessons deserve my patronage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more impressed with you every day
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'm aiming to impress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that I do impress that feels
fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming out here to give you a quality
podcast and improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you're impressed and
thank you for the patronage.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow lessons earned that patronage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever have any questions or anything
like that, please feel free to reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend, Jay Tapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've got one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't hear that come through
the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna take a drink and make sure
that doesn't happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going really well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I was going way too fast in
the last podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what whatever I smoked before
the show just made my brain spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't keep up with my own brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all the compliments on
the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this one's going much more
smoothly from for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little hydration going on and we
will continue with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna edit this part out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you for all the compliments on
the new studio space slash office space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took your advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a light in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already tell a difference on the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new toys coming in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some time to go shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at some new gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna buy some new shit and do some
cool stuff for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate how many people have been
joining on and following the videos
[SPEAKER_00]: following the audio show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe it to you to kind of upgrade the
show a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the Patreon contributions will make
that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a new camera coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some lighting coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may get a new microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one sounds good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking at the SM 7b.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have it looks nice and
professional but this thing does it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anyway, I should quit rambling and
focus on this or again, we're gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: real long episode and that thing I just
said about doing a great show is not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: count anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our good friend
Tonto's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Tonto?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to hear from you big brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let me move it this way so I can look
toward the camera a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently taking in as much
information as my brain will handle on
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished episode 331 and had
someone email on how you and cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in some episodes people message me
and let me know how cannabis has impacted
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives and it said, I hadn't done so
in a while so I thought I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this type of feedback from my
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm a proud veteran of
Princess Patricia's Canadian Light
[SPEAKER_00]: Infantry or PPCLI for short, who sustained
both physical and mental injuries during
[SPEAKER_00]: my service.
[SPEAKER_00]: My condition affected me in my everyday
life in one way or another, which cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: has helped with immensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start by thanking you for putting
all that information effort and your own
[SPEAKER_00]: time plus guests on the internet for free
of charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much to unpack here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thank you for your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in Canada, but still you're a
soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put yourself out there and you've been
injured mentally and physically,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not fighting for my country,
but for your country and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: commendable and respectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by looking at me,
I'm not soldier material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably bitch out and cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be quite honest with you, they start
shooting at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna duck and cry and hope you've got
my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for having people's backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not meant for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not for war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not for battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There doesn't need to be any bloodshed and
killing and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all fucking smoke some dads and
have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the world doesn't fucking
work like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be, unfortunately,
there needs to be somebody protecting my
[SPEAKER_00]: high ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that you're out there
doing it because back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just find motherfuckers to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm tall and slender and healthy and
smart and fucking fast and agile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be at war.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go shoot people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do respect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never disrespect a soldier or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find my place in this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to make sure to catch up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for putting your life on the
line and getting injured, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, and you're welcome for all of the
free information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I owe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that even means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it comes out of me naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was compelled to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like I owed the world to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to bring my religion to the
world.
I know I'm not good enough but I don't
have the words to do this.
I just try.
And I love the way people talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just hurt my faithful talk into
this too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Josh says some stuff I've got to
listen and Josh said, Rasta, Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a podcast and teach all the people how
to grow weed because they love the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow weed and they love your photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you keep that to yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them home so they grow weed just as
good as yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought gear and I have a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came out of me playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drums happens the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh says, what if you put the beats here
instead of doing it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, yeah, I'm gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: shit works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I listen to jaw, follow jaws guidance
and give thanks for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't stray too far, things go really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this podcast comes, it has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd like spontaneously combust or
meltdown or something, if I didn't do this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just, it's got to be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's karmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I've got to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that I'm doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm putting my heart and soul into it,
my time and energy and it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do ask for Patreon contributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't put the show behind a paywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you can't help me on Patreon,
you still get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people on Patreon are they're in a
position where they can help and they do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm free of charge without this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I would have taken the
plunge into growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you've given me passion and some
purpose through growing this hobby of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and cannabis has had such a
profound positive impact on getting my
[SPEAKER_00]: health and my life back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes all of the money I spent on all
this equipment right here all the time I
[SPEAKER_00]: spent today setting up the time I spent
trying to balance this fucking light on
[SPEAKER_00]: the edge of my desk right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those couple of sentences make all of this
effort worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's somebody out there who soldiers,
I hate to even go down this thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: but soldiers take their own lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are in this type of position,
if they don't have something to live for,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they don't have a positive,
they cling to the negative, and they take
[SPEAKER_00]: their own lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have a lot of people out there who
don't have anything to live for,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're giving this person positive
light at the end of a dark, dark fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says we've given him passion and
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without passion and purpose, we get lonely
and dark and depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passion and purpose are what we live for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what keeps you inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without passion and purpose, you're
fucking couch potato, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given our friend passion and purpose
through growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hobby of growing cannabis has had a
profound impact on health and life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mental, physical, spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel better because you're spending
time with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're spending time with the plants,
you've got to think about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't think about the post-traumatic
stress that's in the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to focus on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting away from the PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got an outcome that you can be
proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to smoke that outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the PTSD, the problems, that's all
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to wake up tomorrow and go back in
the garden and do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we're feeling better,
spending time away from our own thoughts,
[SPEAKER_00]: spending time in the garden, we start
feeling better, consuming a product that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes us feel better, getting a better
attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maybe we can have better relationships
with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple things like that will compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe after a few months, you'll develop,
maybe that guy at the store that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your hat down because you don't want
to deal with the fucking cashier at the
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll say, hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll go, damn, that guy just told
me to have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's told me to have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of yelling at their wife when
they get home, they'll go, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: honey, I brought you a Snickers bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripples, you guys, ripples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got rambly there, but that's how
small ripples fucking happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get fucking focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Profound impact on getting your life and
health back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the next thing to tell you is
that you have provided a positive impact
[SPEAKER_00]: both on my mental health and my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are days where a hole of depression
has sucked me so far down that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even have the willpower to go water my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where your little voice,
little voice, bro, I got to turn up my
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just picking on you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where my little voice pops into
your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff says, be the best
grower I can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be all the thanks he needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, if you can't help me out on
Patreon, just take care of your plants the
[SPEAKER_00]: best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love them for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that PTSD and depression can be
a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I come on here and I smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had that head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were terrible thoughts in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't deal with what my brain was
doing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were dark, dark alleys that I didn't
want to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without good friends, I may have journeyed
down some of those alleys without my mama
[SPEAKER_00]: having my back without Mike checking on me
without all the other people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: around loving me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things may have not been as pretty as they
came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depression, PTSD can be a hell of a
bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hear my little voice in there and
you go, bro, just go water those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to make you so happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets you up and gets you moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross Jeff says, water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all the motivation I need that I
sometimes begin to the long crawl out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope on those days, you feel that extra
positivity vibe coming through the
[SPEAKER_00]: universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being such a positive
support to the community and to those like
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, this is probably my favorite email
I've gotten in a long time and I've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: some pretty cool messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says there are people who go through
life not knowing that they have truly
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted someone's life and also
potentially push them onto a different
[SPEAKER_00]: path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis and you have potentially given me
that push and have helped me during my
[SPEAKER_00]: long road of rehab over the last couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what path you have possibly sent me
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently upgrading my high school
courses to possibly go into a program for
[SPEAKER_00]: micro biology at a local college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, our friend here was having a hard
time struggling and is now upgrading high
[SPEAKER_00]: school courses and possibly going to a
program for microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sparking brains and changing futures
here at the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that my push was going
this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to let it go to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let it go to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you all the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can do anything else, if you have any
specific help that I can offer you,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be honored to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to microbiology college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even say the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to school for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with, I will end this with,
I want you to know that you have made a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in someone's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being an educator,
podcaster, grower, friend, breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a good human being from Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonto, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: These messages mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jokingly wrote that this message is like
recharge for my soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you just gave me my weekly dose
of recharge and I want to grow vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one click of emotions away from a
small tear in my eye, to tell you the
[SPEAKER_00]: honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fucking amazing message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recharging me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is inspiring and keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is what makes me do a free
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feedback like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonto, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump, handshake, salute.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect you and appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving because I've got a
lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how long I've been
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say we had to quit yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look good, feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've moved into the grow
question part of the stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move that message out of there
so you guys can't read my scribbles on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm insecure about my handwriting on
that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hanging out, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten so comfortable together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're as comfortable with me as I
am with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now, 574 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fucking party.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message comes from our friend Riley
in Illinois and it says, what up Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Riley from Illinois back with yet
another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love answering your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks again for all of your help
with my previous question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a hermaphrodite and it was likely
caused by an extension cord that has an
[SPEAKER_00]: orange light up tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that much light caused that plant to
herm, I would just get rid of those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, and I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those extension cords have the
orange light up tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it in the dark and you know
where to plug in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you mean, but I would still
reconsider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says, I sprayed the room down
and my next crop is looking beautiful with
[SPEAKER_00]: no intersex plants yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, keep an eye on them, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't have that problem
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've gotten rid of that
extension cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you checked that there were no
light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a brand new question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do have another question for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I accidentally left my UV supplement light
on overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it typically take for plants
to show hermaphroditic traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will one day of UV being on for 16 hours
while all of the other lights off cause
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant to herm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can't say 100% as there are
many other factors that can be at play,
[SPEAKER_00]: but any of your advice is greatly
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me write down a note that I forgot to
write.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notes on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend Riley here has left his UV
light on for 16 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it was on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flower, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in veg, this is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flower, I'm not sure why it
was on for 16 extra hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a 12-12 cycle that should have
gone off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the light stayed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a UV light stay on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I am not, educated in UV
lighting when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, cultivation, cannabis production,
commercial growing, feeding plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: loving plants, knowing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that lighting is my weakest
part of that whole subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the plants very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at plants and tell you what's
wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can breed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fix grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a little bit uneducated as not as
educated as I should be when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights and grow light technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those graphs and things my brain,
honestly, my brain just isn't interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain goes, nah, let's go look at
microbes or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go read about microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably shouldn't, but that's what my
brain chooses to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we like guys like Keith from
Blacksail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Keith from Blacksail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get you on the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come talk on my show about the McCree
curve and teach me about lighting and help
[SPEAKER_00]: me understand lighting a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my official invite to you,
Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll reach out via text here this week and
try to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I'm not educated in
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know enough about specifically
UVs to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about plants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be very, very plant
specific, very cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what plant you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have multiple plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will react differently than others to
this light error.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically the same as a light
leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had light interruptions during your
dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be very plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would watch for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch and see if you see male flowers
popping up on any branches of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look on the top branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look on the lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just look at the tops and think
you're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look down in the lower part of the plant
where you don't get a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look and see if you've got male flowers
popping up out of those buds anywhere on
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look very carefully on all of the plants
that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check now and then also keep checking
throughout the entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may take a little bit to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of your major parts of this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long until they pop up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may never see male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may never see pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may never see anthers, but you may get
seeds at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is hard to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not know exactly what happened
until you harvest and cut them down and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to chop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're trimming it, you'll know
if there are seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing buds with the calyxes
are just extra swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a seed inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then watch for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got seeds in there, I would say
grow some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have just accidentally made a
bunch of seeds for yourself to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did make seeds, don't be that guy
that decides to sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not sell these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are accidental seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not made for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly some of your grow friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some friends that need some
seeds, you can donate these seeds to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they come with a solid disclaimer,
hey, these were accidental light leak
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if these are going to be
hermaphrodites, if they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds, or if they're going to be
wild mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of potential to be
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got a lot of potential to be
real fucking hitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down Gorilla Glue number four was
an accidental pollination that made a
[SPEAKER_00]: champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that was a male female cross to
the best of my knowledge, but it was an
[SPEAKER_00]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that was a male female
pollination again, an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of controversy around the
Girl Scout cookies line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Girl Scout cookies was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody really knows what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it was bag seed, that's the same as
what you've got seed that came from buds
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grew out to be the biggest fucking
trend in cannabis for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the controversy and cannabis is
around that strain still is I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the real cross of it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies got real popular and it was bag
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the entire chem dog
family was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was some of the most amazing herb
ever found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem 91, Chem 4, Chem D, Chem Sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, all the subsequent chem crosses
that came from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those chem crosses came from one
bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what the story of chem
dog and the legend of the 13 beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is something that you should research
if you consider yourself a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: historian or someone that's really
interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a weed nerd, chem dog and the
legend of the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem bought some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 13 seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the chem dog lineage came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are seeds in your bud,
they are bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, they've got the
potential to be the next Chem 91,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next Gorilla Glue number four,
or they can also be the next thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up your garden and wreak havoc in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did make those seeds,
grow them yourself and see what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got some fun in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to grow seeds that you
made even if it was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you want to know how long until
you're going to see herm, seven to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days, probably maybe 14 days, maybe a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on how those plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what cuts you've got in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how sensitive they are to
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what their critical periods
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, excuse me, I'm not sure who
bred them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's up with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to give you any false
hope, but look out for seeds, look out for
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and just pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink and then I've
got one more thing to ramble about on this
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are seeded, they are not a total
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you've got a bunch of seeds to play
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're not available for market
or something you want to sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them, see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run 10 of them, run them in beer cups,
put them in a beer cup, veg them out till
[SPEAKER_00]: they're three and three quarters inches
tall, the size of a GI Joe and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: them into flower and see what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're in a beer cup, there are
only 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only wasting so much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they are seeded, you can still,
I wouldn't want to really smoke the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, but you got to clean the fucking
seeds out of the flower before you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like old school back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to do that, but you can
process and use seeded herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make bubble hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find out there's seeds in there,
run it through the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to separate the seeds
and everything just like you normally
[SPEAKER_00]: would.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are going to be right there in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still make bubble out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also still make BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of those guys that is still
running BHO, you can absolutely make BHO
[SPEAKER_00]: out of seeded products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make BHO, grind it up,
pull the seeds out, or just pack the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking seeded buds into the tube and
extract it just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're making diamonds and sauce,
do your method with the seeded product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the seeds out or don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'd recommend though,
do not press it if there are seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably obvious to most people,
but to some people, I am not certain that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not go pressing the seeded bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll blow up like popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like when you used to smoke a
seed in the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not a total loss even if it is
seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm making myself an edit note.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a total loss even if it is
seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make butters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably make salves and
topicals and whatever else you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't press it because you don't want
blowing up seeds like a popcorn bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish I could give you better advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could tell you exactly when
they're going to herm, if they are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to herm, but I don't know that that's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My best advice is keep an eye on each and
every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at every plant every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely look at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing work in there,
just look around at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what I call the growers gaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stare at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just slowly look across the room and
you'll go, oh, shit, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that intersex trait popping
up on one of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you're going to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping you don't to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Riley, I've been rambling for
quite a few minutes on your message.
