[SPEAKER_00]: I got a really cool email or a Facebook
message from somebody the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that message?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say your name on the show
because you didn't say if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you pointed that out because
that's part of what inspired me to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to write a book originally,
but I'm too scatterbrained to write it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a podcast and part of my goal
was to dispel a bunch of the bullshit that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see on the internet and in the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you realized that that's what
we're out and trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, I was halfway
through vegging a half dozen plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble buckets when I started listening to
the GFYH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Needless to say, I have seen the light and
I'm gearing up to switch to soil for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have planned with hopes of soon becoming
fully organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, don't worry about jumping in fully
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do what you can to get rid of those
buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start learning how to work soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read a few books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the TLO book like Sean and I were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll definitely get you started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get you a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to be too hardcore about going
fully organic right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to grow and adjust solely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want you to get there when you're
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, I would like to
gain some more insight and perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: from you on indoor soil setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've mentioned you hand water plants
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this consist of literally pouring the
water to each plant or some other system I
[SPEAKER_00]: am misunderstanding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on and says, thank you for
your time and effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to getting my hands on
some iry genetics as soon as they hit NGR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go with that first paragraph there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I mix my ... My personal caregiver
grows, our soil grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mix my nutrients into a large
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, my big batches are mixed up in a
Rubbermaid trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much I mix and I've got a mark
where it's 25 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix up a 25 gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using organic, you can't fuck with
the pH too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to accept what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using synthetic nutrients,
go ahead and fix your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a one gallon pitcher just like you'd
get at Target or wherever else you're
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stick the pitcher right in there and
pour it right into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I have a good gauge of how much
I'm putting into each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say this plant prefers a half a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant prefers a whole gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm actually hand watering just by
using a pitcher and dumping it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run 7 gallon pots are my favorites to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each 7 gallon pot takes a gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect mathematical equation to
know how many gallons you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, dude, thanks for the huge
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to prevent the ... What's it
called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The withdrawals by doing episodes more
often, but I don't want to burn you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I save material so that I have something
worth of shit so that I don't just show up
[SPEAKER_00]: and give you a crappy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got two shows worth of material in
a week, I'd definitely kick them out for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to send me a message on
Facebook, I would definitely appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read it out loud for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about what I
did this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last night ... Well, actually,
I'm recording at one in the morning on the
...
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the date right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the night of the 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turning into the 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The night before last, I guess,
we'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the honor to go see one of my
favorite reggae bands in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go see Morgan Heritage at
Cervantes Other Side in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove the two-hour drive by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are like, dude,
you drive up there by yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a podcast, take a couple dabs
before I leave, and it's a great trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you get there, you get to a
reggae show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white guy with dreadlocks to my
butt, and a lot of the reggae scene knows
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for 10 minutes by myself
before I made friends and bumped into
[SPEAKER_00]: people that I already knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not even going by myself,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Heritage came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that band tore it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Heritage is on fire right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into reggae, if you like good
harmonies, if you want to see a killer
[SPEAKER_00]: live reggae show, I fully recommend you go
check out Morgan Heritage while they're on
[SPEAKER_00]: tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their set list right now is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great mix from all their albums.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much, if I made a Morgan Heritage
playlist, they would have played it last
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Cervantes Other Side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Carlos and his
crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me feel like I was at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where my night got really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked out of the venue from seeing the
concert, and the band was gathering up by
[SPEAKER_00]: their tour bus across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't see them because the tour bus
is long and they're on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked to the corner where I could just
casually lean against a parking meter and
[SPEAKER_00]: stare into the Denver skyline and see the
band hanging out by their tour bus doing
[SPEAKER_00]: their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to bug them, but I just
wanted to observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cold, but it was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: After being in the concert, it was nice to
get some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm standing on the corner and the light
turns red and a car stops in front of me,
[SPEAKER_00]: a car stops in the far lane, and then a
car stops behind that car and rolls down
[SPEAKER_00]: the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy in the driver's seat yells,
hey, fuck you, dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just standing on the corner in
downtown Denver by myself at five points,
[SPEAKER_00]: like two in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to myself, this is about to get
sketchy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached in my pockets to see what I've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of dabs in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have anything that's going
to help me out in this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had money in my pocket and I had my
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much all they were going to do is
kick my ass and take my weed and money is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was assuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to ignore them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I thought being an
ostrich would help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ignore them and they'll go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude rolled down his window a little
further and he yelled another derogatory
[SPEAKER_00]: term about white guys with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't what I was worried about,
but I could look into the car and see that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was full.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were at least four, five,
maybe six people in that car and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking mad shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude said, fuck you, Rasta,
hardly salacei, is what he said to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when I was like, this guy knows
what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows I'm a Rasta man and he's got
hatred specifically for Rastafarians,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially white Rastas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I am and I'm all by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked down the block to the right and
the concert venue was a good half a block
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked down to the left and there's
nothing but fucking darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward and there's a coffee shop
that's closed to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me and this carload of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pulled up to the curb and rolled down
their window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking Chris Kossis from the
Source Genetics dude just picking on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I was not sure if I was about to
fight six people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I was about to run down an
alley and get chased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out it's some of my damn friends
that just flew in from California and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking for a spot to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerve-racking, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shit in my pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run up to the car and give him a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, I can tell by the look on
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy riding passenger seat was like,
why are you picking on this man?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The passenger had no idea who I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is like, dude, we're going to a
speakeasy that happens to be just several
[SPEAKER_00]: feet to the left of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk up the street, we'll park and we'll
meet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find a parking spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get out of the car and they all give
me hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a chick whose name I can never
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think her name is Daniella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I forgot your name again,
sweetie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Kossis, Jibs, a dude named Mike,
and another dude whose name I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have been high as shit,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We walked down the street and I can't
disclose the location of this place,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we walked down the street half a block
and there was a brown door that just
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like a normal door.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not an identifying marker on the
building, on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends knocks on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: A man opens some blinds and sees us,
opens the door, lets us into a small
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say anything because I wasn't
quite sure what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a new guy that just tagged
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invited me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude hands the guy at the door 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy shakes his hand and says all of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy comes and leads us to a little
further down the way and gives us a little
[SPEAKER_00]: seating area and we all sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's going on really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that we're going to this little
speakeasy, but it was two in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were serving drinks in this
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat down and I rolled, I had some
flowers on me from the concert that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: just been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rolled a nice sized joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kossis rolled a nice sized joint and my
buddy Jibs started taking dabs of
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Mike was to the right of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs start going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joints are going around and nobody
seemed to care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the only ones puffing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kossis pointed out that it may have been a
gay bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there were some gay folk in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what qualifies it as a gay
bar, but it had definitely a different
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a shit ton of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a pool table in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't shoot pool, but people were
shooting pool, having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were serving drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed there until 4.20 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never would have discovered that if
Kossis didn't scare the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, if you're listening to this,
bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it, but dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to have to fight six
people that night after a reggae show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had like the best reggae cleansing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was feeling so good after that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought I was going to have to
fight, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vibe totally changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that to your friends,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Chris, don't ever change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that shit to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kossis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jibs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole crew in that car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't cost me a dollar to hang out and
get lit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was cool to us in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciated that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm in the area, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else do we want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight, so I came home from the
speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was starting to snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking April in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snowing, snowing, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pushing my car sideways down I-25.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got home about six in the morning,
a little after six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slept, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slept most of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I woke up, got a little bit more
prepared for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I drove up to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs to see my buddy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played Hydro songs on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does the Secret Cup anthem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Pacifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I say it like pacifier,
it's pas-a-fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said pacifier like a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking pacifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny when you say it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Fortunate Youth at the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of friends with Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought a bunch of pretty high
quality concentrates with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, that dude travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on tour with an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got an e-nail in the tour van.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he took me down stage at the Black
Sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just started dabbing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed there's like six or eight,
seven or 10 people that want to come
[SPEAKER_00]: around and take dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dab all these guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all super kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go back upstairs from the
Black Sheep and this band walks out and
[SPEAKER_00]: starts playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that's all the people that
I just dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was totally dabbing out all the
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hyrie also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to, a super huge shout out to
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Pacifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Fortunate Youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a shout out to Hyrie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got those guys high as shit tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed my concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of compliments on the Black
Cherry Cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big ups to all the reggae bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: My week is off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll brag more about my Cannabis Cup
weekend on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough of me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you guys want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start on the serious shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, last week I told you we were
going to talk about this Edibles report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I skipped it because it was way too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, special report.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 months in, Edibles still a safety
concern for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink of some
root beer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll read the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, a year of debate, a slew of
labeling regulations and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: educational campaigns have not been
effective in answering a critical question
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding marijuana infused edible
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you stop a consumer from eating too
much?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like the way this is written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like super impactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 100% the drugs, Kim Goldman said at
the time, acknowledging that her son
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't read the government mandated
warnings on the packaging and ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: eating five times the state's recommended
dose for edible cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the recommended dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 25, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means he ate 125 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate 100 milligram, a cloddy bear the
other night and I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this dude doesn't do any cannabis
consumption until this point and he eats
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 milligrams, he was probably pretty
fucking high to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it goes on to say, much of the
regulatory debate around Edibles has
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on preventing accidental
ingestion, but the manner in which Edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: affected person raises the question
whether more should be done to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: buyers before they leave the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a learning curve for consumers of
Edibles, said Art Wei, Colorado state
[SPEAKER_00]: director of Prolegalization Drug Policy
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot escape the issue of personal
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, the industry should do all that
is reasonable in the formative years of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legalization to combat concerns
around Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly 5 million Edibles were sold in
Colorado shops in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are Edibles high, okay,
I'm gonna try that sentence again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are Edibles high is more delayed
and long lasting than smoking or
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizing cannabis, but some brands
continue to severely mismeasure their
[SPEAKER_00]: products potency, according to a new
Denver Post commissioned series of lab
[SPEAKER_00]: tests measuring THC's in 10 popular
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, you'll remember we did a
report on that way in the infancy of this
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of the companies were making
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A random person bought them and took them
to Steep Hill Labs and things that were
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming to have 100 milligrams were
having 10 and then also maybe 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was way off the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to even say what some of
these people ate when they got all fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up and did stupid stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I in the article?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this year, it seemed as if the
state's legislative pot docket had calmed
[SPEAKER_00]: down after a bustling 2014 of regulations
and rulemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Edibles alone, warning labels already
had been standardized with more
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligram doses of THC universally had
become individually wrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state was working on uniform lab
testing standards and users encountered
[SPEAKER_00]: educational campaigns at every turn,
movie theaters, pot shops, and interstate
[SPEAKER_00]: billboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that when you're buying
Edibles, I think you should be given a
[SPEAKER_00]: pamphlet or something would be a good
start because I've been to a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at a dispensary and the budtender
will say, hey, this is serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like take this seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people don't respect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think maybe if you gave them a
little paper so that they could read it,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them are going to throw it away,
but at least we gave them that paper and
[SPEAKER_00]: gave them the opportunity to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when people talk, it's easy just
to ignore us when we're at the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at all the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at all the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking about how much money you
can spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money comes flying out of your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the Edibles right in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if we gave you a little piece
of paper to read and kind of showed you
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit, that might be a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe make you sign something,
but then people don't even want to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: around if you have to sign something at
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first time I bought a
deca-dose chibichu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was when they first, first came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend had a shop and he invited me to
get a deca-dose and they made me sign a
[SPEAKER_00]: waiver to eat a deca-dose chibichu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it and they actually made me eat
it there because they didn't want me to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me to eat it there and I ate the
whole thing in front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to go on with the
article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in the wake of Goldman's death,
many recalled 19 year old Wyoming college
[SPEAKER_00]: student, Levi Tamba, who became agitated
after eating an infused cookie with more
[SPEAKER_00]: than six times the state's recommended
dose in March 2014 and leapt to his death
[SPEAKER_00]: from a Denver hotel balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denver coroner listed medical
intoxication as a significant condition
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to Tamba's death.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever been so high you wanted to
jump off the balcony, that's fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the Summit County coroner awaits
Goodman's toxicology reports in the coming
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, his death, be it related to
cannabis or not, served as a reminder that
[SPEAKER_00]: the Edibles' conversation is anything but
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we continue down this road,
we really need to keep an open mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: said Lewis Koski, director of Colorado's
marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue to say medical
marijuana enforcement division on accident
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what it started off as,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to consider various incidents that
occur and work on putting them into
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, as in, what things do we as
regulators have control over to making
[SPEAKER_00]: things more efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Koski looked to the Edibles work group
that met four times in 2014 to discuss
[SPEAKER_00]: making Edibles clearly identifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improving and simplifying the labels on
Edibles, reminding consumers that a single
[SPEAKER_00]: dose is 10 milligrams and to wait one to
two hours to feel the effect before
[SPEAKER_00]: ingesting more was discussed by the work
group, which included state officials,
[SPEAKER_00]: pot shop owners, representatives from
Edibles kitchens and Children's Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much, too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new rules are due January 1st,
but while these regulations might help
[SPEAKER_00]: curb accidental ingestions, it remains
unclear if they will stop individuals from
[SPEAKER_00]: eating too much, too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prominent Denver pot shop owner,
Ian Siebe, pointed to Goodman's suicide to
[SPEAKER_00]: illustrate how much tragedies can't always
be prevented by the state, the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and the regulations they draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a parent, but I was disappointed
because I know that if I have a friend or
[SPEAKER_00]: family member who's rambling incoherently
and not acting himself, I'm not leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: that person alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Siebe referred to Goodman's family,
who said he was acting erratically and he
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't recognize our presence almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never seen him like this,
but they still chose to leave him alone in
[SPEAKER_00]: the condo as they went to the hot tub
according to reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude was freaking out on a
cannabis edible, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he did was walked into the room
and shot himself and killed himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what sparked a lot of
the re-examination of the cannabis edible
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to Colorado and you eat some
edibles, respect that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't the brownies that your sister
used to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't the cookies that your mom
used to make back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are lab tested edibles made by
professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This started being made for medical
patients that had cancer, Crohn's disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: severe pain, cachexia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed a way to get these people well
and we weren't fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we figured out ways to make these
edibles right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that are not taking it seriously,
you're going to get fucked up and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be on the news and we're going to
laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to mess up our laws
on our edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how far we are into the show
and I'm going to read a couple more
[SPEAKER_00]: articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, we're 22 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might get another article, maybe two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to make sure we get this one
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to skip that one and
read this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for all the throat clearing
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said, if you come be on the
show, I have someone to talk to and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can talk while I clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is going to piss you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I found, where is this from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Worldnewsdailyreport.com and the article
is written by Bob Flanagan and it said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto creates first genetically
modified strain of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, St. Louis, Missouri, Monsanto,
the multi-billion agribusiness giant has
[SPEAKER_00]: announced today it has patented the first
genetically modified strain of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now Monsanto is a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell are they going to be at the
cup selling seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read this article for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the news that has been welcomed
by scientists and leaders of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture business alike as it moved
forward toward the industrial use of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and hemp products could bring a
major shift towards marijuana policies in
[SPEAKER_00]: the USA and ultimately to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under present US federal law, it is
illegal to possess, use, buy, sell or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate marijuana since the Controlled
Substances Act of 1970 classifies
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana as a schedule one drug,
although it has been decriminalized to
[SPEAKER_00]: some extent in certain states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto's interest in the field has been
interpreted by experts as the precursor to
[SPEAKER_00]: a major shift in marijuana policy in the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, as it is believed, the company
would not have invested so much time and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy if it not had previous knowledge of
the federal government's openness toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the future legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawyer and marijuana law specialist Edmond
Grosch of the Drug Policy Alliance admits
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto's involvement in marijuana
projects could definitely help the
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-legalization activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, federal law criminalizes
marijuana and hemp derivatives because
[SPEAKER_00]: public opinion is still against it and
legal commercial production in the US is
[SPEAKER_00]: currently handled by a patchwork of small
farmers whom are not trusted by investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A major player as Monsanto could bring
confidence within government and towards
[SPEAKER_00]: investors in the market if it were to own
a large part of the exploitable lands and
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is presently no way to control the
production of marijuana and the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: A GM strain produced by a company with the
credentials and prestige of Monsanto would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely lend a massive hand to
pro-legalization activists with the
[SPEAKER_00]: certain spheres of government and within
the business world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, although Monsanto's
testing on cannabis is only at an
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental stage, no plan has yet been
released by the agricultural business firm
[SPEAKER_00]: as to what purposes the patent strain
would be used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although specialists believe answers
should come this fall as rumors of a
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial new bill which could loosen
up laws around medical marijuana is
[SPEAKER_00]: reportedly scheduled to pass before
Congress coming this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Critics fear genetically modified cannabis
will mix with other strains and could
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the diversity of DNA, a reality
dismissed by most studies claim experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my own feelings about this
because I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all right, so I think Monsanto is
gonna find a strain or use a strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone they know has been working with
and they're gonna figure out ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate the genetic makeup of that
plant to tweak it, to be pest and mold
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant and grow the most desirable sets
of traits a grower could want,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see them breed like a high CBD
strain that everybody could grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be awesome if Monsanto made
a high CBD, low THC strain that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: put in your front yard and grow right next
to your shrubs?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow it worldwide, be pennies a
pound, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But fucking no, that's not what Monsanto
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they could do, but they're the
fucking devil so they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I think this is what's
gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna lead to a
commercialized strain that will definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be like cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, tobacco probably smelled
and tastes good and now it just smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like fucking car exhaust because it's half
crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think they're gonna do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a big part of why people choose to
medicate themselves with medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is because we don't want GMOs and
dangerous shit put into our bodies as
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've chosen to grow our own cannabis or
rely on a trustworthy caregiver like
[SPEAKER_00]: myself to grow the medical cannabis for us
so we don't have to buy pills and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: from a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only a matter of time before
Monsanto came into the cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my big conclusion on all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down some notes and I'm just
reading a little bullet points right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Monsanto teaming up with Big Pharma,
someone creating a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: program and Monsanto having the only
plants in that national medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll own the patents on the seeds so
nobody else can grow those seeds without
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to buy the seeds from
Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also have the monopoly by being
the only strains that are available in
[SPEAKER_00]: these medically regulated stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll set up a national medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like, oh, you guys want
legalized weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go, nationally legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're gonna say, where's the
weed gonna come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll say, we'll supply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna say, who's gonna grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gonna go, dun, dun,
dun, Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna get like that Monsanto OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what you want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That big 12% THC plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I see coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna get creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to prevent that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys all have to start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of work, but to grow
your own cannabis to be self-sufficient is
[SPEAKER_00]: not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're paying for an ounce right
now, if you're buying it on the street,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're buying it at a dispensary,
you can get better, safer, cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis by growing your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where to get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never support any Monsanto companies or
their subsidiaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotts, fucking all that stuff that is
available commercially is mostly Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all your gardening products,
that's mostly Monsanto shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotts Turf Builder, all the Miracle
Growth stuff, that is all Monsanto shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the bug sprays and shit you see at
all your local hardware stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly Monsanto products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to avoid that shit if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is a march on Monsanto on May
23rd across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google that.
[SPEAKER_00]: March on Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a part of that if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: People go out and march in the streets and
talk about how they do not want these
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically modified products on the
shelves in our stores, and they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: want Monsanto taking over our food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could rant on that for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely be keeping a personal eye
on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more news I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to check in and see how long we've
been recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go too long here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get fucking ADD on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read one more quick, quick news
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a quickie here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA is not only seizing less cannabis,
they're asking to increase their legal
[SPEAKER_00]: growth three times for medical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from the Leafly,
and who is it written by?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gets credit here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gets credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the Leafly is all, or Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the Drug Enforcement
Administration is seizing less cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: year over year according to its own
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, the agency confiscated and
destroyed 10.4 million cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas in 2013, the numbers fell to 4.4
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, the DEA seized 4.3 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steady decline can be attributed to
fewer funds being made available for
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement, partly due to the economic
recession and partly because both the
[SPEAKER_00]: public and government stance on cannabis
has softened considerably over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more states looking to legalize in
the next few years, as well as less
[SPEAKER_00]: funding being generated from local and
state police asset seizures, the downward
[SPEAKER_00]: trend should continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, the DEA is shifting from the
ones doing the confiscating to the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The administration has proposed to
increase the amount of cannabis it's
[SPEAKER_00]: legally allowed to produce by more than
300% in order to meet the demands of
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers who are studying the potential
medical benefits the plant has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it sounds weird that the DEA is
simultaneously seizing cannabis grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing their own plants for research
purposes, well, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fucking agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not only weird, that's
hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully we'll continue to see the
DEA shift its focus to regulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal market and focusing their efforts on
illegal grows and activity that damages
[SPEAKER_00]: the positive progress the industry is
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides, we do need more cannabis research
to help propel the industry forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the DEA can make it happen,
the administration is actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something positive for the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get more money for more research,
hopefully they do the right thing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're not trying to prove that
it's making people retarded or making
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking people turn into zombies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're actually trying to
research that it helps with cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps with seizures, it helps with
nausea, it helps with depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pisses me off that in Colorado PTSD is
not a qualifying condition to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really frustrating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the last news article I want to
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to close up all the news here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the growers meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to remind you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: April 26th at Hydro Indoor Growing
Supplies at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a growers meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people that have been on the
podcast will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence usually shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he doesn't have a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Adam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see you there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get some chicks to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just mean to call you chicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lady growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come join us, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always one lady grower there and
then the two ladies that work at the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want more ladies to come join the
grow team.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a news article about
women and growing that I want to read on a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't have time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else do we got going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to the grow meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: April 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about grow schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like keeping your grow rooms organized and
moving so that you don't have dead time in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of your rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also going to use that for a
future podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're going to talk about improving
your crops on a future podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get Jesse back for more outdoor
stuff and, of course, more organics with
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great episodes planned for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode will be the Cannabis Cup
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, it's going to be so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the shout outs and start
wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time for the end of this
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do I owe a shout out to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to Hippie Nurse
710, Chris Casas, Jibs, and the whole crew
[SPEAKER_00]: from last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to Hydro,
Pacifia, Fortunate Youth, Hyri,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's up, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good bumping into you and taking
some dabs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on for taking care of everybody like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a spot to plug in the email
in this club.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have any damn three prong
outlet spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got an extension cord that didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dabbed out that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we quickly got kicked out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't allowed to dab in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, Kevin had a torch and a rig in
his car and it was close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kevin saved the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to dab out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap up the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not going to put out another
episode until Monday, the 27th,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll see you on the 27th.
