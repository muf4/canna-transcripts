[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and it is time for episode 586 of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This evening I'm recording on Veterans
Day, so I'd like to start the show off
[SPEAKER_00]: with a big thank you shout out to all of
the veterans out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a few
Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those messages comes from a
veteran, another one comes from a listener
[SPEAKER_00]: with questions about selecting male plants
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to those Patreon messages,
you know I like to start the show off by
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of coin-style
live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Sugartown Express and
Lemon G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
a coin-style margarita on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a really long time since I've
had a coin-style margarita on the rocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm just going to agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 65.85% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD, so big shout out to the
coin-style live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do some shout outs to a
few members of the 710 Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who
support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[SPEAKER_00]: level or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's start it off
with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you shout out to our friend Rumble
Buns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a big thank you
shout out to our friend Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out and a
fist bump to Matt H.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a thank you shout out to a
longtime supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say thank you to Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Redbeard?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might be part of your gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a big Grow From
Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend Canna Organic, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends out there in
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to follow that one up with a
special thank you shout out to our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Glenn Gironi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the longtime support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a big thank you shout out
for another longtime supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a special thank you to the
CannaKrat and another longtime follower
[SPEAKER_00]: and supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say a special thank you to
Blackbird76.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big high five and a fist
bump to my friend Craig Compton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that one up with a special
thank you shout out to Michael Harper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast thank you shout out to the captain
and commander of the 710 Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
Lemur Priest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you and big shout out to
everybody who supports the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you for all of the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did include a link in the show notes
and in the video description to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and easy for everybody who's got
their hands full during the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that is enough rambling
and chatter at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into some of these
Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that the first message comes
from a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, this one goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says greetings and salutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this message finds you and all that
hear it safe and enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing the same, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say in episode 576,
you assisted a fellow veteran and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when I learned of your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they said apologies for taking so
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, no reason to apologize for just
discovering the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're able to listen and I'm
glad you're able to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do plan on helping more veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you heard when I assisted a
veteran, I did get a light into the hands
[SPEAKER_00]: of a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a brand new grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Keith at black sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to I read genetics in a veteran's
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are growing because we helped them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to the army for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be helping more veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have reached out needing
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people have reached out trying to
give out lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just one of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So connecting all of these people is
taking me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get it organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot going on, not making excuses,
just letting you know is in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more lights given out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm myself and a disabled veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suffered a botched Whipple surgery while
in the Navy in 2003 and willingly would
[SPEAKER_00]: provide proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: The statement about providing proof is
because I have mentioned on the show that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are too many people out there trying
to take advantage of kind people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people trying to take advantage
of the covid situation and they are taking
[SPEAKER_00]: donations and receiving gifts on
undeservingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it is a stolen valor is what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this veteran is just saying before you
even ask, I can prove that I'm a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to write in and tell me
you're a veteran and not ask for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, I believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message all tells me that you were a
veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt in there, but thank you
for backing that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say I have never grown,
but I've been a cannabis connoisseur for
[SPEAKER_00]: half of my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finally getting the courage to cut a
cold turkey cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: VA doctor recommended prescription opioids
after 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the veteran doctor was recommending a
prescribing opioids for the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's finally cut it off and found it
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we turned to the beautiful form of
gardening and found that not only do I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a great set of green lungs,
but I also have a green thumb to match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes, being a military person,
you have got, uh, what's the word
[SPEAKER_00]: dedication, uh, discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff is driven into you and
now you've got passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that dedication, passion,
discipline, you will be an amazing grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often find that people with a kitchen
background, they've got discipline and
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with a martial arts background,
wrestling backgrounds, people that
[SPEAKER_00]: wrestled in school, worked in kitchens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always good growers, good in the
gardens because they've got that
[SPEAKER_00]: determination, that discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he put passion behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turns those people into savages in
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on to say, I definitely don't
have much in the way of friends or family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you were a part of the ivory army.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, welcome to the gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so I enjoy your podcast and the
people I get to interact with in chat
[SPEAKER_00]: during the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that means you're hanging out in the
premieres on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being there on YouTube at
midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the shows do come out Monday night at
midnight, Monday morning at midnight and
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday morning at midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a premiere on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out, I chat with the gang that's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us, hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can meet our new veteran friend named
Mr. Be in the live chat with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's always a ramble fest,
some kind of a giggle fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dave's not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, OG purple thumb, a lot of great people
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't list all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say all your names right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get to be a long show, uh,
but come hang out with us on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to that's where our friend
is talking about that they hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to go on with, uh,
this and the podcast and the people I get
[SPEAKER_00]: are in or out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is, this is the, uh, let's see
this and the, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This and the assist shown to the,
I'm not going to edit that out for you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that I'm a real person.
[SPEAKER_00]: This and the assist shown to the lady
veteran is the reason for me deciding to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a $10 a month financial
contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm sure that being a disabled veteran
that, uh, you don't have a lot of spare
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 10 bucks means a lot to me that
you're on a very limited income.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a way that I know of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just go make extra money.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us can just go get a second job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do a side job, make some extra
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, you may lose some of your
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, thank you for contributing some of
that allotted money to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it goes on to say, um, Oh,
I wanted to put in there, uh, you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the iry army now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot less pushups and a lot more
bong rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a note that I wrote on my
paper, had to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it goes on to say not being able to
afford the high quality gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided that high quality information is
even better, especially when applied
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like we've got a MacGyver on our
hands here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like this kind of person,
someone that learns, they've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation, the determination,
the discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when there's a will, there is a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our MacGyver veteran friend here is
going to whip up some shit and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way he does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so ever since I listened to
episode five 76, I've been slowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been slowly listening to all of your
previous episodes while taking copious
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, I'm glad you're catching up and
learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am growing in a closet with a
complete home Depot grow kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that's been acquired by
wandering around home Depot, looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparable items to the vast array I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I implemented while learning about my
wonderful new craft and trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are a lot of great things at
home Depot that could definitely build you
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've got a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at home Depot looking for lighting
for this new area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new ceiling light up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably can't tell cause these lights
are overpowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new led ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that fucker is bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was there, I saw this big square
led light panel and I thought that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be an amazing grow light for somebody who
had to be stealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so there are things at home Depot at
Lowe's at your local hardware shop that
[SPEAKER_00]: will definitely get you through a grow,
build yourself a nice little MacGyver grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space, just like our veteran friend here
is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says I do have a grow question that
has alluded me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says knowing that our beautiful divas
can tolerate higher temperatures when
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is why push these higher
temps?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've also come across the information
that higher temperatures also destroy the
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are running high amounts of CO2 in
a grow room, we can also run higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessary, but you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, generally I'll keep the grow in the
low 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: High 70s, low 80s and flowering usually
79, 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go any higher than 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I try to say about 77, 82,
but I mean 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's summertime in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets hot sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try not to go any hotter than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a lot of CO2,
you can go 87, 88 degrees, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to go too much higher than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running CO2, the plants won't
react too poorly to that, but you do have
[SPEAKER_00]: that risk of burning off the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason most people are running the
heat a little bit higher with the CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't cool the room
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of investing in more cooling
equipment, they got CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is quite often the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, but that is a way,
if you've got a little bit too much heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't get it down that couple of
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't plug in another air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get more ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're struggling with two, three,
maybe four more degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend the money on CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get bigger, better, faster growth,
and you don't have to battle the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always the perfect solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have the high temp in the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just circumstance and it is
what was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was the easiest solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was the cheapest solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was the only solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are correct in all of the above
things that we can go higher temps with
[SPEAKER_00]: higher CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were also correct in thinking that
higher temperatures do volatize our
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the temperatures we are
getting, the differential between no CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: and CO2 temperature growth rooms are
enough to destroy too many terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a few degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting up to like, I don't even
want to say 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to start fucking with terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of what we're talking about,
I think comes from the old school grow
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, this came from when we
couldn't add another air conditioner or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the black market grow world or the
underground grow world or the free market
[SPEAKER_00]: grow world, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-regulated grow world where people
had to be a little bit more secretive,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't always ideal to run the CO2
without the air conditioner, but there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the reason I brought up old school
and back in the day, because we probably
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know as much about terps then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know we were cooking the terps
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just thought it's fucking cool
enough to let the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were probably just using the CO2
because they couldn't cool the room and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that heat is going to be
enough to disrupt and destroy the terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we didn't know about terps at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we weren't too worried about
the terpings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpings are kind of for a little while
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpings were just the word of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype was the word of the day for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps will go away and it's going to be
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was CBD for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that terps have been the hot thing,
we've all learned about terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're more concerned,
more educated and more worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we try not to get the room so hot,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think part of it was because we
couldn't add more air conditioning because
[SPEAKER_00]: we were in a black market grow world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think another part of it is because
we simply were not educated on terpings
[SPEAKER_00]: and the volatility of terpings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, in episode 581, you broach the
issue of somehow being able to verify if
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody is truly a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're able to incorporate
the services, but Omaha Steaks had a
[SPEAKER_00]: service called IDME where veterans are
able to confirm their veteran status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, most veterans could share a redacted
copy of their DD213 form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would gladly share my unredacted DD213
for some growers love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I trust you and respect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe you, my friend, you're not
trying to get one over on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to get anything from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually give to me on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe you fully trust in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that you are a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may use that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when my veteran friend Keith talks
to vets, he can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like when a surfer talks to a
surfer, a grower talks to a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: a drummer talks to a drummer, some stuff
you just can't fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we will catch on eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, if somebody needs to lie to
us, that fucking bad to get a lie and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to say they're a veteran and
be that shitty of a person, we'll give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll still grow and they still
get to be a shitty person inside and know
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they can grow and grow out of being
a shitty person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good way to vet people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can we can throw this out there if
we need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, please give up a
personal shout out dab and a fist bump and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially and especially resonance hand
salute to all of the military veterans and
[SPEAKER_00]: their family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is Veterans Day as I record now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's send up a big high five,
a fist bump, a resonance sticky handshake
[SPEAKER_00]: and a big fat bong rip, a fat joint and a
big old dab of freedom for all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not cut out for war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that shit wouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen that I just just the
world that we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you're out there doing
it because I am not fit for that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to our friend, Mr. I think I
should call you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our last veteran was a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I better be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any grow questions out
there, I'd love to hear back from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a Patreon member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to me on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this episode will get extremely long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a familiar friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, North?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you again, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywho, Rasta Jeff, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got these bright lights in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out with all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think things are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I wish you well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to my question, I just wanted
to mention that maybe you should brighten
[SPEAKER_00]: up your background with your new studio a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may put some plants right here and here
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may leave it spacious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little mini Rasta Jeff on the desk
today hanging out with us trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: decorate without clutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going because I am getting
rambly from that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it's still kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question is I have a couple of
male arise plants leaving their vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage that just passed some rigorous
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I need to wait for this stem
rub smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is your number one favorite spot
on the plant to get a good stem rub smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he follows it up with this big
old question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are your top five traits you use
to select males, both for flavor and for
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, peace, love and respect?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the very first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're trying to predict what a
plant's going to smell like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage, it is very common just
to give that stem a rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind that stem rub is not
going to tell you what the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to smell like in flower in the
finished stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you a good hint of some
of the aromas available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm looking for in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what those veg flavors translate to
and convert to later down the line in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a male plant that kind of smells
like puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds disgusting,
but the male plants that have a mothball
[SPEAKER_00]: and vomit sort of aroma always put out
amazing terpenes once they pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: something and that stuff flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a very good starting
ingredient, mothballs and puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound disgusting to you now,
but when you get some cannabis that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: and or tastes like mothballs and puke,
you're going to be ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromas are going to be tremendous and
thick and heavy and the buzz will be
[SPEAKER_00]: delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something I really enjoy is the
vomit mothball sort of a bar trash can
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented funk sort of an aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that in a male stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: When and where do I rub?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rub everywhere and rub often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get in there and violate that bitch's
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can touch wherever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use another hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it another rub in another spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rub your hands on your pants and act like
you're getting that all all that smell
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if they smell like pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then fucking rub that stem somewhere else
and give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all over that fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can violate the fuck out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get in there and touch it all over the
place to see what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll pull off a big leaf and
just squish that leaf around in my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what kind of smells I get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get in there and smell the shit
out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all over the place for stem rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, start low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go up higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the essence of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your baby girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and enjoy it the best you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about five traits that I
may look for when selecting a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question to ask a
breeder with a very prolific male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been becoming very popular lately in
the breeding scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I look for when it comes to
breeding from a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want some slow shit to be growing
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I plant those plants, I want to watch
that seedling go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want the most vigorous,
fastest growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is usually that one is too much male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have too much male dominance
in the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you just took this one male
and crossed it to anything, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else you cross it to is going to come out
like that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make a bunch of
out-crosses that are that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to find a male that
complements all of the females you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want that first tall male,
but I want one that's got a lot of vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, good growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not the run, not the slow,
wispy, shitty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the one we're all waiting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a good, vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I look for shape and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the shape of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the structure of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the branches hold themselves up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make a big, thick stalk and nice
robust branches or does it make a wispy,
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty middle stalk and then try to branch
out real crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it branch evenly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you've got to have your goal in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've got written down
here toward the end, but the shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: structure are all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a plant that you're going to
be able to scrog out real well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want one that you could top and
makes a lot of nice branching that are all
[SPEAKER_00]: the same length.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the kind of guy that doesn't do
scrogging and you do the trees with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pole in the middle with a monocropping
with a monopole, maybe you want those
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa style plants to grow long and
skinny and just long skinny branches up
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe you want a short squatty
indica plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like if you want to make chocolate
you got to put some chocolate in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make some something else,
I'm not a cook, so I don't even know where
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with this, but if you want chocolate
in it, you got to have chocolate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want vanilla in it, you got to have
vanilla in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how the male plant works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good structure and a good
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure and the shape are going to
be a lot of what goes into your your
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a good structure and a good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at leaf size.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to tell you a lot also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also look for aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that I like that bar trash
can, moth balls, dirty feet, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: funky disgustingness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those aromas that always translates
into a good, stinky offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progeny will smell gross and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get that funky mothball puke aroma
with whatever you're crossing it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my Arise male has like a funky,
cushy sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you rub the stem, it's like sweet
vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like somebody had too much cheesecake
and beer and threw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what it smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry cheesecake and vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little, maybe bubblegum in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, that's fucking disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you cross it with a plant like
Platinum Tangy, which smells like just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight oranges and it comes off like
gassy oranges and it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I really look for when I'm
picking male plants is flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't grow a male plant
out past two or three weeks because they
[SPEAKER_00]: go into panic mode and got to get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even some breeders never get to see their
male plants past week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have posted pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got pictures of several male plants
in rooms that are past week nine and 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe into week 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to see what these plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know how long it takes them to
get into full flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are they going to continue to
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they look like if you flower them
for a really long time?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I let them go for a long time,
do I see any problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep the leaves nice and healthy
all the way through their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those male plants, here's another
thing, are they susceptible or resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to bugs and mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got powdery mildew or spider mites
in one area, I'll take that male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: over there and see how that male plant
reacts to those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to abuse my male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vigor, structure, aroma, flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the first males to flower and
show me that they're males.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one that's super hyper vigorous,
hyper dominant, hyper ready to just be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I'm a boy, let's pollinate shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little bit too dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that much testosterone in my
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just going to make everybody else
just a bunch of meatheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to dominate the mix,
not what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want the one, if I have 10 seeds,
I talk about this a lot, if I have 10
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, hypothetically 10 regular seeds,
hypothetically five will be males,
[SPEAKER_00]: five will be girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of those five girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow the boys this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first plant that shows me it's a male
will probably get cold because he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: too much male energy to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want him in there spreading all
that male gene back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make a new hybrid, not just
reproductions of this male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get rid of that first guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second guy might get a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That third and fourth guy is usually where
I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth one is slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's lagging.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, three and four are the candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually number three and four are the ones
I choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good track record for choosing
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've got a good criteria and
scenario for picking my boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want the one that is too
vigorous right out of the gate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want one that goes into flower and
starts producing pollen at a reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: time around day 21, 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a lot of pollen coming out
around day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want him going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to see how he goes,
how long until he reaches that full
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, then how long until he stops
producing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder making a lot of seeds,
that's very important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I really like to find
in a male plant is trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see trichome and resin development on
a male plant early in flower, that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it is going to pass trichomes
onto the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females naturally make trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your males are making trichomes,
too, you got two ingredients with
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of trichome production is what that
means to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: More trichomes, more cannabinoids,
more cannabinoids, a better buzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: more desirable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's got trichomes on it,
you want to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've gone past five by now,
but let's keep talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I really like is a good
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're posting pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a good color comes out of my male
plants, that is a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get some nice fall, wintery
colors in there, that is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some oranges, some purple, some dark
colored hues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that is always a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen purple trichomes come out of
male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen male plants produce purple male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and breed, use a bunch of
male plants, grow them, see what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the best way, the only real way to
test those males is to germinate and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you have made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things to test when you
get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well do those seeds germinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: However many, if you made 100 seeds,
maybe germinate, 10 of them and just see
[SPEAKER_00]: how, with intentions, not even to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a germ test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you normally germinate,
I do the paper towel method, throw 10 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper towel, germinate them,
count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got seven of them, 70% germination
rate, that's not super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100, you're fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess 100 is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 is fucking way acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how many germinate, see how many duds
you have, then grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said, you don't have intentions to
grow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fucking grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we change our mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's see if there are any
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if there are any mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if there are any fucking
weirdos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if they even make it to the veg
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just die out and turn into duds
before they get that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's see if they're hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if they show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got the next fucking chem dog
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got the new golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just bred the new fucking
Skittles in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what you've got until you
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, grow it in perfect conditions and see
what you come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does well in perfect conditions,
our next step is to take it to a fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room and grow it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a friend who always gets a
certain problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that that one guy always has
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that one grow over there always has
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one dude always gets thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take these plants to a couple of
those places and find out what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: when we put them in a room with thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when we put them near powdery
mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when we treat them too hot
and too cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they reply to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they react?
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants freak out right away,
that is not something for market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it may be something you want to grow
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those are the ways that I check and
audition and select male plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I base it off of vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I base it off of the shape and the
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check out the aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it stem rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pay attention to how long it takes
to flower, how much pollen it produces for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I look for trichomes and colors and
just anything else that may stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a breeder and a grower that has had
access to a lot of rooms, a lot of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: like when I work in commercial facilities,
my numbers to grow are much expanded
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to a lot of other people's
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've gotten to see a lot of male
plants and that makes it much easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to select.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got 10, one may not stand
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 100, one of them is going to
say, I am the bad motherfucker in this
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you've got to work with,
but you really start seeing more
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities, more standouts when you
work with larger populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those outliers are more obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become more present, more available
when you work with a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've got a lot of experience picking
boys and like I said before, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pretty good track record at
picking male plants for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, it is all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want plants that are short and
squat and smell like oranges?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to find a short, squatty male
and a female that smells like oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want plants that are tall and lanky
and smell like strawberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you find a tall, lanky male plant
and a girl that smells like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your overall goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of all, have fun, grow from your
heart, breed with love and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you test everything before you give it to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just growing it for
yourself, have fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a bunch of seeds, grow the shit out
of them, take a lot of notes and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are you going to do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to back cross and try to
lock in a trait?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to F2 and try to stabilize
some things, figure out what you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always more fun to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you start breeding,
you want to breed more, then you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed more and then you want to breed more
and then you want to grow those and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just turns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you turn into me that you then you
end up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I want to thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: North, I think I got really rambling on
