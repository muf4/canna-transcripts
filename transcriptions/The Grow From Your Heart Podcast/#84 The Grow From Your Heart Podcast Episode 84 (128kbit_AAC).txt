[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 84 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Ross DeGef.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me use their music on the show
and I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat Coutt and the Antique
entire Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everyone's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting across the table for me today is
our good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a quick day at work, had some time to
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd have you come over and throw
on a podcast before you go do your
[SPEAKER_01]: activism stuff you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got just enough time to get an
episode in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we sure do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get it out kind of quickly,
but we'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll kind of get to the point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do some news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing some news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing some news stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do have to do one
quick ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to
[SPEAKER_01]: you by me out every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, before I go too far and it leaves my
mind, I want to give a huge shout out to a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy by the name of Brian Meyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if it's Meyer or Meyer,
but Brian, big shout out, much
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian hit that PayPal donation button and
threw a few bucks at the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll help us with some upgrades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on getting a portable
recording device.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the Zune H6 so that I could take
the show on the road a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: My recording gear that I have now is kind
of bulky.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but the device I'm looking at will be
able to go to any event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be able to go anywhere on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep it in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have podcasts coming from all kinds
of crazy places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those donations help a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will work out in the very near
future, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody out there wants to sponsor the
podcast, just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all the information you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get your product advertised to a
target audience of about 5,000 people per
[SPEAKER_01]: week, plus all the people that go back and
listen to the cataloged episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really good idea to advertise
with a cannabis-related podcast because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that's all the advertising I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some news articles here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current news Mike informed me of,
today was the day that the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Public Health and
Environment actually decided to deny PTSD
[SPEAKER_01]: as a qualifying condition for medically
recommended cannabis in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Colorado, there are eight qualifying
conditions and all eight of them were
[SPEAKER_02]: passed by the law back in 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CDPHE hasn't added a single
qualifying condition in all that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the third time they've denied
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think PTSD is definitely a
qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bullshit that they're not allowing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in our days working the counter,
how many people came in specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, I've got PTSD, marijuana helps so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you guys are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment basically giving
[SPEAKER_01]: their finger to veterans and telling
veterans to go drink alcohol instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming cannabis to help themselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically been the effect of their
policy for the last decade or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, what they were trying to do is
people that have PTSD, they were trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that as a qualifying condition to get
your medical marijuana recommendation from
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctor here in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been denied three times now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot get a post-traumatic stress
disorder as a condition that is qualified
[SPEAKER_01]: that could be treated with medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just vets.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people out in the
community that have PTSD and marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: helps a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they can't sit down and talk to
their doctor about using cannabis directly
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd have to, if they wanted to join the
medical program, have to have one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other eight qualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least here they can still visit the
rec market and just pay a lot more than
[SPEAKER_02]: they would in our medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which doesn't allow them to grow the
product that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big part of having your medical
marijuana card is being able to grow or
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to assign a caregiver to grow
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to do three plants in your
backyard, or if that's allowed in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area and whatnot, it's just brutal,
difficult already.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're already suffering PTSD,
now you've got to protect yourself from
[SPEAKER_02]: all the paranoia that comes with growing
marijuana for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a large portion of the population
has some form of post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder, whether it be childhood trauma,
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see something very little when
you're a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a psychology kid, a psychology
student.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something really little when you're a kid
can really fuck you up permanently if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't take it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a study looking at kids in some
of the rougher parts of Chicago and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like 80% of the kids exhibited some
symptoms of PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people have started calling
it just, they've dropped the D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's no longer disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what the human body and brain does
after a seriously traumatic incident
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people coming home from war
or that have witnessed domestic violence
[SPEAKER_02]: or been victim of domestic violence or
have car crashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen somebody die in a car crash and
it's in the back of my mind every time
[SPEAKER_01]: we're on the highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always get a little flashback of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like U-turns for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've told me that amazing story there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was headed for is I was going to
imply that I don't know what event it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know there's some sort of
post-traumatic stress in my mind from my
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I said everybody's probably
got it because I don't have a significant
[SPEAKER_01]: event that I can recall, but I have seen
some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that when I feel, even if
you've got stress of the day, when you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke, it distracts you and it calms that
part of your brain down and it allows you
[SPEAKER_01]: to not obsess on that thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lets you kind of break free of that
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing, a lot of the people that I
know that we're treating their PTSD with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis would talk about is the dreamless
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the big benefit that they talk
about, at least when they were in the
[SPEAKER_02]: shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would stop their dreams.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I barely dream and I attribute
that to cannabis use because when I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke, I have very vivid dreams just
regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's odd because people have asked me
what I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, I like to smoke a heavy,
heavy sativa right before bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it makes my mind do that wandering
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I close my eyes and I feel like I
just dream instantly because I'm already
[SPEAKER_01]: right there at that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you smoke that really high head,
high sativa and I just close my eyes and
[SPEAKER_01]: then my dreams are claymation and they
just happen as soon as my eyes close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I sleep really well on a heavy
sativa and I have huge dreams from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of strange that it stops
other people's dreams, which I'm not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to argue that if it's working for them,
that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I asked you one day, like you still
dream, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you looked at me like offended,
like offended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have amazing dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just assumed that the effect was
something you got too, cause you consume
[SPEAKER_02]: way more than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I can control my dreams a little
bit, but if I get too carried away,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake myself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I know I'm like, eh, don't
influence this dream too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also kind of guide it a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but if I, if I push too hard,
I wake myself up out of the dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't had a dream in like eight
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dream constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake up talking, oh shit, or something
like that out of a dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, if you guys are working on getting
medical marijuana in your area,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your state, please, while you're
writing the bills, while you're writing
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules, please put in some sort of a
clause that includes post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that you can see,
but it is something that definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we need it for our veterans more than
anything, but it's also for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be fair out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, not all medical conditions are
visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you got to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we, uh, we here in Colorado,
I'll assume that the CDPHE would be
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to add other conditions to the
list of currently accepted conditions over
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been countless applications at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember how many, but it's like
15 or 20.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, PTSD has been up three times and
they've denied everything just flat out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough research showing that
there is, you know, a general effect and
[SPEAKER_02]: there isn't research done because it's not
allowed yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not enough research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're looking for harm,
you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the research until very, very,
like within the last few months recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these studies are being drawn up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be conducted in the next year or
seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, you know, findings will be out and
become public knowledge 10 years from
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just going to keep letting
people suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I mean, at least in Colorado,
they can use the rec market or,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I mean, it's not like the black market
ever went away here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has had to step up its game
considerably to continue to compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the black market will never go,
decent options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once the vet has the bud here in
Colorado, it's illegal again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's no good here, but we didn't take a
step forward today and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah, we stayed, we stumbled over
our own dicks once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you guys include the PTSD
when you write your new medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my main point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the next time it comes up that
we're trying to vote on this, make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you support it because I fully think that
PTSD is a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, get registered to vote marijuana will
be on your ballot in the next two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not on the ballot in 2015 vote
anyway, and just practice that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be ready for 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it will then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked a little bit in the last
episode about, uh, the desire for Denver
[SPEAKER_01]: voters, uh, to want, uh, consumption in
some establishments where people are over
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 and they're not smoking inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, on where's the data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was July 9th.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis posted an update to that
article and it says Denver voters favor
[SPEAKER_01]: limited pot use in bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Denver marijuana poll,
a majority of voters in the city support
[SPEAKER_01]: an initiative that would allow limited pot
use, uh, no indoor smoking at businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, over 21 businesses such as bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been voted on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article was written by Ricardo Baca
from the cannabis staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may skip part of it because we just need
to get to the point here, but it says a
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of Denver voters support an
initiative that would allow limited social
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana consumption in businesses such
as bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to a poll commissioned by the
group behind the proposal, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: has learned exclusively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of read that weird, but I think you
got it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that wrote up the bill,
uh, paid for a poll and the poll says
[SPEAKER_02]: voters are going to support it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, their, their poll doesn't,
if you're, you're really into politics,
[SPEAKER_02]: their poll says that voters support it by
56%.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they add in the people that are totally
not going to vote because they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, sure, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would support that, but I'm not going to
go support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, but there's television on that
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So net, but, um, I don't, I hope it passes
in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: The need for this is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge, but the poll data does not look
favorable right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If more of us don't get politically
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that actually says the poll results
say only 56% of likely Denver voters
[SPEAKER_01]: either strongly support or somewhat
support the initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the democratic firm,
public policy polling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so 56% isn't a bold number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no, that's 6% away from losing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you really look at the polling
data, it's something like 30% are like
[SPEAKER_02]: gung ho about it in 26%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it says here, uh, for those against
the initiative, 31% strongly oppose and 9%
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat oppose it while 5% said they
weren't sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was an automated telephone poll and
it's got a margin of error of 3.9
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a telephone poll.
[SPEAKER_01]: People on the telephone will say that they
will do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause all they got to do is sit there and
press one for yes and two for no and three
[SPEAKER_01]: for English.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they had to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a lot of these people probably
won't come out and vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pollsters asked whether voters
would support allowing the consumption of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana at private venues in Denver,
provided that the owner of the venue
[SPEAKER_01]: permits the consumption access to the
venue is limited to individuals,
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 years of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of older and smoking marijuana indoors is
prohibited and any outdoor use is hidden
[SPEAKER_01]: from public view.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not that, but it's that of a
bill and it's fairly, sorry guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs and soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty fair bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you got to be outside and it's got to
be 25 feet from wherever public gather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm envisioning is a shit load of
roof deck, um, type establishments in
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver where they just, uh, there's a
couple of bars that were already doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you felt like being outside,
you couldn't smoke up there tobacco or
[SPEAKER_02]: usually the, um, the last time I was up
there, but, uh, now they're going to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana up there or at least 25 feet
away from the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in a little back courtyard,
that's all fenced off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several like Cervantes Cervantes
other side in Denver has got the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: little area for smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's that other place where we go
to?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of clubs up there that
have nice little outdoor areas that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be beautiful to smoke in which to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just let us do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they say that they're gathering 5,000
signatures to get the question on Denver's
[SPEAKER_01]: November ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, another one of the poll findings that
Denver residents by a four to one ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that alcohol causes more problems
in the city than marijuana and also favors
[SPEAKER_01]: their side of the contentious issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Denver voters have made it quite clear
that they support treating marijuana like
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol said Mason Tevert, a national pot
activist, and one of the primary authors
[SPEAKER_01]: behind Colorado's original cannabis
legalizing amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he says voters approved measures to,
uh, measures to the effect in 2001
[SPEAKER_01]: measures to the effect in 2005,
2006, 2007, and 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not surprising that we're
still seeing such strong support,
[SPEAKER_01]: even among a more conservative voting
population in an off year election.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are supporting it more
surprisingly than we had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: This good's a little surprising to people
who follow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I mean, I wish them the best of
luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I lived in Denver, they'd have my vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it says in the question that asked
respondents, if alcohol or marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: caused more problems in Denver,
55% said alcohol, 13% said marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: 26% said both, and 6% were not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're making it obvious here that
alcohol is the problem and cannabis is the
[SPEAKER_01]: peaceful way to gather and celebrate and
have a good time and relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the last paragraph of the article
says, uh, by more than four to one margin
[SPEAKER_01]: in Denver voters site alcohol over
marijuana as a bigger source of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: in the city said divert anyone who has
spent time in the Loto on a weekend
[SPEAKER_01]: evening or walk down Colfax Avenue on any
given day knows that alcohol contributes
[SPEAKER_01]: to far more problems and far more severe
problems than marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, which if you go out on almost any
major city, any big city on the weekends,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you, if you go to the bar,
where is that every downtown's got that
[SPEAKER_01]: one area where there's a nice congregation
of bars and everybody goes there and about
[SPEAKER_01]: one o'clock on Friday night at a one of
the bars erupts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big ass fight and half of the bar
spills out and they all punch this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: out of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cops come and a few people
get arrested and then you hear about it
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that doesn't happen at weed events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it does, we, we shun those people
from the community and they don't come
[SPEAKER_01]: back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a peaceful drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like alcohol is the problem for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if they, uh, should,
if they let us smoke at clubs and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go, I don't go to places cause I
don't drink alcohol and there's no reason
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can go take a few dads,
I'd be more likely to go to the shows at
[SPEAKER_01]: the local venues because even though it's
not my kind of music, I would go be social
[SPEAKER_01]: if I could go dab out and have fun there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not antisocial.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just sick of explaining that we
don't drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I w I do not want a beer,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, it's not because I'm better than
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cause I don't want to be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a drunken asshole when I drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want the hangover anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hangover is terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a hangover in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes time to vote,
you guys, I want everybody that listens to
[SPEAKER_01]: this show that lives in the 303 and the
seven two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I want you guys all to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got those right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of you have to go vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do legalize consumption in adult places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're staring at the dabs bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just noticed the turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since you're looking at the turpex
container, I've got a star that says dab
[SPEAKER_01]: review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the other day I went up to Colorado
Springs and I visited my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I visited the lovely damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also visited my good buddy hunt and I
saw Jordan and I saw the terpy boys and I
[SPEAKER_01]: also saw John Randall's junior and we all
had a good time and I took Danielle with
[SPEAKER_01]: me and we went up to the shop and I picked
up some turpex sour Durbin sativa and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got to say, bro, it is sativa as a mofo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get super dabbed out when I smoke this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at me like, well,
let's get a dab of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see the container buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herein lies the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit was so good that it only lasted
a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lasted one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really approved of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys can get your hands on the
sour Durbin at green and healthy cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: green and healthy wellness in Colorado
Springs, uh, from turpex, I would
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely recommend that turpex is doing
some amazing things down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the turpex crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me, uh, they hooked me up with a
white and a black extra extra large turpex
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am now styled out in turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm repping it hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get a dab for myself and then I'll
get a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you like these little tiny dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiny dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got stuff to do tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a dab for Mike and while Mike takes
that dab, I'm going to move ourselves into
[SPEAKER_01]: the next article here and we will read
some news to kill my Mike while I choke
[SPEAKER_01]: was your buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is muted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you hear all that echo that cuts out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are reaching how much time are we
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 20 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make this a little bit of a
longer episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the article says, this is also from
the cannabis and it was written by Jean
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnson of the associated press.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline is one year in $70 million in
pot taxes and other lessons from
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the sub headline, we get a headline
and a sub headline now in articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The internet is fucking up our heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 250 million in marijuana sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington still has room to grow as its
ninth largest grower says it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be so successful and unsuccessful
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article goes on to say Washington
launched its second in the nation legal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana market with just a handful of
stores selling high price pot to long
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year later, the state has about 160
shops open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot tax revenues have soared past
expectations and sales top $1.4 million
[SPEAKER_01]: per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making $1.4 million per day on
cannabis in Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also goes on to say, and who knows the
industry might even start making some
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Washington pot farmers, processors and
retailers have complained all year that
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy state and federal tax burdens along
with competition from an unregulated
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana market have made it
difficult for them to do business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least some relief is there as here
this month, uh, two new laws take effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to regulate and tax medical marijuana
and one to cut Washington's three level
[SPEAKER_01]: excise pot tax to a single 37% tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's higher than Colorado tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the big lesson between
Washington and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is that the free market applies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we see it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people that are,
um, that have been smoking marijuana here
[SPEAKER_02]: for 40, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only time they visit the stores is
for novelty or the occasional selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for the most part, they're still
buying marijuana where they used to,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's half the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it absolutely is in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taxes are so bad that almost none of
the locals are interested because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: taxing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like 75% or it's like 25% three
different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by the time it gets to the consumer
at grams, like 60 bucks and what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to pay that when you can just
go to the dude on the corner and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: for 12 or 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the article goes on to say,
despite some industry gripes and those
[SPEAKER_01]: tweaks to Washington's legal pot law,
marijuana, uh, which, uh, marijuana law,
[SPEAKER_01]: which voters passed in 2012 to legalize
marijuana for adults over 21 officials and
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization backers say the state's slow
and deliberate effort to regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana has been a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year after stores opened on July 8th,
2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a look at the state of legal weed
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the taxes, uh, Washington racked
up more than $250 million in marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: sales in the past year, roughly $62
million of which constitute marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: excise taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beyond the state's original
forecast of 36 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the state and local sales and
other shops, uh, other taxes are included,
[SPEAKER_01]: the total payday for the state and local
government tops $70 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the interesting number there is the 60
million excise tax in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the excise tax is what's supposed to
pay that $40 million for schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've already crushed in the first
five months of this year, last year's
[SPEAKER_02]: whole year total.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because the standalone production
markets only just now coming online.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the shops had to produce their own for
the longest time here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the infrastructure we
started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, that excise tax was
real small here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the huge difference between our
taxes and their taxes is by the time it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets to the shelf, that excise tax is
nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only 10 million of theirs was in sales
tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collected like 60, 40 or something like
that in just sales tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope when the nationwide legalization
happens, I hope all these crazy taxes are
[SPEAKER_01]: done away with or adjusted somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to, it's going to have to come
back down to reality or they won't matter
[SPEAKER_02]: so much because they're charging you 36%
tax on a $2 gram, um, which is entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: feasible, which, uh, from, um,
they're made, they're growing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Washington, they may grow more than
they're able to sell is something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: see possibly happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could go really dirty cheap pretty soon
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see how long we've been
recording and we might, yeah, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to read the rest of this article and then
we're going to save the, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one more article we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next sub headline in this article
says, isn't legal weed expensive in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes on to say a few growers
harvesting, um, uh, by the first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, let me read it again, because it's
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go with the few growers
harvesting by the time the first stores
[SPEAKER_01]: opened, the average price of a gram of
legal marijuana spiked to nearly $30 last
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, about three times the cost in
medical marijuana shops, where prices have
[SPEAKER_01]: been dropping as more weed gets harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Washington has harvested 13.5
tons of marijuana flower intended to be
[SPEAKER_01]: sold as bud, but stores have only sold
about 10 tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the excess can be turned into
marijuana extracts, such as oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the harvest has helped drive down the
prices to an average of about 1150 per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little bit right about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew too much and it's getting
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, that in addition to tourists
eager to visit the city's historic first
[SPEAKER_01]: legal pot shop, his clientele primarily
consists of customers in the 25 and older
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of an adult demographic,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says they have jobs and they can afford
to buy the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the next headline says, so what's
next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick Garza, director of Washington's
liquor board, a liquor control board soon
[SPEAKER_01]: to be renamed the liquor and cannabis
board says he's proud of Washington's
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts at a meeting, the top,
uh, at meeting the top priorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The justice department laid out when it
announced it would allow Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and other States to regulate
marijuana, keeping criminal organizations
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the industry, keeping the marijuana
in state and keeping pot away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it goes on to say the state adopted
background checks and financial
[SPEAKER_01]: investigations of pot license applicants
and capped the total amount of production
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to keep it in line with in-state
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: While public health advocates say they
wish the state had done more to stress the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential harms of pot to teens,
the state required strict packaging and
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling requirements to keep children
from getting into the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of set a little standard here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the products that appeal to kids
also remain banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: No marijuana, cotton candy, or gummy
bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so Claude, you can't get the sweet
stone bears up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything here is sold in the childproof
packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even the candy bars come in a pill
bottle, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like they look like what your
kids eat or it can be confused easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're well labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're well labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the article wraps up to say,
this isn't the first time people have gone
[SPEAKER_01]: to Oregon to buy something either because
it's cheaper or because they don't apply
[SPEAKER_01]: sales tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, we saw it for liquor and we see
it for tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're making a ton of money in
Washington and they may have grown too
[SPEAKER_01]: much cannabis, which is fine because
they're pushing down the prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do this one more article.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also from Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know guys, I'm in Colorado, but I like
to share the news from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says Washington cracking down on
unlicensed medical marijuana stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even have to read the whole
article here because that headline says it
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is by Martha Belial from the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope I said your last name right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said 15 unlicensed medical marijuana
shops in unincorporated King County are on
[SPEAKER_01]: notice that they are violating the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: King County prosecutor, Dan Sederberg and
Sheriff John something said Wednesday that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're cracking down on these stores
after Washington lawmakers amended
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative 502 to require licenses for all
pot shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The change in the law brought medical
marijuana into the state licensing and tax
[SPEAKER_01]: scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sederberg said the stores were notified by
mail this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they continue to operate as
unlicensed retail outlets for the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market, they'll face civil and criminal
ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these shops are not registered and
they're operating like medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the 15 stores that received the
notice include seven in the White Center
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood, two in Skyway and six in the
Eastern part of the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: Messages left at Northwest Cannabis Market
in Seattle and Military Road Holistic in
[SPEAKER_01]: Auburn were not immediately returned.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no answer at Pacific Coast
Natural Medicine in Seattle or the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution rent in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these people are not answering the
phones because they're scared shitless.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get raided probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking tax money from the state
and operating in locations that would
[SPEAKER_01]: never be approved by the LCB, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are blight on the neighborhoods they
inhibit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a matter of opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the federal government is watching
how Washington regulates the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the success of the law depends on how
well local jurisdictions deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: unlicensed retail stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to sending notifications to
the 15 stores, county officials have
[SPEAKER_01]: notified landlords that there is an
illegal business operating on the
[SPEAKER_01]: property, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means that if the stores continue to
operate illegally, the liquor and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: board can go in and seize all of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the civil options don't work,
they will consider criminal remedies,
[SPEAKER_01]: he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going in heavy handed on this,
he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're telling them the new scheme has to
be followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The days of the Wild Wild West are over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw this kind of happen in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happened in our city like three
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just some dude who was like,
yeah, I could do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just opened up a dispensary
essentially out of his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's been going on for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy also was accused of blasting
buds, making BHO out of the buds and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling those buds that he blasted back on
the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: He stood out like a sore thumb and got
turned in by people in the neighborhood or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys have storefronts with
advertising and they're advertising just
[SPEAKER_01]: like a normal store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're going to either have to
get raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they don't bring it to that because
this is what sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a state that allows you to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people like this don't follow the
rules and they fuck it up for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to have to go in there
and tell them to shut this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't, they're going to get
raided, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds will come in and take all of
their shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at this point in Colorado,
you just Googled the rules and then follow
[SPEAKER_02]: the path laid out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can have your marijuana store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just follow the rules and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can just put a sign in your front
yard and get yourself a white board and a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of jars and a cash register and go
to town out of your living room and wait
[SPEAKER_02]: for the cops to show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will show up and you'll be
charged with unlawful distribution of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be charged with possession of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a crime to do all that unless
you're a dispensary owner.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we've been going 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough news for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike, thanks for coming over,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to wrap it up pretty quickly
because Mike's got somewhere to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have on the list here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of questions from
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to save those for another
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to remind you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature's green remedies dot com has
changed their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature's green remedies dot com has a new
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out the dank team dot
com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dank team dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a coupon code for you yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still rebuilding the website,
getting everything going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check out the dank team
dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Yankee?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening to this one,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everything's going well for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you guys follow me on
Periscope, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been on Periscope quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My account is just Rasta Jeff on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the news you guys have been hearing,
not all of it, but a good portion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: news that I've been bringing to you guys
has been getting tweeted to me from Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Mike, thanks for sending me all the
news, giving us content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing two shows a week because
you've got so much news content for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to keep the people informed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like prohibition was, it was just
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no one questioned it when we were
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that dam is breaking and if more
people start getting active and more
[SPEAKER_02]: people are informed, we're going to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so fucking close.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're almost, the 50-50 line is
almost crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are almost more legal states than
illegal states now, which is when that
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses, I think that's when something
will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We broke the population 50-50 line
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the numerical state number now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 100 East Coast states with
like eight people in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they're the size of Denver.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I want to not
forget to give shout outs to Mark Dank,
[SPEAKER_01]: Reve and Arnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, happy birthday to my cousin,
Brandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you listen to this show,
but Brandy, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're having a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes out on July 16th.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is her birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are smoking a bowl,
if you're taking a dab, blowing up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air for my cousin, Brandy right now,
she was one of my best friends growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like my little sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy birthday, girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm going to talk about one more
thing and then we're going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, there's a guy on Instagram who calls
himself Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude sent me this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only had it set up for a day now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a lot of time to play with
it, but the time I have had to play with
[SPEAKER_01]: it, I really fucking enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude makes custom coffee tables,
end tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes bookcases.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes shelves, but he installs an
e-nail in your table for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have now got a coffee table with two
e-nail coils coming out of the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two rigs sitting on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those nails are hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can walk over there and Mike and I can
take a dab side by side and choke
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday, I took a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two friends that are a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're together and they came over and I
told them, go take a dab together,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they got to go do a couple dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he painted the iRegenetics Colorado
logo on the tabletop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a three foot long by, I think that's
about two feet wide coffee table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little shelf on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's super sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The e-nails work, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot complain about those e-nails at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's spectacular looking folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked in and was like, bro,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?
[SPEAKER_02]: He just smiled big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to demo it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, really give it a trial and
then we'll do a real review.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks, at this point I can say it
looks just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far it has worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken several dabs out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been dabbing out of it since
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: He watched me unbox it on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually was on, I did a Periscope
video when it got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I unboxed it and set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bobo got to watch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, big shout out to Bobo Blaster
Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check him out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making furniture with an e-nail built
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know what that is,
you just got to go check out either his
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram or his website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's burniture, like the word furniture
with a B, burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Big Cartel is just like a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an Etsy or an eBay or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a retail sales site where
anybody can set up their own store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check out burniture
