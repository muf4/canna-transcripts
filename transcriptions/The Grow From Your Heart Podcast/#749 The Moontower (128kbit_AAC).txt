[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what I got to do this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the museum and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
if you are cannabis consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like to go see cool shit,
get blazed and go to the museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Museum of Natural Art and
Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Museum of Art and Science, some shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking rad, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get blazed and go see some really great
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommendation for the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I want to focus on talking about
the main topic of the podcast which is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my new strains called the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know that I am a podcaster
but many people may not know that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: also a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the head breeder, the sole proprietor
for iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make great regular and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not make auto flowers but we are
doing a collab with a friend at Night Owl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I have recently been
releasing that went through testing that
[SPEAKER_00]: is now being released to the public is
something called the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the Moon Tower?
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents of the Moon Tower are a pre-98
Bubba Kush female pollinated by my Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: male who is also known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll focus a little bit on Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will move deeply into talking
about the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pre-98 Bubba Kush, the female plant
that makes up this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've loved that plant for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since medical cannabis got popular,
I've been buying Bubba Kush, pre-98 Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush from dispensaries, from friends,
from any type of grower I can find it from
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the clone a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get clones, sometimes I work with
them, I breed to them, then I let them go
[SPEAKER_00]: or I grow them for my own personal
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm limited to so many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I'll just let things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, I've gotten my hands on
Bubba several times and I've let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved the coffee flavors,
the earthy, the dirty kind of notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: tones and flavors and aromas that it
creates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a really nice heavy-eyed buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of strains now that I smoke give me
like an open bug-eyed kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bubba Kush makes my eyes a little bit
heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me a little bit lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my shoulders kind of relax a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me sit back in the chair instead
of the edge of the chair, which is where I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the Bubba Kush because it's got
that kind of couch-lock feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost sits me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a hyperactive dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by the way I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking a million miles an hour right
here under the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I go super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke the Bubba Kush, it will chill
me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for nighttime smoke for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for if I'm hanging out with the
lady and I'm too talkative and she wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to watch a movie, smoke that Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll calm me right down, get into the
mode for a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got to do some emails or some work
and I'm too hyper, that will chill me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the Bubba Kush, that couch-lock
relaxation plus the coffee, the dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: the earthy tones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a problem with the way it
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like a Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows a little bit stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be better, but there's not a huge
problem with the way that it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon, again, is an F1 male.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1, let's say that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon is an Arise F1 male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I crossed the Golden Goat and
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Golden Goat female, a Daybreaker
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that Daybreaker male pollen on the
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that first batch of seeds,
I found a dude that is, he's a stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's proven himself to be a winner because
I've crossed him to hundreds of females,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say at least a hundred females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown probably 70 of them or
somebody's grown 70 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all probably say 60 to 65 of them
were quite stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do perform quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So King Solomon is a stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few that don't work super
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those won't be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them aren't amazing, but that's
not the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I breed with King Solomon,
I know that he is going to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that I put his pollen on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will make things more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will make things grow with more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems to be the improver or the fixer
plant is what I know him as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, he is a Golden Goat female
pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about Daybreaker
because that will come into play here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is a Chem D to Joseph OG cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that Chem dog, the Chem D,
that like cushy chemical sort of a smell
[SPEAKER_00]: over here and Joseph OG, which is like
swampy, just cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what Cush smells like,
it's straight up Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what Cush smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got Joseph, you got Chem,
and then they cross that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put that to the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gave us kind of a sweet,
cushy Chem, dirty feet, sweet feet sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody took the Chem D and crossed it
to the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the Daybreaker male, pollinated the
Golden Goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made sort of a tropical fruit,
sweet, cushy, dirty feet, aroma sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were labeled Arise from that
batch of seeds was a male who has been
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows with those sweet chemi flavors,
aromas, hyper vigor, super potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's also resistant to problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can handle a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why did I want to cross these two
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say when you're breeding, have a goal,
have something in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the thing that really got me
excited about this was these are two of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved the Bubba Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a favorite of mine for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, he's done a lot of great work
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an opportunity to put them both in
the same area and breed to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, why would I miss this
opportunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as I was doing it, I thought,
what am I going to create here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I wanted to create that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to keep the coffee and earth
flavor, add some sweetener to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit of sweetness to it,
but then try to hype up the growth time
[SPEAKER_00]: because the Arise grows super quickly to
where it cuts down the veg time with some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I breed it to things, it veges more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping to make the Bubba Cush veg
more quickly and keep that sweet Cush
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, add a little sweetness to it at
the same time, add a little bit of potency
[SPEAKER_00]: was honestly my main goal, the main idea
when making this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results actually were, I wrote this
down, coffee, earth, fuel, and funk
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get medium height plants with
tight internodal spacing and long lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the plants, in my opinion,
in my experience, what I've seen from
[SPEAKER_00]: testers is the plants, they'll grow kind
of tall, but the internodal spacing will
[SPEAKER_00]: be tight together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those branches that come from those
nodes get really, really long is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got medium height plants with
tight internodal spacing and long lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're kind of talking about how it
grows and its growth structures and
[SPEAKER_00]: features.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moved on from that flavor and aroma
profile, talking more about the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: features.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't top these plants,
or yeah, if you don't top them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will make one giant cola,
they'll make one big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a lot of branching coming up,
it'll make a lot of nice side buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you'll get one big donkey dick
bud right up the middle if you don't top
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do top it, it'll make it spread
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend topping low.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people top when there's that one
V section that's only a few inches apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go down one or two more nodes lower,
top it there, veg a little bit longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it recover, let it kind of even out a
little bit, then you'll get a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: from it, in my experience with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take off, they stretch early and
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes will double in height
before they are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of phenotypes have the potential to
become double in height before they are
[SPEAKER_00]: done flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a two-foot flowering
space, flower at a foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow for pot space, allow for light
space, but you understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flower at 12 inches, they will
finish at 24 inches, so be prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do take off and stretch a little bit
and early flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I recommend you be
prepared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing the moon tower,
it will get stretchy for you early in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those phenotypes are going to get
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about how to take care of that
here in just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some notes I should try to stay
on track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see some of the phenotypes that I'm
experiencing and that test growers have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen through the populations of moon
tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a structure, the same structure
across most of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same shape, the same structure
that is happening in most environments and
[SPEAKER_00]: from most phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tall and they've got that long
branchy structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main differences I'm seeing,
the main difference in structure that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing is depending on your light,
depending on your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are getting different stretch space
in that inner node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of light,
if you pack the plants in too closely,
[SPEAKER_00]: also if you put them in too small of a pot
and they get root bound, they do get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when all things are good, when the
lights, the air, water, soil, the spacing
[SPEAKER_00]: is all correct, they do stay pretty squat,
not squat, they stay tight, not squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tight is the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: The node spacing is tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one tall structure is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get long branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The long branches, however, do fill in
with giant colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also need support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend a support for the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave it there, a lot of people are
going to cut it out, but I do recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: supports for the taller branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a trellis net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trellis makes it super easy for me to do
what I like to do in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you like to move the plants
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may recommend sticks, but be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sticks will get in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a tomato cage is better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ways to do that,
but a trellis net is my ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I use three nets of trellis in a
commercial environment so the plants start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they start growing toward that
trellis, I'll top them and then spread
[SPEAKER_00]: them out, let them grow into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a little bit taller up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll spread them out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That third one is just to guide those buds
straight up to the sky to where they know
[SPEAKER_00]: where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I defoliate everything below that
first net of trellis, three layers in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main things you guys will see in my
experience of differences in phenotypes is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be leaf shape and bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the most obvious visual
determination of different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That skinnier leaf phenome, in my opinion,
is like kush and coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I was breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that kush, earthy coffee flavor,
but then it's also got that kush buzz that
[SPEAKER_00]: like sits you down, chills you out,
but then there's also something in it
[SPEAKER_00]: that's got some caffeine or some energy to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'd like to sit here and fuck
around, but I got to go do something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm so high, I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of gives me that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, it may drive you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some motivation to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some kick and some arise
intensity to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kush buzz comes through most of the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get that kushy feeling
that like chilled out, relaxed sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that's going to come through most
of the phenotypes, those skinnier leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, however, are going to have a
little bit of a head ring to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly a little bit of a caffeinated
feeling to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does come from the golden goat side
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the bud structure on some will be
tighter than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the less dense phenotypes
are excellent for concentrate makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that super tight bud,
I think you can make a better concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the dense buds are great for bag
appeal and smoking, but extracting,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, my experience from what my
friends tell me, extracting a less dense
[SPEAKER_00]: product is easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more room for trichomes on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got like a bud that's kind of
airy, kind of fingery, imagine if we took
[SPEAKER_00]: a kush nugget that's super tight and like
a haze nugget that's got fingers and we
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled them both around in powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing my hands to the camera for
everybody that's listening on Spotify or
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at my two hands, I got a fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much I can cover my fist, the outer of
my fist with powdered sugar if I'm sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I open up my hand, I got the inside of
my hand between my fingers, all of this I
[SPEAKER_00]: can coat in powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or trichomes if that were a nugget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe sometimes if you're growing
for concentrate, sometimes those more
[SPEAKER_00]: airy, fingery buds are good for the
concentrate making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tighter buds obviously are more
kush leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those come from more of the kush chem side
of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more fingery buds are more from the
golden goat, the Romulan, the Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa side of the genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be more of the head
ringer, the head buzz, the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell are my keys while I'm
driving my car?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are my sunglasses while they're on
my face?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my phone while I'm playing on
Instagram, that kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those come from the skinnier leaf shape
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feeling is going to come from those
long, skinny leaves and kind of even the
[SPEAKER_00]: more airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the longer and skinnier the leaf,
the more airy the bud, of course the more
[SPEAKER_00]: head ringer of a buzz I believe you're
going to get from those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use that leaf shape, use that leaf,
that bud density to help you determine
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of which phenotype that you have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, the most important
part when it comes to phenotype selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about which phenotypes you
will see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, you're going to see one
with long, skinny leaves, one with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit wider leaf, one with tight,
tight buds, one that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: fluffier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get different combos
of those buds and leaves together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't matter to me which
phenotype you find.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound rude, as long as you find
the one that works the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've described a lot of phenotypes and
then people email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, how do I find the phenotype
that you call the mean girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I find the phenotype that you
called the fat girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I find that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, just grow it and honestly look
for the best phenotype in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have the one that I like
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like weed that makes me fucking panic
attack while I'm sitting at a table by
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just freak myself out by taking
a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh shit, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might not be for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to smoke and lay down and
take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find the phenotype that does the thing
that you need done from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that grows the best in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have it for nine weeks in
flower, four-ish, six-ish weeks in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with this plant for fucking
15, 16, 20 weeks, 120 days-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's something you want to grow
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, find the phenotype that is something
you want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're selling it or profiting from
it or using it as medicine, make sure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that works for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choose the one that works for you in
your environment, for your wallet,
[SPEAKER_00]: for your budget, for your clientele,
whatever you need it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a totally different phenotype
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about making money off of
the flowers I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to smoke all of them,
or I'm going to pollinate them and make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my grow and your grow are focused on
two totally different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype that works the best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to go back talking about
phenotypes because there is one anomaly
[SPEAKER_00]: out of, I talk about most of them are
going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have that long branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have tight internotal spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one, however, that just loves to
fuck with you because that's how genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: work, that is a short, squat, runt-looking
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like it's going to be any
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you finish that plant out and
flower it and let it go its full 67,
[SPEAKER_00]: 72-ish day term that it needs to go,
that plant will punch you in the face like
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like cinder blocks to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like cement shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I don't know, it's like some
sort of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will put you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit will just lay you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such good medicine, but you don't
get a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like dirty ass skunks and it
takes you two hits to go full retard from
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it, but you don't get a lot of it
and it doesn't look super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing it just for yourself,
if you just want to smoke it for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little shitty runt plant that
may pop up in a pack of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found it like two or three times out
of a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of the testers have reported it,
but if you get that one, finish it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get a clone because it stays
so little.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to veg it for a real long time and
treat it like a baby, but the medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from that, the buds from that,
it is worth the extra effort and the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to sell it, if you're
doing a commercial grow, that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's for your bag, for your head,
for your jar, grow that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got it just over there in the
corner of the room, finish that bad bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: out because it is worth it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just grow it at the one time,
see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've talked about the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about terps, flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked a lot about the feelings and
buzz that this plant gives me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a few of the grow
features and tips that I can give you for
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that the moon tower works
very good in a screen of green
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you trellis them down with the net,
they enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also work well in a sea of green
environment because they grow that one big
[SPEAKER_00]: tall apical dominant cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you veg them until they're,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight, 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you veg them to about 10 inches tall,
cut off all the bottom branching and flip
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just end up with a bunch of nice
main colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run a lot of them real close
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're going to do that
method, don't expect a huge harvest from
[SPEAKER_00]: each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we do a sea of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you do like 64 of them on a
three by three table and eight by eight
[SPEAKER_00]: square on a three by three table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a state where your numbers
are regulated, that is not the way to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the plants will enjoy doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend with the moon tower,
cleaning up the branches, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: completely removing the entire branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of leg shaving, a lot of
cleaning up of the bottom of the plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: my school of thought, in my training camp,
in my facilities, in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I wouldn't cut off all of the
branching at the bottom of the moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may leave more branching than usual and
instead of cutting that off, I would kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of strip the bottom half or two thirds of
that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean that right up toward the bottom
is naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their legs for a far way up,
but when you get up to the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: skirt, you're just going to grow big long
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave a nice section up at the top and
have a naked tip or a naked leg,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice tip, and that'll grow nice big donkey
buds at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean it up and then leave the end of
it enough at the end to make you a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: fat cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that space should fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, a Kush plant is going to make a
bunch of golf balls, but what the Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: has done, the Arise makes that bud stack
up a little bit better and fill in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should mention,
don't overwater the moon tower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like being overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may survive better if you underwater
them than they would if you overwater
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do eat moderately heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are used to feeding a plant a
certain diet, maybe step it up just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the things
you may want to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do love the cow mag and when you feed
a cow mag, it makes the leaves kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: the serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pop up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love that and they look super good
for photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants do like a low pH toward the end
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will increase your colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, help you for photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low temps at night will help your photos,
make it change a little bit of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tolerate that cold quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do like kelp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp products will help your flavors,
aromas, and bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I noticed, they responded very
well to a product called Bud Swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fed them Bud Swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They swole up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to mention, these plants
do have a tendency to just go yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: around week eight, right around the end of
week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 56, day 59, day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to go wonk and turn
yellow on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a sign of, hey, we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't started flushing,
if you do that, now it may be time to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the 18.6 light switch,
now it may be time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey bro, we're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to go ahead and start wrapping
it up, get ready for harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they turn yellow, that is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you did anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a common issue that happens with
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even guess it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a trait that happens within
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, hey bro, time to cut us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will just turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the big leaves will fall right off
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start pre-trimming themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten that report from a lot of test
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it amongst a lot of phenotypes
that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just letting you know that it
is almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for their haircut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scrolling through my notes to see
where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did like the Budswell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that they liked Budswell a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really seem to take well that
Budswell, that organic bat guano liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient made them swell up, made them get
super beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched them swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a couple of batches of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen other people grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that did not use Budswell did not
get the swell that I saw my plants get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these plants can be challenging to
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why they don't like to clone
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-98 Bubba Kush clones well.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon clones well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the problematic cloning
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've discovered, what I've learned to
realize is if you don't feed these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for three to four days, they will clone
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're gonna take clones of the
moon tower, make sure the mother plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: been starved for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is common amongst most cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overfeed them nitrogen,
if they're high in nitrogen, when you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, it does slow down the rooting
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make them a little bit hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will speed up your rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They root well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get kind of tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be your main thing to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to be prepared for tall
plants, but they should be fairly easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: most growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't experience too much
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't get too much trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeder a moderately high nitrogen diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you feed your plants, however many
PPMs of nitrogen now, maybe increase that
[SPEAKER_00]: by 10, 20% and pay attention to these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are hungry bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tell you to superfeed it
because then you're gonna go pounding it
[SPEAKER_00]: with too much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something I would recommend that
you do consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all recommendation from a friend
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider when you flip to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go from your veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn your lights to 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one starts when you flip the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people will now switch from their
vegetative to their flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, I would recommend you go two
more weeks with your vegetative nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: with this strain because these plants do
eat a lot of nitrogen and they will need
[SPEAKER_00]: that extra nitrogen built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help you out in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works for a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe taper off that veg feed into your
bloom feed over the next two week period,
[SPEAKER_00]: but adjust that slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just drop off that nitrogen
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you will see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon tower does enjoy moderate
defoliation, but don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to defoliate plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned that if you over defoliate
the moon tower, she will get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: pissy with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of doing one fat defoliation over
a couple of weeks, do a couple of light
[SPEAKER_00]: defaults.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually suggest popping and twisting
these plants to build structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I recommend on most of
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few cultivars that don't react
well to it, but the moon tower responds
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what I'm talking about,
I've done a full episode on popping and
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically grab the plant with two hands
and give it a twist in different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions, and it goes like popping a
knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the plant break the cellulose
fiber right there, and it will rebuild a
[SPEAKER_00]: little knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little bit knurled might be the
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also slows down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make it stronger right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can support itself a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: More nutrients can flow through a thicker
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that will slow down the vertical
stretch, so they're not growing as quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: through that phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will slow that down and make them
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I think really helps with these
plants is keep the pH consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to like that consistent pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH swings, pH jumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little bit out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, medium does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really will like consistent pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before, they like Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really enjoy kelp, and these plants
responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week six, we hit them with a bud swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went fucking kaboom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit them with that bud swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd want to remind you, don't panic if
they turn yellow close to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just dying, but they're still
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the buds going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut off the leaves anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest of these plants will generally be
ready around day 63 to day 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend going long for your
first couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you when I hit them with a bud
swell, they really swelled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you let them go 74, 75 days,
they really might beef up at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend, though, at least 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 63, 70 days is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get outliers, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be 60-day finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that if you've got the right
setup for the moon tower, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fat harvest from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you clean up the bottom of her,
give her that attention she deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there's no junk on the bottom,
no larf, none of that fluffy stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of that wasted buds, none of those
mini shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean all that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send all that energy up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get plenty of light down into the canopy
with a good light, with the proper care,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the right airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I predict that you could get pretty fat
harvest from the moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to set expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say if you do it right and
you put in the work, a new grower can get
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty harvest from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to take a moment to give a shout
out to my friend Lefty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was throwing around a strain name ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to name strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cool shit has taken all the things
in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I come up with it, I feel like
I telegraph it out to other people and
[SPEAKER_00]: they take the strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've had a bunch of cool names in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan if you've been listening
this far, now is the time that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to reveal how the strain got named.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of the movie Dazed and
Confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to name stuff after Dazed and
Confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Lefty's got a strain known as
Wooderson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Banana Kush to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had Moon Tower written on a strain
name list for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a document on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I watch a movie or whatever,
I get a strain name idea, type it down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when new strains come up,
we scroll through and see if anything
[SPEAKER_00]: matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works out in my head, Moon Tower was
on the list for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what do we name the Bubba Kush to
Arise?
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Lefty said the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I just saw that movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just watched it with my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's from Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I introduced her to that movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: She laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lefty said Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked about Banana Kush to Arise a
moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from the movie Dazed and Confused,
The Party at the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came out right around the time that I
was partying at the Moon Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really at the Moon Tower, but you get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Lefty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lefty, bro, I hope you and the wife are
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're killing it down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the good work that you do
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job with those testers, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did so good.
