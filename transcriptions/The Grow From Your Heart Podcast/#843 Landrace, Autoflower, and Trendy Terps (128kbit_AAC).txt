[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 843 of the Grow From Your
Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got another great show
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out and we'll talk more about those
free seeds later on in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far in today's episode,
I do want to remind you that the 4th of
[SPEAKER_00]: July is approaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the 4th of July approaches in my
neighborhood, we play a fun game known as
[SPEAKER_00]: gunshots or fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hear weird noises in the
background, place your bets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be gunshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to take a moment to thank
everybody for the support on the IREDirect
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory blowout sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last half of last month,
I put all of the seeds on sale on
[SPEAKER_00]: IREDirect and you guys helped me clean out
that inventory so I did not have to count
[SPEAKER_00]: so many packs for the inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it a lot easier to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, as you're watching this
podcast, there is a full restock on
[SPEAKER_00]: IREDirect.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: Freebies?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean freebies?

[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers all of the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's favorite new part of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pet peeve portion of today's
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most of you out there know what a
pet peeve is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pet peeve is something that just drives
you crazy, that just grinds your gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes when I am in a grow room
situation or looking at a grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: online, I will see major pet peeves,
something that just drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do encourage you to send me your grow
room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email them to me at grow from your
heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do read your grow room pet peeve here
on the podcast, I will send you a coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: code for a free pack of seeds at
ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's pet peeve came from our friend who
wants to be called Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, my dude Sweet?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pet peeve goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my pet peeve, my brother,
tastes trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruity is the trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas is the trend and sour is all the
trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says all I want is great
flower and great genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate all of these flavor trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I may disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will delve more into that as this
message unfolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I hate the trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he says a different word, but I'm
going to say fruit because we're early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get censored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I don't give a fruit if it's
fruity, piney, pissy, gassy, spicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: or woody, as long as it's killer product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want specific buzzes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I hunt for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's where we're going to kind of
delve into this in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the buzz I'm looking for comes in pine,
well then it's going to be pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the great flavors like the rest,
but if I can find no ceiling, shoot you to
[SPEAKER_00]: the moon weed, I don't give a crap if it's
a trendy strain or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you didn't know what you
were going to get and that was another
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the excitement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I remember those days when you didn't
know what you were going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just went to the dude's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got what the dude had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He paid him money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were excited just to have something to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a whole new era of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this is medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are smoking and consuming cannabis
for medical needs and they need specific
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of that does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that as this,
like I said, as this does unfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do agree just getting what you used
to get was part of the excitement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now part of the excitement for me is
going to sometimes it's my friend's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's the DGC cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really buy flowers from
dispensaries, but I will stop in for
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates because I can't make the
concentrates that I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep up with green dot to be quite
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that variety that's on the shelf at
the dispensary, that green dot,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go see all those different jars and
I've got that variety and I know they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all very good and very consumable,
that puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to the DGC cup and I see that
Hot Rod's got his flower on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hobbit's got his flower on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps has his flower on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soda's got his amazing lemon Jeffrey on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can look at all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that variety puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a whole new era of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to just take what the dude's
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it tastes like cat piss and I'm not in
a cat piss, I can smoke the other one that
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like strawberries, which we're
going to talk more about all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me finish your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, enough of my rant, brother Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, don't worry, bro, because I'm going
to rant on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you've won a coupon code for a
free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you do check your email,
check your spam because there's a gift in
[SPEAKER_00]: there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I want to leave you with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all your hard work,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that hard work, I get to
benefit with some killer smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what I crave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro, from your friend Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that my hard work is leading to
your hard work and our hard work is paying
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some killer smoke,
which is what we crave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brando, bro, it's what plants crave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a lot of things to unpack in
here as I've mentioned a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start by saying you want specific
buzzes and that's what you hunt for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care if it comes in pine and
then you didn't list other flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I have found through my research,
through my experience, I think through
[SPEAKER_00]: reading and through science as well,
they could probably back me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those buzzes come along with a
very specific flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the terpenes that are providing
the flavor and also contributing to your
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the analogy that I'm going to
use to explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, I have no degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any education on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I figured out through
reading, through studying, through my own
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I've come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC or the chosen cannabinoid in the
product which you are smoking is what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you go high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's compare that to a firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say if you pack this firework
with THC, the more THC you put in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher into the sky that firework is
going to go, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your rocket fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your gunpowder will say you're going to
stuff that into this firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to light it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got 50% THC, we're getting 50% up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got 89% THC, we're going 89% way up
in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I really think strongly the terpenes
are, and there are other parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: other components to this that can play
into this equation here, but we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are esters, palliates, flavonoids,
other things in this same category,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to focus on terps just to
keep it specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes, when this firework goes up
in the sky, that's you getting high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the terpenes in my experience,
in my opinion, in my theory, those are
[SPEAKER_00]: what give you the color to the firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the different colors in that
firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we pack in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different chemicals and
fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it, but they're going to be
different terps in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those terpenes are what affect my high in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get high from the THC,
but now am I going to get paranoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get the giggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get the munchies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get confused?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get tunnel vision?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get horny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get a headache?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is my headache going to go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is my blood pressure going to raise or is
my blood pressure going to drop?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different things I can
get from different cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of that is from the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is from the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, I don't care about specific
flavors, but I bet if you started paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention from this point forward,
you'll notice that certain flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas give you different buzzes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you don't care what the trend
is, but it does really matter what the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode long, long ago that is
called Follow Your Nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be before I was even doing video
podcasts, but it was called Follow Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Nose because I believe that your nose
knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go wherever you're going to buy
your cannabis, if it's to your own
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of jars or to a dispensary or to
your buddy, if you go to that dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and you open 10 jars, five of them,
you're going to go, nah, not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an experienced, if you're not
just excited about it, they do all smell
[SPEAKER_00]: good, but out of those 10 jars,
maybe there's two of them that really jump
[SPEAKER_00]: out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there's something to do with the
way those terpenes are talking to your
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is another analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll compare all of this to this is why
poop is brown and stinks and why oranges
[SPEAKER_00]: are bright orange and taste good and are
good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poop stinks because we're not supposed
to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nature's little hint of saying,
hey, bro, don't eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, don't do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're a gross dog or something,
most people aren't going to want to eat a
[SPEAKER_00]: poop unless there's something deeply wrong
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, oranges are bright
orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in nature and you're walking
around, you see an orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something inside of your brain can
taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting the juicy flavor in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to climb over there and get that
orange and eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the orange tastes good and looks
appealing visually for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature gave us those signals on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that the terpenes in our
flowers and our ganja and our cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: our concentrates, they're that way for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It draws us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't even know there was a
reason why you needed that lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's the one you smoked and it
fixed so many things you weren't even
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of internally or biologically that
you weren't even thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it has put you in the mood that
you needed to be in because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it works perfectly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do bet that if you did some study and
some paying attention, you would notice
[SPEAKER_00]: that certain buzzes come from certain
terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice most of the time, lemony stuff
puts a good smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey, lemon diesel, lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all got a good smiley, uplifting,
like, hey, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the GMO, Han Solo burger,
that stuff, the what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The garlic banger from Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts me like heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pushes me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff has a a garlicky,
nasty, trash can fermented sort of a turp
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of a heavier, the opposite end of the
lemons and they have opposite completely
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite buzzes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can notice that in the buzz when I
smoke those different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pay more attention to my notes
because I've got a lot of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually on a podcast with other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the Dude Grow
Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a breeder's panel and we had
several breeders talking about what we
[SPEAKER_00]: like and what the market likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, flavors and
aroma were always in breeders top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any breeder, we went through the panel and
we're like, what matters most to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And flavor and aroma in the smokable
product is definitely in the top three for
[SPEAKER_00]: every breeder on the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I wrote down that these trends,
this is where I do agree with this pet
[SPEAKER_00]: peeve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my old man pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jump in with you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get on your lawn with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, when people say I got that gas,
if you tell me you got gas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show up and your weed smells like
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say I got that gas, that's because
your weed smells like gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you call it gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people have just taken the word
gas and applied it to any weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ain't real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's false advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like walking around with whoppers
in your pocket and talking about you got
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Macs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some good cheeseburgers,
but you definitely don't have Big Macs,
[SPEAKER_00]: my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't your way right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my part of this pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you call it gas, that shit better be
gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say I got the fruit and it smells
fruity, I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you call it gas and it smells like
fucking blueberries or cookies or...
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not gas, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop doing that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me regroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps will predict the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that the trends are silly,
but I bet you that if you pay attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those trends will lead you in a
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nose always knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow your nose because I think your nose
knows what turps your body needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All turps matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to call it the gas,
show up with that gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the pet peeve section of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure once again that you do check
your inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that spam because you've got a
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since this episode does come out
right before the start of the month,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does give me a good opportunity to make
a public service announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do receive a coupon code,
a gift code for free seeds on ireadirect
[SPEAKER_00]: .com from the show, those do come with
expiration dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those expiration dates are clearly printed
on the email that you do receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those expiration dates are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will expire on that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do encourage you to redeem those gift
certificates, those coupon codes as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to have an expiration date on
those coupon codes because I can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: have free seeds floating out there
forever, just have money on the books
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to close those tabs at some
point just for logistics and bookkeeping
[SPEAKER_00]: and business reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So help me help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do get those coupon codes,
please redeem those as quickly as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: because if they expire, I cannot help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot reactivate that coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to give you guys about 30 days since
it's here at the start of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody getting these, your coupon
codes, coupon code will expire at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of July if you're getting them in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you about a month,
but I do encourage you to please use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them expire and use them as
quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I got that public service
announcement over, let's work our way into
[SPEAKER_00]: the question and answer portion of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website is ireagenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab, you can send me
a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your grow question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question on today's episode came
from our new friend, Stefan, and it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, dear Rasta Jeff, I hope you're
doing well and thanks for sharing your
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I am doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are great wherever you are,
whenever you hear this and you are very
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome for sharing the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've got some general questions
regarding land races when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to enjoy this, but before I
answer it, let me give a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not much of a land race grower or
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land race growers and breeders are
kind of a special niche group when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are growers, there are smokers,
there are growers, there are breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then somewhere in that little
in-between area, I'm not saying there are
[SPEAKER_00]: less or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just their own little,
they've got their own little sect,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own little niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the land race growers and
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also off to the side, same little
category, different category, same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sect is the autoflower group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just smaller branches of a big group,
just smaller branches that have branched
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still part of our team,
but they're doing a very specific thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not in that land race group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also not in the autoflower group,
but I can talk enough about it to sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like I know what I'm talking about and I
can definitely answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's start this off by talking about
what a land race is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people out there may not understand
what land race genetics are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question may not make much sense to a
lot of people, so let's lay the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about what land race genetics means.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a land race?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, in my research,
a land race is basically a strain that is
[SPEAKER_00]: developed naturally, regionally,
and not interrupted by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say there's a mountain
somewhere in Nepal that nobody has visited
[SPEAKER_00]: for a very long time, hundreds of years
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's been to this mountainside in
Nepal, but the people in Nepal that live
[SPEAKER_00]: there, they have been breeding and growing
the same cultivar for that hundred of
[SPEAKER_00]: years that nobody has been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hundred years worth of breeding,
but no other genetics have been
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred years ago, there was a crop,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It all pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't pull the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't pull the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they don't pull the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds fall into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say a hundred years ago,
that was an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just gonna start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows how long ago it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was walking on a trail at some
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dropped two seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a boy and a girl that made more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there was F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it did it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done it for a hundred years
uninterrupted, growing, pollinating
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, falling to the ground and starting
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the people in these regions may be
collecting these flowers, these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be making hash or doing something
with it, but the breeding is being
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted, unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are two things that could be
happening here and I think both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: would fall into a land race here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of open pollination
happening for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males and females are grown amongst each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the males pollinate all the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got all kinds of different
genetic opportunities in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the genetics will be in that
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get enough seeds, you'll find
everything possible within every mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: every female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males pollinate the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drop the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps happening year after year after
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my other school of thought is that
some of these farmers may be selectively
[SPEAKER_00]: culling males and females from the crops
that don't meet their standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they can visually see that one
doesn't put out the hash that I need or
[SPEAKER_00]: the fiber that I need or that male doesn't
make the females that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he can visually see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he may be removing candidates from the
breeding pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the land race genetics folks out
there, I don't know how they feel about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's within the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I gave the disclaimer before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a land race breeding person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the things that are most
likely to happen in those unpopulated
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, those beautiful regions on the
planet that we haven't destroyed and built
[SPEAKER_00]: concrete all over everything and put the
internet everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are mountain sides of just endless
cannabis plants that are untouched by
[SPEAKER_00]: people or maybe slightly touched by
people, but they are not adulterated by
[SPEAKER_00]: other genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are land race genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the long description that I said
was going to be short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me jump into the next part of
this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, how important are land race
genetics for you and your breeding work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the quick answer for that one is for
me, they are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the point where I am in my breeding,
I've made enough things where I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to acquire any more plants or seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying I don't want to,
but I could stop any incoming plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and I could breed for a hundred
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could breed for the rest of my life with
the seed and breeding stock I've already
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, those land races don't
excite me, don't interest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely understand where they come
from, what they are, how they are working
[SPEAKER_00]: in my current crosses and what I can see
the traits from around the world and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can identify different things from those
land races and how they are playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: my current breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now at this time, those plants
don't interest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not on my radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if there were an apocalypse and we
had to start over or maybe if I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: start over, if I bred all my stuff into
some bottleneck where it all started
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out to be lemon chem dog or it was
all fucking golden tangy or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all turned out if I messed it all up,
then maybe I would go to land race
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and start fresh there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some Afghan and maybe some Brazilian
and some Thai and then just start fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got three different things I can start
triangulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the next five or ten years,
I can have a lot of stuff generated to
[SPEAKER_00]: play with at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be doing a lot of fun phenol
hunts, but to me, not very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to a very certain niche of people out
there, those land races mean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like this may be some
direction you might want to go just by the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself focused because
whatever I smoked once again, it has got
[SPEAKER_00]: me going today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the cherry pot pie concentrates
from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to shout out to Green Dot
Labs, you know how to get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says with people constantly
traveling around and the ongoing search
[SPEAKER_00]: for shorter flowering periods in
commercial growing, how likely is it to
[SPEAKER_00]: find real or even new land races anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer I wrote down is you got to go
where Ariane hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ariane Roskam is the founder and breeder
for Greenhouse Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got respect for his breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what he's done with the industry,
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs coffee shops in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's got one of the most successful
seed companies in the planet, probably
[SPEAKER_00]: more cannabis cups than most people that I
can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's got a lot of awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he does something that gets my
attention here and it fits into this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ariane and his crew fly around to those
locations I was talking about where
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has been unadulterated for
hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, not the land race guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these land race plants have been
growing unadulterated for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Ariane goes there, meets with
the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take him to these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He meets the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give him permission to go into the
field and he collects the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, do what you want to do,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a couple of handfuls of seeds from
us isn't going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time out there in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very gracious hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ariane and his friends, they go and
they gather seeds and then they take the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds back to their greenhouse,
back to Amsterdam to their business
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find things they need to do to breed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how breeding should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do that kind of puts some alarms
up, puts up some red flags and makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned with what they're doing a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they are there, while they are on
these sacred land, if you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: on these little plots of cannabis on
unadulterated cannabis plots, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving the farmers with seeds that they
have made in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a lot of their popular and famous
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell because when they passed them
the seeds, they were color coded.
[SPEAKER_00]: A greenhouse seed company dips their seeds
in a color code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could tell which seeds are which.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lose the package, you can have a
whole bag of Skittles and you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the yellow ones are super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember the color code,
but they are color coded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I saw Ariane give this guy handfuls
of color coded seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that guy is going to go perhaps
possibly maybe grow those outdoors in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sacred unadulterated land race cannabis
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've been a little bit
unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's new shit happening out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new, new genes in the breeding
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: New shit has come to light, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traveling around and doing research,
how likely is it to find real land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go where Ariane hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go find, go where the people
don't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go where, find what region interests you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are several regions where these
land races are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, think about where all of our
favorite cannabis comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Brazilian, there's Thai,
there's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Pakistani weed that's really
fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's weed from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about what weed gets your
attention and fucking maybe it's Nepali
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's somewhere, maybe it's somewhere
real fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's somewhere real sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about where that weed comes from
and go there and start meeting people and
[SPEAKER_00]: build relationships and let them know,
hey, I'm a weed farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for the seeds from this region
so I can preserve them and start my own
[SPEAKER_00]: project and do something for the plant,
for the good of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers find each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja heads find each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushroom people find each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the land race folk, if this is
what you're meant to do, the world will
[SPEAKER_00]: put this into your lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go to those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or start doing some networking on the
internet and trust people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build relationships with someone you
trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some land race seeds from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land races are still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of places on the earth
that are untouched.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great places to go get
these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to decide what you want and
where to go get them and then develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship and go there and acquire
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to get them back to the
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's on you, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't encourage you to do anything
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next part of the question says,
if they are still around, how do
[SPEAKER_00]: professional breeders separate an original
land race from the many hybrids and strain
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if it's a land race, it doesn't
have, um, like, so, you know, most
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we'll say, let me pick a
strain out of the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just searching for something right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lemon, Jeffrey says lemon skunk X,
which means bred to or crossed or times.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say golden goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your lemon, Jeffrey X golden goat
in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, or your lemon skunk golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lemon, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a land race, it's just going to
say Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that Pakistani land race or that
Nepali land race or that Congolese hand
[SPEAKER_00]: land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it could be from a lot of different
places, but the land races, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to be crossed to
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could tell by the way that they
grow, uh, they grow wildly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times they don't have the
uniformity of any of the modern strains
[SPEAKER_00]: because they haven't been bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been selected for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nature has been selecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the battle of the fittest for the
last hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what grew the best is what grew the
best out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a land race, you probably got
it from another land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed seller or enthusiast, or you went and
got it, or it came from somebody from that
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how do professional readers separate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just because it's not
adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from that region and you know where
your seeds came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you could tell when you
grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The modern, modern bred stuff,
uh, is bred for social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bred for photography to sell seeds in
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of the shit on social
media is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of my best strains are not the
most photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my most photogenic strains are not
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the stuff that you see
online, uh, is bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're picking the best phenotype for the
internet and taking a picture of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling seeds based on the colors of the
leaves and the amount of frost on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't know if that plant's got any
resistance to bugs or pathogens or the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it tastes like fucking
cardboard, but at this point I am
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track here to the next
bullet point in this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if you want those real hybrids,
you got to go get them or get them from a
[SPEAKER_00]: true land race enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next part, are F1 hybrids based on
land races more vigorous than crosses that
[SPEAKER_00]: are derived from other crossed strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I kind of mentioned this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about more vigorous because
you get that F1 hybrid vigor, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost in, um, most of the crosses that
you make, even if it's modern stuff to old
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or modern to modern, old to old,
you've got healthy plants and you put
[SPEAKER_00]: those two new genes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most often you're going to get some
hybrids that are hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to see with these land
races, the words I wrote down as more
[SPEAKER_00]: wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much more wild since they're,
uh, these are like untamed animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have never seen a cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never had a leash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just fucking flailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe the leaves are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branching is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure is undesirable, but that's
not, like I said, they had happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to find the good shit in there
with the traits you like and breed that
[SPEAKER_00]: the direction you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, are the hybrid vigors based on
land races, more vigorous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would not say more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say more wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get hybrid vigor,
but they're going to find some wild shit
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my buddy, Stefan says, thanks for your
input, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for a great question for letting
me ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm not the land race guy,
so I don't know all of the land race
[SPEAKER_00]: details, but I hope I was able to answer
your question thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget to check your inbox for
that coupon code for a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this momentum going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go with this one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a friend in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything is good over there in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question starts off with... Hey,
thank you for listening in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to hear that I've got German
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's amazing to know that we are
international.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says...
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, these fast flowering plants have been
all the trend lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says... I understand all of the new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things that are after is
fast flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that a lot of people in
Germany are looking for fast flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I'm able to answer your
questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says...
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to grow outdoors, but autumn is
cold and wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm sure it does get cold and wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says... You know, our seasons are
different, so I'm not sure where that
[SPEAKER_00]: lines up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says...
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you are legal now with some
stipulations and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by saying congratulations
to our friends out there in Germany for
[SPEAKER_00]: their progress with legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's answer some of these questions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one...
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not myself played with fast
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer longer flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they give me better quality and
more yield, but I understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: situationally, that is not always ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not mess with the fast flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next part is... Honestly,
I bet there are strains that flower at
[SPEAKER_00]: 1410 already, but...
[SPEAKER_00]: Any home grower or home breeder that is
growing indoors has eliminated those from
[SPEAKER_00]: their breeding project or their selection
because it did not work for their indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't doing what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably got cold and eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are doing 1212 indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, real quickly, I'm going to touch back
on previous episodes and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: something called far red lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking about a plant that flowers
at 14 hours of light and 10 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness is what I think you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you may look outside and
you may think that you've got that 14
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of light out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what actually happens is as that sun
sets, that is putting off a red light
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum known as far red lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That far red lighting triggers a
phytochrome response in your plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: tells the plants it is time to go to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm certain that there are some plants
out there that that 14 hour day when you
[SPEAKER_00]: see the 14 hours, that's probably probably
13 or 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 12 hours of actual usable sunlight
because you've got the rising spectrum and
[SPEAKER_00]: the setting spectrum are a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you there are plenty of plants out
there that will flower with that 14 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually called the critical
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many hours of darkness it takes for a
plant to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably dependent on the location
on the globe or in relation to the equator
[SPEAKER_00]: where that plant came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would assume that there are plants
out there that would flower with that 14
[SPEAKER_00]: hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads me to another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you considered auto flower plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you want fast flowering,
but why not just give a try with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be another very viable option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good friend that grows outdoors
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does two, sometimes three crops with
our outdoor season when most people get
[SPEAKER_00]: one outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what my buddy does, he puts a round of
regular photo period plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got his photo period plants
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts them outside as soon as the
weather permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's Mother's Day here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he will put a round of auto flower
plants out on Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got one plant of photos,
one plant of autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now both of these plants begin to grow,
but eventually the auto flowers will go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower and they will flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time they finish, now the photo
periods start going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he chops one down and then he reloads
that plot with more auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time the other crop
finishes, he's got two more crops done at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he runs one photo period crop outdoors
and two auto flower crops outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets three crops in the time that most
people get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one big advantage to those auto
flowers is they are done way before the
[SPEAKER_00]: thieves and the rippers and the frost get
out there to destroy your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Colorado, people know we're
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start looking out for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come steal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a week before harvest, people will
come take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ran auto flowers, you're done way
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That time period even approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the root of the question was about fast
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any experience with the auto
flowers or the fast flowers, but I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there are very good uses for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got the opportunity,
plant a row of both, do some fast flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a row of auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to get frisky,
maybe even put out a row of photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these questions from new markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: As new markets come on, there will be new
questions, new demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you may want to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you have got the cold and wet
weather in autumn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe, you may want to do some
breeding and develop a strain that works
[SPEAKER_00]: very well in your climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of the first growers out
there to get a head start and start
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding outdoor plants in your region
that are already adapted to your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and ready for your conditions,
you will be far ahead of the market and
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds will sell very well to every
outdoor farmer in your region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every section and region that it works,
you can sell those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably work indoors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my new friend from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I was able to give you some solid
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do win a coupon code for a free pack
of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm not sure if we can ship those
seeds safely to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put Germany in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see that, I will reach out and we
will figure out if we're going to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: a shirt or a hoodie or if we're going to
attempt to send some seeds to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danke ein Freund.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: skateboarders and fruit booters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
for listening to another episode of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: Go grab the new tin foil hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tin foil hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban poison crossed to afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a 70, 72 day flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big tall plants with a crazy head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it tin foil hat because it'll have
you talking about conspiracies and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you some iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check the website,
the other website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need strain info, strain details,
all of that stuff is kept on a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: website for logistics purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So iregenetics.com has got all the
details, all the info on all the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is a link to the Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link to the Patreon so you can
support the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to the Discord server.

[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff, you bad mother... Time to take
another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your piece and a hug and find the
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit back, hug him up, be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aura.
