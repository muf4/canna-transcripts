[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 872 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's podcast, I'm going to talk
about taking care of incoming plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many websites are selling rooted clones
and fresh snips.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about taking care of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is ieregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of that website, there's a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab, you can send me
a grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds at ieredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's question came from our new friend
who wants to be called a egoless gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my new friend egoless
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Egoless, make sure you check your inbox
and check your spam because you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
ieredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question does start off by talking
about how they ordered clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They received their clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked a little bit rough because of
the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told me how they took care of them,
which is exactly what I would have done
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they do ask a very important
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump into the question portion of
this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, finally, my question,
what would you recommend folks do when
[SPEAKER_01]: receiving snips and rooted clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this could help many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I learned the old fashioned way,
excuse me, I learned the old fashioned
[SPEAKER_01]: way, which was trial and error through
taking losses and calling it taxes of the
[SPEAKER_01]: game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've talked about many websites out
there now are selling rooted clones or
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of websites, a lot of
vendors, a lot of breeders are doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, my fresh cuts are available at
ieredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this website comes out,
there may be some fresh cuts of lemon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffrey and dark hollow left available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those do sell quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do buy cuts, do pay attention to
the disclaimer on the website that says
[SPEAKER_01]: they will not ship for several days
because it is super cold here in my region
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is zero degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I put your clones in the mail and zero
degrees, they will not get to you in one
[SPEAKER_01]: piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be toast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not be the opposite of toast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will look like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be very mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so will the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to wait until it's a little
bit warmer before I put any clips,
[SPEAKER_01]: any snips, any slips, whatever you want to
call them, or any rooted clones into the
[SPEAKER_01]: mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting anything with moisture like that
in the mail right now is a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will rupture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am selling clones on ieredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many vendors selling clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do if you order these fresh
cuts in the mail?
[SPEAKER_01]: You order these rooted clones in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying a lot of money depends on
where you buy them, depends on which cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do cost money and money is expensive
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that we want to have,
and I want you to have the best success
[SPEAKER_01]: you can when you do spend money on my
website with my product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even if you're buying a clone from
someone else, I still want you to have
[SPEAKER_01]: great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do buy clones from a website,
we'll specifically talk about ieredirect
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things you should keep in mind and
some things that will help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I spray my plants twice a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a nice collection of different
pesticides of different efficacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: might be the word that I'm saying,
of different toxicity, might be the word
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for, of different gentleness
and abrasiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a nice array of pesticides that I
have on a shelf and I will mix those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually generally use two different
pesticides at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple modes of attack will definitely
take out and prevent any problems that may
[SPEAKER_01]: come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm spraying these plants twice a week
with a nice array of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be straight up with you, some of them
are not organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're worried about 100% organic,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will isolate a plant for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll dedicate one to just organic
sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, as a breeder in a state where
everybody grows and where I'm around a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of growers, I don't treat with strictly
organic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a lot of different pesticides,
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rotate.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is these plants will be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clones will have been treated over
time while they're on the mother plant
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be pest and fungus-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you can count on because
I sprayed today is Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprayed today just a couple of hours
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprayed some stuff on the garden today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights are still off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be turned on when I'm done
recording here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are sprayed quite frequently
to make sure there's no pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: no problems on those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've got several mother plants in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of different locations
with different mother plants, which the
[SPEAKER_01]: clones may come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Randomly, those plants are tested like a
sports team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pick somebody on the team,
this plant here and this plant here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get HLVD testing that is hoplite
and viroid testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm testing the plants randomly to see
if there is HLVD in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, there is none.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as it stays clean, there is no
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds and the clones are HLVD free.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do bring in a clone, this is
something you should work on as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep this in mind because this is not in
my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that just came up in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I receive a clone from somebody,
whether it's a vendor, whether it's a bro,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a stranger sending a gift,
if I buy a clone from a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I get it from a Shady Craigslist deal,
that clone does not go directly into my
[SPEAKER_01]: grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That clone grows into a quarantine
isolated area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that quarantine is right here at
this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area is far enough from any of my
grow spaces that I can put a plant here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give it enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I use studio lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to make it grow rapidly and
be a thriving plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making sure it doesn't have bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm watching it, looking for powdery
mildew to pop up, watching to see if I see
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites on it, looking to see if I
see any thrips or fungus gnats fly up out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as that plant gets here,
I get it on the table, get it comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will spray it with, I spray that
thing with some crazy pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three different things to make sure
it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you do that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your clones in, put them in
isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you get it from me, even if you
get it from your other favorite breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: your favorite vendor, we all say we're
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty girls have problems too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you're isolating these
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they come in, treat them,
spray them, set them aside, check on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look under the underside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure there's no bugs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that plant is clean before you
put it in your general population.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't want to contaminate the rest
of the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I recommend you do with the
clone as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're checking for HLVD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get a cut, that shit gets isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I will take an immediate cut when
it's big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take some roots and some plant
material, send that bad bitch into my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was harder to say than it should have
been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might need more dabs, but we send that
test into Farmer Freeman and they let us
[SPEAKER_01]: know that they are HLVD-free before
they're put into the regular population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already got the tests here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ordered them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're on deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I've got to do is take the samples and
send it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes priority mail three, maybe four
days to get it there, depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: busy they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll test it within two to three days of
getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have an answer in less than a week
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant can sit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get HLVD in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what else is important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Discrete shipping, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I send everything either priority mail or
priority express mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clips are just coming priority mail to
save you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the budget, cost-effective way to
do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get three clips for 50, 60, maybe 40
bucks on some strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get three fresh cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to the mother plant and I fucking cut
that bad bitch off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrap it in a wet paper towel,
put it in a baggie, put it in a priority
[SPEAKER_01]: mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the weather, I may add other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on another note here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is all any priority mail or
sometimes a priority mail express box,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I've been told is going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The priority mail express will disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Priority mail express boxes are always
late.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of refunds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys get a lot of refunds for those
because those bad bitches are never on
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get those refunded if your product
is not delivered on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the postal service has a hard time
finding a contractor to deliver those on
[SPEAKER_01]: time, is what I've been told.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that service will disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, it's off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all just going to be priority mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your plants will all come that service,
which will save some of you a few bucks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't write fucking ganja clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say Rasta Jeff's Pot Farm or
anything on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on when we ship, I rotate the
return address a few times, but it will
[SPEAKER_01]: come from a post office box with a
discreet return address on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't know that it's even a clone
until you open it unless you're expecting
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are very discreetly shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I said a moment ago, I am
experimenting with it is cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is cold as fuck as my unit of
measurement right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's zero degrees, to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over here in a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the heat cranked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a heater vent right behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cold over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been putting those... The glove
warmers worked better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I bought some of those reptile shipper
warmer things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they get hot enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't seem to keep the plants warm
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the clone in a thermal envelope
with the reptile warmers that are supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to last 72 hours, which should be long
enough to get it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during this cold time, I'm going to
take a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it's not super cold, I still ship
them with those glove warmers to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them warm for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm spraying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're HLV tested, discreet shipping,
and I'm experimenting with keeping them
[SPEAKER_01]: warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the basics of my shipping they
get to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about how to take care of
these plants because that's what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that you order... We're going to
start with a rooted clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, the rooted clones are
somewhere between and it depends on which
[SPEAKER_01]: clones you're buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many of them, but they start off
around 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work their way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that is quite pricey that I
don't put up too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get it because they
disappear quickly, I chicken out and take
[SPEAKER_01]: it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a rooted cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: This rooted cut comes in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a priority mail express box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut the box open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull that bad bitch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a thermal envelope inside of
there, possibly with a heat pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even a sticker or two, depending on
how much of a hurry I was in when I packed
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get your clone out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it out of the baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carefully unwrap that root section.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just in a paper, a wet paper towel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unwrap that slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got a clone that is just
exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will have long dangly roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get to my notes here because I know
I wrote down stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: These clones came most of the time so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may adjust to the plugs and the dome and
tray thing here in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's easier for you guys, let me know
how you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these come from an easy cloner,
a turbo cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easy cloner is my preferred method of
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets long fat roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best part is I don't have to use a
dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hate the clone domes,
the humidity domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just such a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta fuck with it every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the easy cloner, you set it,
forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You check the pH in the EC once a day and
you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these all come from an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have long roots and they'll be
dangling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots are just free.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not in any sort of media.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wrapped in a paper towel to stay
safe during travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not in a clone plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not in any dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, it's a clone with roots
hanging off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta be prepared for that when
that comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I recommend, I would get a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just your, is it a 16, a 20 ounce beer
cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your red solo cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you know what I'm talking about,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poke a few holes in the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, four holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stab it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light up your poker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat up the poker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stab it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want it to get stagnant water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna take your cup,
your beer cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna poke a few holes in it on the
very bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're gonna fill that with your
favorite, your recommended light soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Light Warrior.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Ocean Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Happy Frog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a mixture of the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: A soil that's gonna have plenty of
drainage and not a lot of nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want a lot of nutrients to burn
this plant already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got light soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, so we'll say that the roots
are probably two and a half, three and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half, maybe four inches long, depending on
how long that clone sat in the clone or
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking waiting for me to, for weather to
get right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got some roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna fill that cup about two
thirds, three quarters of the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how long the roots are and
how deep you want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill that cup up with soil most of the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pack it kind of not firmly, but not tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get it in there to where,
so the roots have to work their way
[SPEAKER_01]: through there, but not struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a hard thing to judge,
but you want it packed, but not stuffed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got that bottom layers in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start lowering the clone in there
and sprinkle some dirt in there at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to happen is I don't want the
roots to get in a big ball and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to coil up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to kind of make a spiral around
that new dirt that you're putting in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spiral that around there so they've got
somewhere to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ball them up, they're gonna grow
and get stuck into a big ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: So slowly lower that clone in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get the clone, this is hard to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten very lucky a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a little mound of dirt,
like a cone of dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside your cup, if you can lower that
clone in there, if those roots will spread
[SPEAKER_01]: over that clone over the top, over that
cone, that's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel super excited when I see it happen,
but it's hard to make happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we want to spread those roots out
in this medium, kind of far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them to spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then fill that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill that cup with soil until that plant
is sturdy, until it's staying upright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna have roots and then you're
gonna have a little bit of stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go a quarter, a half inch,
maybe three quarters of an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up that stick and bury that in there so
that it stays sturdy and stays tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go too deep and don't go too tight
is my biggest suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too deep, the part that is buried
will have the potential to get some rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it stays too wet, too long,
that part will start to rot and get funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pack it too tight, the roots can't
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, we've lowered our clone
down into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've carefully maneuvered those roots so
they're not in a ball, not in a big coil,
[SPEAKER_01]: not in a spiral.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spread them out the best we
carefully can without breaking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we bury that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't go too deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't wanna go too deep to get the rot
like we just talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't wanna go too tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this point, we're gonna water this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pack that soil in there fairly smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need to water this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend feeding this plant some
microbes at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm gonna say recharge,
because I'm good friends with Scotty Reel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Scotty Reel and the Dude
Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would add some recharge to your
water and water this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give it too much nutrients at this
time, depending on what you just potted it
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put it into something inert,
then maybe give it some very light veg
[SPEAKER_01]: newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're using most of the Fox Farms
products, most of the soil you could buy
[SPEAKER_01]: from the store, you're gonna have plenty
of nutrients for a couple of weeks for
[SPEAKER_01]: this little plant, maybe a week or two to
get it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we fill the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we put a little mound in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lower the roots onto the mound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We backfill it till it's filled up,
till the plant is sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pack it in there with our fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water it with some microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we water it, it's gonna disrupt the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The topsoil is gonna get all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have a hole, you're gonna
have divots or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of push that around with your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smooth that in and kind of just pack it in
tight enough to where that plant stays
[SPEAKER_01]: sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this point, let me check my notes
and make sure we're doing all this
[SPEAKER_01]: according to my notes, because I haven't
looked in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water with microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then at this point, this is
where I recommend getting a clear beer
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get another clear cup,
I would put this right on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't poke any holes in this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to trap the humidity inside that
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that plant to have limited airflow
and maximum humidity inside of that little
[SPEAKER_01]: dome space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now that plant needs to adjust to
your new environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend just put a little
dome over there and let that dome just
[SPEAKER_01]: rest over that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be there for too long,
hopefully just a day or two, until you can
[SPEAKER_01]: tell that that plant kind of perks out of
its shipping stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may look a little pissed off when it
comes out of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that dome over there and let that dome
hang out on top of that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably just 12, 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant looks turgid and stiff and
it's sturdy and standing up, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: take the dome off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it looks a little pissed off,
a little upset, leave that dome there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will help that plant adjust to its
new life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it kind of looks sad, you can slowly
take it off and let it adjust slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it on for a few hours, take it off
for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it on for a few hours, take it off
for a couple more minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce it slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will help that plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got your clear cup on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I would place it under 18,
6, or more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is 18 hours of light,
6 hours off, or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do 19, 5, 24, 0, your preference,
but at least 18 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would use like a T5 light or a
light fluorescent light, or just put it
[SPEAKER_01]: off in the periphery of your big light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put it right under the big light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be too much light for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need enough light to keep it warm and
to generate humidity in that humidity dome
[SPEAKER_01]: is our main function right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it warm and get some humidity going
to get it recovering, to encourage root
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those roots start going, the plant
will recover and it will be very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that recharge hits it, it'll get some
shit going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got it covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got it under a good light.
[SPEAKER_01]: High humidity is really good at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should recover quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would consider a heat mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your room is cold, maybe put it under a
heat mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a beer cup, maybe you
can create some sort of humidity dome with
[SPEAKER_01]: another vessel, maybe some sort of clear
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'd be a good idea to cover it some
sort of way just to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take a like a two liter soda
bottle, cut the bottom off, clean it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, set that right on top of there
just to minimize the airflow and the wind
[SPEAKER_01]: and the outside environment to that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep some heat, some humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying those things, but they want
it warm and moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help your clone survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then introduce it to your outdoor
environment, your regular grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: environment slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the rooted plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be pretty sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came from that easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have fat roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those should work quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me review just because I did that
quickly in my own head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill the beer cup carefully, pot it
carefully, water with microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it under a light, put a dome over that
bad bitch and take care of it slowly and
[SPEAKER_01]: take that dome off slowly if you want to
introduce it to the environment slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about the fresh cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said before, the fresh cuts are
definitely the more cost effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're good at rooting a cut,
this is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they run from $40 to $60 for three
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if I have a lot, I'll throw an
extra one in there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to be the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way there's no confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole bag is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about these rooted cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are fresh cuts from the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not have roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be very clear about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we say snips, some people say slips,
some people say cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send it to you and you have
got to root it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send me cuts, I'm just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can root those bad bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fresh cuts come straight from the
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, a healthy mother plant is a
really important part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are ready to put in your easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easy cloner is real simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that, but they're also
ready to put into clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do in the future if you would like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Request this and the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want full details on my full
step-by-step how I do clones in a rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: rooter and dome environment or in an easy
cloner environment, comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get enough comments on it that you
guys need that guidance and advice to go
[SPEAKER_01]: full fucking details, I'll do that in the
next episode or an upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now we're going to go kind of
quickly on how we do the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend if you've got an easy cloner,
you should know how to do it, but let's
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clones are going to come you're going
to unwrap them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would clip off the ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give them a fresh clip at the ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then dip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you dip them in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your favorite cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the purple clone X gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple clone X stuff is reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works very well for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we even do this, before we even
take the clones out of the machine,
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the fucking package, set up the
cloning machine 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean the clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you want to do it, you could fill
it with bleach and rinse it out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fill it with boiling water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use Fizan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it is clean and sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And use good clean clone collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's harder to say than it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a fresh clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your water is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EC is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that in the upcoming
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bubbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clone collars are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a light above it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point you take the clones out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give them a fresh cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cut the ends off again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them just trim the ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an eighth of an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut those right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then dip those cuts individually into your
purple clone X clone gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then stick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically Ronco style, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure to label these clones some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a plastic plant tag and I write the
name and I put it inside the neoprene
[SPEAKER_01]: collar where the little pac-man bites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stick it right in there with the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to label all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set up the cloner is the most important
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the clone collar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label it and let it ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let those sit in about 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after 24 hours, adjust your EC,
your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, I would also add some
stuff called clear res.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow the instructions on the clear res
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did I tell you to wait 24 hours to
adjust the pH and the EC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all that purple shit that you did
dipped your clones in is going to fall off
[SPEAKER_01]: your clones or get washed off the clones
into the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now most of that is in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is a good time to adjust the pH and
the EC instead of before.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using the yellow clone X,
the piss stuff, the clone solution that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes in the cloner, it looks like P in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using it in a cloner or in the
plugs, I recommend a solution of 0.9 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.1 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That range is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is right where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.9 will get you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.1 will be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I recommend you use the yellow clone X
gel or the yellow clone X solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pour it into your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stir it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use an EC meter until it says one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want your cloner or your
solution to measure as.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got your EC at one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH, I would go about 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get it to 6.2, that would be
ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clone pH solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EC is controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you another secret at
the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow exactly what that secret says.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will get you there every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cloner is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have it prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then clip them, dip them, stick them,
label them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it ride for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then get in there with your EC meter and
your pH pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adjust the EC and the pH properly and then
pour in some clear res and you are good to
[SPEAKER_01]: go with the clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a quick drink and then
we're going to talk about how to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: with your clone plugs.

[SPEAKER_01]: support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough blatant advertising, enough
shameless plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of plugs, I said we were going to
talk about how to take care of your clone
[SPEAKER_01]: in the clone plug environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say you got some unrooted cuts
in the mail and it is time to get these
[SPEAKER_01]: bad dogs into some cloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I recommend you soak your
clone plugs, whatever plugs you bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're rapid routers, if they're
another brand that I can't even think of
[SPEAKER_01]: the name of right now, I recommend you
fill a vessel with water and then you make
[SPEAKER_01]: an EC of 1.0 with that yellow piss looking
clone X solution, not the purple one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow one is what we want this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your EC meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the plugs in there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got water, you got your EC meter,
you're adding the solution, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: stirring and making it to get to 1.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go too high, add more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just fix it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a way to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would even pH the water at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH that water to about six, two ish is
probably where you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you a hint in a little
while with the exact pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're going to want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soak your plugs with the pH clone X
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the water, drop all the plugs in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the plugs are in there, take them out
one at a time, put them in that clone
[SPEAKER_01]: tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you're doing, this is the
clone tray method is what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, you got your plugs
soaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do the same thing we did
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to clip the ends off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dip them in the purple
solution, and then we're going to dip them
[SPEAKER_01]: into those clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clone plugs are about this tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not stick your clone through the bottom
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use a pen and my fingers as a
demonstration here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to go, so if the clone plug is this
tall, I'm going to say that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just going to make up numbers
because I want this to be visible,
[SPEAKER_01]: usable for people who are not watching for
people who are just listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that clone plug is about an inch
tall, maybe an inch and a half tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go, if it's an inch tall,
I would go three quarters of an inch into
[SPEAKER_01]: that plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go three quarters of the way into
the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stick your clone all the way out of
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will not live.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need some room for that bad dog to
grow some roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go about three quarters of the way in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that clone plug is an inch tall,
go three quarters of an inch into there,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe just over half of an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to leave some room for those roots
to grow in there, but also we need plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: to support that plant because it's going
to be living in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be tall enough or deep enough
to support the height of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clip them, dip them, stick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you guys, here's another tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're taking clones, if you've got
big leafy cuts that you're taking,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't feel free to cut the fingers off of
those leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut them right at the knuckles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the leaves taper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go fatter, fatter, fatter,
and then at some point they start to go
[SPEAKER_01]: skinnier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right where they start to go skinnier,
you could chop that shit off if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need all that vegetative part in
our clone dome, in the cloning machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trim the fingers off your clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grab them from the bottom and pull it up
and just give them a little haircut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it super quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm real good at it at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a clone in the mail from me
and it's been all fucking mohawked,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's several reasons behind this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so that when they're in the cloner,
they're not overlapping and touching and
[SPEAKER_01]: creating moisture and little microclimates
between each other, which will cause
[SPEAKER_01]: problems in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clip them, dip them, clean up the ends
of them, then stick them into your clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: your clone plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let me make a quick recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to put three clones in a
clone tray, I also recommend if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: more plants that you can get clones from,
I would recommend filling this tray the
[SPEAKER_01]: best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for that is the amount of
humidity in this dome will be affected by
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of plants inside that dome as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a small piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will help you keep the humidity up in
there if you've got more plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, we've got our clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been clipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been dipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been hair-cutted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been stuck into the cloner or into
the plug, a half to three quarters of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put a little bit of the leftover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that solution we dunked our clone
plugs in earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you didn't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little bit of that in the bottom of
your clone tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the insert with the plugs in it,
and that goes into a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little bit of that solution into the
tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to buy ourselves some moisture to
make humidity in this tray and this dome
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little bit, maybe just splash
enough in there just to cover the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's not dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cover that bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually that moisture is going to come
up to the top and become humidity and fall
[SPEAKER_01]: back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to take, now this is what I'm
going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take the dome, the lid to
this tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cover and close all the
plugs, all the holes on that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cover all the vents is the
word I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to cover all the vents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to get a spray bottle and
I'm going to spray the inside of that dome
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's nice and misty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it got all humid already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to set myself up ahead of time
here and just mist it and get some water
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to put that on top of that
tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got my freshly cut clones and
they're all labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up a step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fucking remember to label each and
every one of these clones very carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, I use the plant tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a long, tall, skinny plant tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write the name of the plant on there and
stick it right behind that plug inside
[SPEAKER_01]: that tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you can't get any mix-ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that every plant's got a tag in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So label them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we put the dome on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a dome, a tray filled with cuts
waiting to get rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This point I would put this dome under
like a T5 light or a light, what are they
[SPEAKER_01]: called?
[SPEAKER_01]: An LED light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot what an LED was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the dome under a nice light and put it
on 24 hours of light if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18.6 would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours would be best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got your dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, maybe put that on a heat mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heat mat will help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful not to barbecue the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen so many people just boil and
barbecue clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it that hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it warm, not boiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me make sure I've got my notes here
because I'm just rambling and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get this out of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on the heat mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it under the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that ride for about four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to have to check on that
for three or four, maybe five or six days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tap that dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no humidity in the dome,
you need to open it and create some
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe spray in there or check on the
moisture level of those plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should be able to walk by and look
at it and there should be humidity built
[SPEAKER_01]: up on that dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tap it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity will fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look through the dome at that point and
look into the plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the color of the plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll start to tell, do they look dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look moist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look wet?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to tell by looking at them
by the color of the plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to keep them moist, but not
dripping and not soggy, but they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be wet all the way through from top to
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see those clone plugs starting
to get dry, what I recommend, take that
[SPEAKER_01]: same solution we made earlier,
the 1.0 solution of the clone X solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: pH did 6.2, 6.4, or check the thing I'm
going to tell you for the absolute detail
[SPEAKER_01]: in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some of that in a spray bottle,
just a basic spray bottle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And spray those plugs until they're nice
and moist again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cover them back up and then put
them back under that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave them there just like that for about
seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around day seven, you can start cracking
those vents a little bit more and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're comfortable with the vents all
the way open, then you can start taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the dome off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the dome off for 15 minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it back on for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it off for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day, 45 minutes, slowly increase
your interval until you start seeing those
[SPEAKER_01]: roots growing out of those plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start getting fat, healthy roots
if you do this correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: At which time, then you can plop those
into a beer cup and treat them just like
[SPEAKER_01]: the other cuts that I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check my notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly open the domes and increase the
interval until roots are developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's where I'm going to tell you
about the secret that I keep hinting
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got a Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the iReArmy Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a link in the show notes and
in the video description.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also a link on my website,
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take you to my Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are overwhelmed and
confused by Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as challenging as it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to open it right now on my
computer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a minute for this
MacBook to open it, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a peek.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening is on the left is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for it to open here,
but if you look at all the descriptions,
[SPEAKER_01]: those just tell you what's going on in
that tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on the tab that says iReArmy
general chat, if you click on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes you to just a general chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could chat about whatever you want in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a Smoker's Lounge, which is a
live video chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take dabs on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a fun grow question or you
just want to ask me about something or
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about life, come in the Smoker's
Lounge chat and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Grower's Lounge chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all fun in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that list of tabs, one of them does
say clone care SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look for it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clicking on my server.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the iReArmy Discord is the one with the
big cross as the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We click on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says iReArmy Discord at top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rules and etiquette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get new rules here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to scroll down several tabs down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Potent Ponics for being in
the Smoker's Lounge chat right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aquaponics Steve is over there chilling
out talking to the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scroll down even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that says grow themed chats in
there on the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very bottom is the STS video where I
teach you how to make silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_01]: and reverse your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right above that is the clone care
SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that, clone care SOP and
scroll up to the top and read the original
[SPEAKER_01]: SOP that I posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like a lot of people have
given me a lot of feedback on there as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the clone SOP that I use in a
commercial cultivation facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's clone the arrow cloner or in
clone rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both SOPs are fairly short.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could probably use some updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see something that needs updates,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you join my Discord server
absolutely free, these SOPs are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an SOP on the silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a clone care SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an IPM chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things that could help a lot of
people out are happening in the Discord
[SPEAKER_01]: server.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I keep talking about these secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all here on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: PH the cloner to 5.7 to 6.2 is what it
says.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of details are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need in-depth details, it's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, if you would like a
full, if you want me to do this clone care
[SPEAKER_01]: SOP as a podcast, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it out as a full podcast,
a long-form episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comment in the comment section and make
your demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, boys and girls, I think that's
the best I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you get these cuts and clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: These cuts and clones are available at
ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to my main website,
ireagenetics.com, there's a link for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Discord server, ireadirect is where to
get the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is where to contribute to the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much self-explanatory on the
tabs up at the top of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if you want more SOPs,
if you want me to do the SOPs as full
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, please comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get those shows going for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, my buddy, Eaglest
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all of you out there for
another great episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm super rambly today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep this one short and
sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrap it up and get out of here quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back in a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be back in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said on the previous episode,
my birthday is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of fun shit coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might just take a week off and not
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I might miss it and want
to come do a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows what could happen here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep checking on me on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, like and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you don't miss any episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let you go for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go hang out with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back with fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big shout out to my
buddy, G Bay Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab and give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to take another damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your piece and a hug up out the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is in the lab.
