[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Orange
Skittles live batter from Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, it says the potency is
66.7% THC and 77.2% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate smells disgustingly
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost overwhelmingly citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a funkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Skittles describes it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lingers on the tongue for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take a nice dab and if you don't
take a drink, it'll just hang out on your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth and you get that nice orangey,
citrusy, lemon kind of a flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really hangs out for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the buzz is really like straight to
the face, straight to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me a little bit goofy,
a little bit forgetful, but I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm good at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be great podcast concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Orange Skittles live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I do have an excellent show planned for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the main topic,
let's do some shout outs to a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to roll up some digital
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pack up some virtual dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pass over some JPEG bong
rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep everybody safe and
healthy during this weird quarantine and
[SPEAKER_00]: social distancing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're listening to this in the
future, man, read about the quarantine and
[SPEAKER_00]: the social distancing in 2020,
it was fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we're going to stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep the social distancing
in effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pass over some digital
dabs, some virtual bong rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off by rolling up a big fat
digital joint, lighting it up digitally
[SPEAKER_00]: and passing it over to my buddy,
Brett C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's pack up a big fat fresh bong
load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send that one over to my buddy,
Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to roll a big fat digital
blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to light that one up for my
buddy, Mason66.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how about we take a big fat dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get way too big of a dab and heat up
that nail and get that one going for my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, Tobes McLovin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fill up one of those ridiculous
vaporizer bags and pass that over to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, Captain Mojo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bake a batch of edibles that are
surprisingly potent and send a big package
[SPEAKER_00]: of those over to my buddy, Willie's
armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just roll up a big Bob Marley sized
joint of the stinkiest herb you have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's light that up and pass it over to my
buddy, Steve Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Steve Smith for having
the same name as one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: drummers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also roll up a big fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sprinkle some keif down the middle
of this joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put some shatter on the outside of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap a snake of shatter right around
the outside of the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to burn crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to light that fucker up and
pass that over to Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about my buddy, Godfather Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I have got the biggest dab of the
freshest rosin for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, Godfather Kush
for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a big fat dab of some
freshly pressed blue raspberry truffle
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin for my buddy Baked PWN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
let's bake up some super potent
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic high blueberry muffins and
send those out to my buddy, Stabby Mick
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucking Stabwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who has
continued to support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show, all you have to do is visit www
[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did include a link in the show notes to
make it easy for all of my stoned friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having fun with me with the
digital dabs and digital bong rips and
[SPEAKER_00]: virtual blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to stay positive in this weird
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people are struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know things are weird for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying to shed some light on things
and keep it positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a really fun message to read
on this episode of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently posted a six year celebration
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently celebrated our sixth year in
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was episode 518.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode got a tremendous amount of
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of iTunes, Apple podcast
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of stitcher reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a ton of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to say is a lot of people
responded to that and I appreciate and
[SPEAKER_00]: love the interaction in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read what was my favorite
comment in the entire YouTube comment feed
[SPEAKER_00]: for that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comment came from my friend who calls
himself Fumidor and the flavors on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Fumidor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fumidor is also a part of the Embracing
Organics podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a live show every Thursday on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show starts at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what time zone you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's mountain time for me and
that it is seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to adjust your clocks
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the show on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the previous episodes are still
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it is called Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Fumidor joins us on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also on a few other shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is part of the Portland Cannabis
Tasting Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a big cannabis spokesperson in the
Pacific Northwest area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's a very well-spoken dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always a very polite young man,
which is hard to find these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just forgot all about
manners and rules, but I really respect
[SPEAKER_00]: Fumidor and he asked a great question on
my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, congrats on six
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, now, if you had to put
all of the dabs together and weigh them,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, how long would it take you to
dab that pile in one go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you listen to the podcast,
you know that at the beginning of every
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, I take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of a tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit down, get the podcast gear lined up,
I get my notes together, and then a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of minutes before I record, I like to take
a couple of dabs and get my brain moving
[SPEAKER_00]: or sometimes stop it from moving,
depends on what I'm smoking and where I
[SPEAKER_00]: start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you listen, you know it's become a
tradition that I do start the show by
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, in six years of
podcasting, if you put all of the dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: together, how much would it weigh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second question is,
how long would it take to smoke it all in
one go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was a funny and interesting
question, so I decided to tackle this with
[SPEAKER_00]: some stoner math.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I read this, there were 520 episodes,
so my math goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are approximately 520 episodes to
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a quarter to a half gram dab to
start each episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes approximately 260 grams if I
take one or two dabs before each show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I said, that is unlikely because I
probably take closer to two or four dabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's possibly up to 520 grams of
pre-show dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So approximately 520 grams have been
dabbed just before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I added on to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've had Dab and Granny,
Maddie and Spence, the Turpex crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy, Barefoot, and a host of other
heavy dabbers on the show who have all
[SPEAKER_00]: helped increase our consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably smoked another full pound
during the pre-show and on-air smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about all of the people who have
joined me on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, Jesse, Sean, Barefoot Grower,
Chris and Lindsey used to be on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their friend Shannon came on the show a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy has been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe has been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a garden of weed and crew comes
and just smokes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a gang of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is like the only one that doesn't
smoke dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that's been on the show,
I think, has come and taken a dab on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Becca didn't take a dab from Elevate
now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't dab, but there were very few
people that did not take dabs while they
[SPEAKER_00]: were on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have probably smoked 520 grams of
pre-show dabs myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to guess that the crew,
the gang, has smoked at least another
[SPEAKER_00]: pound on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my reply was my short answer is one
pound to myself and two pounds total.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make sense to me without
sounding like I'm exaggerating or trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to over inflate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just the pre-show dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we all sit down and say,
are you ready to do a show?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody gets here and we congregate
at the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start pulling out the rig and
the torch and we all have a little smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get a little bit silly and
there's always a moment of silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, oh fuck, we all just got way high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when I've got to go,
you guys ready to record?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody goes, oh shit,
we got to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is just our pre-show and on-air
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say a pound for me and then
another pound for all of the crew because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here for every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to guess, I've probably only had
a guest on probably a quarter to a third
[SPEAKER_00]: of every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those were probably Mike and
he doesn't take big enough dabs or enough
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs to make too much of a dent in the
concentrate pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure over 520 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he was on a quarter of them,
that's a little over a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably take a 0.2 dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would add up eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably smoked a couple grams on the
show, but not as significant as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a really fun and
entertaining question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Fumidor and the
Flavors on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's FumidorChibidor on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to give him a follow and check us
out on the Embracing Organics podcast live
[SPEAKER_00]: every Thursday on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a follow-up to this question
that said, how long would it take to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this over again in one go?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a ridiculous question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine smoking one to two pounds of
concentrates in one go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is considered one go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did reply to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, how many naps do I get to take in
this one go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, honestly, I think my
throat would burn out before I get too
[SPEAKER_00]: high to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think my lungs and my throat would
be interested in dabbing about a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: pound into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would all be looking at each other
like, let's just give up and go eat
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think after that many concentrates and
that many dabs, everybody would just want
[SPEAKER_00]: like a mango smoothie or something nice on
the throat that makes your throat feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your throat is going to hurt after that
many dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would probably burn out my lungs and
my body before my brain got too high to
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm down to give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to bring me two pounds of
concentrates and set them here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table, you can smoke one and I'll smoke
one and we can see how far into these
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of concentrates we can get before
we just decide to give up and go get food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do continue my comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said, if I smoke my one pound
portion by myself, I could comfortably
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke one to two grams per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a challenge, I could smoke three
to seven grams a day without
[SPEAKER_00]: over-medicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to conserve, one gram per day is
sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, when we're quarantined,
I'm trying to stay on one gram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My standard normal comfortable level is
about a gram and a half to two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because it's available to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going in, if it's like 420 or
Friday, I could smoke like three grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was really trying, I could do three
to seven grams in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were going in, like if you're like,
how much do you think you could smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably take down 10 of these
apothecary one gram jars or 10 of these
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs one gram jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet I could take down 10 of them in a
day by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have friends over, those numbers
change drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, depending on who the friends
are, if it's Clint, the dabs don't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's Matt, he takes little dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's Mike, he takes little dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of my friends, they'll come over
and they'll get globby and they're welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I invite them over for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make them cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to watch them change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to my buddy,
Fumidor and the Flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posts wonderful videos, wonderful
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great, well-spoken dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank him for the great YouTube
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not already doing so,
I think it would be a whole lot cooler if
[SPEAKER_00]: you followed me on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube, search for the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, click subscribe,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe leave some comments on the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will read one of your videos,
one of your comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be easier to read your comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it moving by jumping into the
email portion of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to read emails that come from my
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a cannabis cultivation or a
cannabis culture question, or in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, a cannabis concentrate question,
I would love to answer your question on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on today's episode goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I hope all is
well and you are staying safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing my exercises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking my vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been eating well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had any caffeine or sugary crap
or sodas in about six or eight weeks now
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for checking on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are doing your part to stay
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with my face?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those concentrates are working or they're
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may take a break and rip a dab here in
just a moment if that keeps happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are doing your part to stay
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe and healthy as well,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I have a couple of
questions and I'll try to keep them short
[SPEAKER_00]: and to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good way to get your
question on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say first, what is the best
way to store both the BHO and hash for
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term preservations of terpenes and
THC and other cannabinoids and volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have added a couple of words to that
sentence, but we're close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, I like to keep a wide
variety of flavors at one time and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to periodically dab on each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each gram lasts me about two months
because it's not being dabbed on every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a wine cooler that I'm able to
control the humidity on, so I'm wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: what the best option is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remind me a lot of myself and a lot of
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concentrates do not last me nearly as
long as yours, but when I go to the store,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to get one of that one,
one of that one, one of that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time I do the same thing and
I go before I run out, so I do have a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: buffet of concentrates on my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Mambo Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Cowboy Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Soul Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got GG4.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Orange Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a whole bunch of, there's more shits
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having the buffet and the variety
just like yourself, but I kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I put two or three of them on the table
and I mix and smoke those as I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when one runs out, I grab more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about where I get them from in
just a moment, but also Mike we'll go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and buy a couple of grams of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked about Mike's dab habits
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes dabs for ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think GI Joe may be happy with the size
of a dab that Mike takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: GI Joe would still be like, bro,
can I get a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And GI Joe is three and a quarter inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike likes a little tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike will go buy a couple of grams of
concentrates and he won't smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take him a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll bring them here and try to get me to
help him smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel bad digging into his
concentrate like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't want to smoke a half
gram dab out of your jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, do it buddy, cause I'm not
going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'll go to the dispensary again
to buy flour and he'll get more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate just cause he's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he ends up with several jars of
concentrates and he's got the collection a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you say that you have got a wine
cooler available to yourself to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that when you go to,
Oh, I don't know where you're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you won't notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice that when I go to a dispensary,
a quality dispensary will keep their
[SPEAKER_00]: quality concentrates in a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them have purchased the,
it looks like a cooler where you would
[SPEAKER_00]: keep sodas or food type products on
display at a smaller store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like the big grocery store,
but like a convenience store, maybe where
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd get some ice creams or something out
of the gas station cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice looking coolers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look trashy, but they're
smaller than the big industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're nice looking and they open the
door and they pull out or they slide the
[SPEAKER_00]: door to the side and they pull out the
concentrates out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have the glass front is nice
and painted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got that cooler door that's nicely
painted with the apothecary logo on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then inside that cooler, they pop it
open and all of the jars are inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller containers and nicely labeled so
they could just pull out what they need
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll notice that they do keep them in
a cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the compounds in our concentrates
do volatize at higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is better to keep them at a lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will mention if you're going
to keep them in the cooler is make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they are sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get any moisture to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the crisper drawer,
that is an ideal spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put most of my concentrates in the
little spot where you can put cheese or
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs because I don't fill my fridge with a
lot of dairy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got all that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you swing the fridge open,
there's a little drawer thing that the top
[SPEAKER_00]: slides up and it's just filled with high
quality concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is basically my version of the
apocalypse reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my hoarder stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I've got concentrates and
seeds, everything else will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crisper drawer or that little,
the dairy drawer, if you've got one that
[SPEAKER_00]: slides up and down, that is a great spot
for the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure they stay dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the jar is tightly sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to be in there for a
while, maybe put it inside of another
[SPEAKER_00]: container, put it in a Tupperware,
then throw that in the crisper drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've said this about seeds before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were going to get something really
cool in the refrigerator and then take it
[SPEAKER_00]: out and open it and let it get to room
temperature and then put it back and open
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you do get the option of condensation
and moisture happening because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature change from moving it in and
out of the cool to the warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend if you're going to move it in
and out, just keep it out or leave it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get out what you need for the next
two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have those sitting on the table for you to
dab, then put the rest in the cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep taking it out and putting it
away, especially if it's getting nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool to where you can cause
moisture or condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know that moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it on a lot of the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take it out, it'll get frosty and
foggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you've got the opportunity to
get condensation in your concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of words to think about,
you guys, with very minimal notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track because
I'm fucking high and rambling from the
[SPEAKER_00]: orange Skittles dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've found my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in this same question,
as far as hash and rosin, do you recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: the freezer or the fridge for long-term
storage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some kids put the rosin in the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an expert or a connoisseur or
much of a consumer when it comes to rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody gives it to me, I will gladly
enjoy it, appreciate it, and dab the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I go shopping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like different consistency than the
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's Pedro rosin, I may reach into my
pocket and pull out some money for Pedro
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may trade him for some seeds,
but other than that, I'm not really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in rosin, so I don't have much
advice when it comes to rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's bubble rosin, if it's flower
rosin, I really, I just have to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my wheelhouse at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend the freezer for most of
the concentrates, again, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get condensation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just say the fridge and try to
keep it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find my place on the rest of
this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on, and it's a really
small font.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next piece, next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been smoking for about the last
seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel I've gotten to the point where I
don't feel the different effects from
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains, and it somewhat upsets
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really only dab now and every other
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if I'm dabbing something new
that's a heavy sativa or a heavy indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the only effects I feel are in my
eyes and how slow and lethargic I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the last time I had an
energetic high or felt any sort of effect
[SPEAKER_00]: other than just that stoned feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time and everything you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to say my name if either
question happens to make it to the show
[SPEAKER_00]: from your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, big shout out because your whole
email made it to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what to say about your
disappointment and your tolerance level
[SPEAKER_00]: other than to say maybe take a break for a
few days, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that a tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cannabinoid receptors, your terpene
receptors, they're fucking full,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let them dry out for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let it kind of get sensitive
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been playing with it too much,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go blind if you keep
playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've either got to take a break or
you've got to step up the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that you're not getting the
desired buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something in your body that
your body's just going, I'm tired of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are occasional periods in my life
where my body goes, you don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke so much this week, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking settle down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to enjoy the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make your body not enjoy this
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to feel something
uncomfortable because there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: things you need to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to hydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get some vitamins in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about some nutrients and some
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in a couple of days, when you fix all
this dumb shit going on with your body,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe, maybe this is worst case
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a medical condition that
your body hasn't told you about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you haven't identified something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe smoking is aiming at that medical
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said that if something hurts
or if you've got a problem and you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or you consume cannabis,
that your body and the cannabis have a
[SPEAKER_00]: talk and it goes, oh, your shoulder hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over here to the shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes your shoulder feel better,
but it forgets to get you stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes your knee hurts a little bit,
too.
So if you're going to get your knee hurt,
never use like those n숙akan to foam,
[SPEAKER_00]: like those pain medicines, you're going to
feel a lot like how I feel if you take
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got real pain and you take some
pharmaceuticals, those pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: make your knee not hurt that you had
surgery on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a painful knee,
you're going to get all fucked up because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have any pain for that to work
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis kind of does that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got to go to the doctor and get
your health checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea to go get your
health checked no how old, how young,
[SPEAKER_00]: how healthy you feel, go see what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tolerance break may be the first issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step up your dabs, step up your quality,
maybe the second move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, make sure nothing else is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all your blood work looking good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just time to take a weed break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that you're getting red-eyed
and lethargic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if that's a strain that
you're smoking, if you're getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: product from the same place all the time,
or if your body is just burned out on
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking cannabis, because those are like
the two least desirable effects when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need bright red eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then who wants to be lazy and
lethargic?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that nice energetic buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you smoke something,
a little more quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where you're getting your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to sound like a snob or
disrespectful or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like you know what you're
talking about because you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also maybe you're growing all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're letting it go long enough to
where it kind of starts to degrade and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting that more down of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing and trying to offer
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are, but come take
a dab of this orange Skittles batter and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if this one fucks you up and gets you
talkative and makes you energetic like it
[SPEAKER_00]: does me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pay attention to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make you like our own stoned little
science experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you borrow my whoop strap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how your heart rate goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how you sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll feed you, take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For science, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: For science.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question
sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got the first part of it
down pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The storage of the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get condensation,
but do keep them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as your tolerance,
you may have to take a little break,
[SPEAKER_00]: my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush out the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your brain and your body all started
fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out the filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's dirty them all up all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will feel good to clean out your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll feel really good for your mental and
physical health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if that's not what you want to do,
maybe step up the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and then also go to the
doctor and see if something else is
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's another idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you eating too much or drinking too
much caffeine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there too much sugar, too much caffeine
in your diet that's kind of overriding the
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught myself playing the juggle game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wake up and I would take two or
three dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about an hour later, when the
buzz wore off, I'd be like, fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my response was to go to Starbucks and
get a giant fucking coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I drank about half of that
coffee, I could feel my heart trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: beat out of my chest and my hands would
get shaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd get a little bit anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, fuck, I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way too jittery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd go take two dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about an hour later, I'd say,
fuck, those dabs wore me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crashing from the coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chugged the second half of the
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 30 minutes later, you're going,
holy shit, I can hear my heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go take two more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go take two dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're crashing from that caffeine
buzz and you're fucking stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I caught myself like just doing this
weird constant battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was giving myself like my body
was hurting and I was getting anxiety and
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I was I would lay down to go
to bed at night and I could feel my
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbeat in my toes and I could hear my
heartbeat in my ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that shit wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from the constant battle all
day of Starbucks versus dabs, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neither one of them were going to win,
but I was going to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cut out the fucking Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not cutting out the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cut out the Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut out all of the Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut out most of the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut out most of the crap in my diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did that, I noticed I started
getting ridiculously higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now that I'm not battling my dabs
with constant caffeine and constant sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to get a real serious buzz going
on and it lasts longer and it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be something that is fucking
up your buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Matt, thanks again for getting
me set off on a good ramble.
