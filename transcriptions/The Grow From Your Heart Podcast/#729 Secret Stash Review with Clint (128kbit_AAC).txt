this, unfortunately we have lost another
[SPEAKER_00]: member of the giant tall gentle dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a father, he was a husband,
he was a friend, he was a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was recently in trouble with the law

[SPEAKER_00]: Big hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big hug to the Dabbing Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we do have Clint here on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change the mood really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to step over here to camera one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's hard to follow, bro,
saying goodbye to a friend, but dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for lightening the mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedian, the lighthearted guy is
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am such a big fan of the podcast,
a big fan of you, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been friends for almost a
decade now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're telling them how old we are,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and thank you for supporting the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I don't expect all of my friends to
listen to the show, especially you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a serious hardcore weed grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not deep into weed culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not deep into weed culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that throughout the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are getting your your green thumb,
your feet wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes my friends apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I haven't heard the recent episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, there's a lot in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the show when you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to enjoy it, learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate that you're listening,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seven hundred and twenty nine
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But congratulations, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great to see the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the last time you were here was
number five or six hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was one of the double digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was on five hundred was the last
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was before video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first time that I've ever
got to put a voice and a face together on
[SPEAKER_00]: your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that the beard is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought the beard, the face looking
all shiny, showing that beard off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to remember to zoom in when I
edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out that shiny beard he brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I wanted to bring Clint,
not only is he beginning to grow a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, we'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the show progresses, that will come
in naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been helping out, been doing some
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's become really enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the word passionate
about the cannabis plant, about the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, also about helping with ivory
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being a bro, you've had my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've needed some help with some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've provided a lot of help and service
and bro ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I brought him on today is
we attended the secret stash, the groovy
[SPEAKER_00]: gravy secret stash seed exchange in
Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the sales pitch going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got stuff on my teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to keep talking or keep
recording right over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We attended the event together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also brought white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hosted the booth and I used Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used you as kind of a security and bro
ship and backup ship and customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike plays a very good customer service
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are learning the strains really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both know how to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to have them at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I would bring them to do a
recap of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
I've been talking about the event for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really cool event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just jump right into talking about
it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at a super cool location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that place was called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that place is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is that on Saturday they
cleared everything out of there and we put
[SPEAKER_00]: up probably 25 cool booths, a DJ on a drum
set and through a secret stash seed
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful venue in the rhino district of
Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secret stash was definitely an
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, not knowing exactly where it was
until the day of was kind of unique for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would, of course, know,
but they didn't tell anybody where the
[SPEAKER_00]: event was located until the day of the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would give you hints.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it was it's in Denver and then it's
going to be near downtown and then it's at
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhino district.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the day of the event,
they actually told us the exact address.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vendors got the address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think around eight thirty or nine is
when I got the text.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking the dogs and pulled up the
phone and had it after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a message saying,
hey, vendors, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it said, do not share this
address yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not giving it to the other people
until later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The attendees didn't get it until 11 and
it opened at noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they made it really easy to set up
because a lot of times I'll be walking
[SPEAKER_00]: into an event and everybody outside is
Ross DeGeoff, Ross DeGeoff, because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: six five with dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're an Irish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't miss me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the dunks on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all know that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody wants to talk at this
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I parked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parking was super easy because I got there
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the fans were there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The attendees got to park, carried my shit
in, set up my booth and got ready before
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys even showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I started my day in Broomfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to drive all the way from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree to not knowing where it is is
a little nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know where to get a hotel?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know how to plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to fly by the seat of your
pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how being a weed grower and a seed
seller has always been in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was but it was a beautiful venue and so
many good people and such a great vibe
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smelled great outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were cooking a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very acclimate conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just enjoyed the whole experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet so many fun people and so
many passionate people about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it has reinvigorated my love for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This event was cool because no offense to
the bigger events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to bash the Endo Expo that
didn't happen, but that was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger events to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Chris, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the Endo did not happen,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that event, you get people who have
no idea what they're talking about about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get everybody at that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big commercialized event.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Secret Stash, it was the people
that were there looking for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would come to the booth and they
would be like, do you have this pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this pack right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take it now today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see them have like a
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would go from us and then right over
to J.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: and get that sour diesel and then run over
to Masonic and get that Wilson papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were getting everything they
could from every breeder they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one guy is like, would you recommend I
shop with anybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, definitely go see J.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go hit Masonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he held up his bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a Masonic bag with J.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in it that I could see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you're already winning,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I listen to the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had a strategy already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he knew exactly where he wanted to
shop, who he wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to I want to go backwards a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed vendors inside food trucks and art
and culture outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had artists right in front of us,
like doing their oh, yeah, artists inside
[SPEAKER_01]: their craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was that was really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got to like talk with a couple
of the artists and tell them, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, it's really fun to watch you and your
your art.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the canvas would go from blank to
artwork and they would take down the art
[SPEAKER_00]: and put up another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, what are they
drawing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly the guy that they had
painted walked by and they had him hold up
[SPEAKER_00]: the painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's pretty cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that guy for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just a just a wonderful event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Groovy Gravy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be there next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody absolutely plan ahead about
this time next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the third one next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be bigger, better, better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will prepare better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the menu on a QR code because I
didn't want to waste paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never know how many menus to print out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like throwing them away after
the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a QR code.
[SPEAKER_00]: You scan it with your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that may have costed us a few
sales, but that's a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in Denver, it seems like
everything is QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough for us to be down on
ourselves for something that seems like a
[SPEAKER_01]: very like trendy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: People should have been ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that weren't, it seemed
like, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we probably could add a couple of
menus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were definitely from somewhere
smaller is the polite way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, such a good time, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such positive energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was in such a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times at these events,
you get hungry or something like halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the munchies because you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there kind of early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I had to get up and get there
and get set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have allegedly been there was a no
smoking event, but I may allegedly have
[SPEAKER_00]: had a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I had to do is walk out the back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were there were tacos and there
were vegan tacos, which is freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smelled all kinds of foods, anything you
could think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a food truck, a boot that had
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a massage booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Priscilla and the massage
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of great stuff outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to watch our inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of work on the list of the
people that we should give a shout out to,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we saw a bunch of cool people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to make a list and a note as the
day went on, but there were so many people
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was working with customers and
friends and I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the the event was a very like timed
event for the customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because they they had like an hour
allotment to come in and shop through
[SPEAKER_01]: every vendor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, because it kept people
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of different customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there was like five
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like five events almost.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, OK, everybody get out next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they bought tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew when they bought tickets,
they would get a one hour time slot to
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done to to follow covid
protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before this was booked before the
covid restrictions were released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was just to be safe and compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow Denver's weird restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think next year we may be able to
open it up and not do the the phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do to and also to limit
capacity of the building and to not
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelm the breeders and to follow covid
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Clint said, they give you they open
the door at noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to run through until 12 and then
are at one and they kick you out at one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from one to 115, it was really
nice because we got to regroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to reorganize.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're selling seeds that fast,
your organization gets messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to kind of take a drink,
hit the vape pen a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: reorganize the seeds, restack the
T-shirts, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go go use the restroom at other events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super nice to get to go pee once or
twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the event, I was drinking a lot of
water because I was yelling over the DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: all day, which was kind of kind of hard to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were we were having to speak up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were at the event, you know,
the the music was a little louder than we
[SPEAKER_01]: would have preferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Mike was horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Mike doesn't have a voice by about
two o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is his voice is still shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we didn't seem like we wanted to
talk, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just couldn't fucking hear you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I leaned in, like I was trying to
kiss you, I was just trying to hear you,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to hear a lot of people as
leaning in my hearing sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the drums for 20 years and that
DJ was killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a little loud for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a friend who I some people I
can't say their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wrote down the guys from upstate
New York, because that way we don't snitch
[SPEAKER_00]: on anybody, get any people in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never once, but a big shout out to those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the group that is doing all the
great work with the doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't give us a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have their business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were three or four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're from Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your name, but I'm sure
you're going to watch this because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a podcast ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then let's cover some of the breeders,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to reconnect with top dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't spend a lot of time with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to stop and shake his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much all that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to say hi to JJ from top dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got to talk to Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys saw the photos of Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz's booth was right next to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, got to hang out with Masonic smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to big Mace Uno.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Mace?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wish I could have hung out with Mace
and Daz both for a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a quick event.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people flew in and then after six
or seven hours of talking and selling
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or voices done, you just want to go
smoke and eat food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody was like, Hey, good seeing
you high five fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all just dipped right at six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was over a big shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Masonic smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following Masonic,
give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, his Instagram will get shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how he does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I finally got to meet our friend Colin
from sacred tree organic farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: him and his lovely partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they were both very great people,
uh, spent a few minutes with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought a lot of gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some free merchandise.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a bright, uh, entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them were great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them were just so happy to,
he took off to go to the ATM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just politely made conversation
with her and she was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was, they're both very petite folks
that they both got some t-shirts to wear
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the smaller sizes don't sell
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, let's just bless our
friends with these aerogenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a link to all the t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching this, this was a note
for the end of the show, but Clint just
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a good segue.

[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the month of April, uh,
where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, gingerbread, big shout out to our
friend, gingerbread, gingerbread made a
[SPEAKER_00]: promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to gingerbread for a
while and they delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought me a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't talk too much about it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some new flavors coming in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I want to give a big shout out to
somebody who's been supporting the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you'll remember this
person until I described them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this person was named reggae in my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super energetic, positive vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I made a friend that day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a Patreon supporter and a podcast
friend for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day I made a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shook hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hugged, we looked each other in the
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a true bromance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy will be our friend for the rest
of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we need anything in Denver,
bro, all we have to do is type in the
[SPEAKER_00]: words, uh, reggae in my head on Instagram
and send a message that says, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen to that guy has got our
backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of the coolest, I already said
these words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most positive, energetic, loving,
uh, the dude's gotta be our age and he
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't stop dancing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had so much energy bouncing around,
just jumping, smiling, high fiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was on his way to go see a reggae
concert at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to that guy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an honor to meet you as an honor to
actually share a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came at just the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the booth is real busy and I
don't get to really connect with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try, but when there's a line and I get
busy, I try to connect with everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: briefly and move you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, reggae in my head, we got to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for repping the merge, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed up wearing a pink irie genetics
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I saw the dude all the way from
across the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, he's going to make a loop and
he'll come to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sure did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something I was going to bring up
was how many people would be walking past
[SPEAKER_01]: and see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their eyes lit up and they just like,
we got to get to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of my favorite parts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was talking with Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, somebody watch this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch this group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch, watch these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, they would see you and just
light up and like, that's where I got to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your community is solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the crew, but we advertised
heavily on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they knew to come and they knew,
uh, they knew what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if we would have had that menu
printed on the table, they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten more seats from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of stuff you guys missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned, we learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of my favorite things about this
event, this was our first time out since
[SPEAKER_00]: the restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my first time out at an event where
we could actually connect with people and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like we're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see some old friends,
uh, Josh from La Plata labs, the guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: gave us the tremendous gifts, man,
I am, I liked that guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time I got to meet him.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a, what a positive bright,
just the vibes, the whole, everyone that
[SPEAKER_01]: came up to the booth had great intentions,
but there's just those people that you
[SPEAKER_01]: realize like, man, I need more of that
energy in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had time that night, we would have
gone and hung out with Josh and gone to
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever party he was going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we would have ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, make sure you check out La Plata labs,
La Plata seeds, that Durango OG is the
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, good friend of mine, really good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Josh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to reconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the dude's got some big plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I'm getting the fuck out of
this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just smiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I hope you didn't hear that kombucha
in the voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there it is again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stop eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not even edit that part cause
Clint's laughing at the kombucha burps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, you know, we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm so happy to be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy to connect with your audience
because it's, I I'm on the discord as tall
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, when you guys see that,
just know like, I'm, I'm here with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this community and, um,
it's, it's been such a great thing in my
[SPEAKER_01]: life to, to have people like, like Jeff
around the, the positivity that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I try to bring and that I received
from Jeff is a, is a big thing in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big positive in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friend Cliff Ravenscraft taught me
and he learned it from Michael Hyatt.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it's always important to reveal your
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Cliff Ravenscraft taught me that you
become the sum of the five people,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you surround yourself with the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you, Mike, my girlfriend, and
probably, uh, accidentally my mom is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like to hang out with mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's, you know, she ain't going to be
there forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to invest as much time as I can with
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your mom's a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's my favorite person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell my girlfriend, she's my favorite
person, but mama, you, you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and babe, when you hear this,
that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you, Mike, my mom, my girl,
and there's one other person I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: probably rotates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably rotate that fifth person out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the discord crew collectively is who
that fifth person would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but bro, you're one of the five
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't surround myself with shit heads
because then you become a shit head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you surround yourself with five
CEOs, five millionaires, you'll figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to be the CEO and the millionaire
surround yourself with five positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: bad motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be, you'll be a positive,
bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey man, that's all we try to be is just
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that we're spreading that
especially to you guys and that you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: will take that and try to be positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's just today, I can testify
that the comments already on the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, they feel the positivity,
they feel the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they mentioned the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things they talk about
is the positivity and the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sending it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with these shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this is going to end up being a 45
minute show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaren, Jaren, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to run into Jaren from new
millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were passing out boxes of
nutrients with random prizes and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much cool shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it I can't mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big up to Oni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oni seeds was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kim Blackburn
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been trying to link up for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brought me a great gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, special big hug to a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Katie Ann Peterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where she came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw her randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like right about there suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just threw my arms up like,
you better come give me a hug before I
[SPEAKER_00]: could finish the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a hug in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: She threw her arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I have to go give Ross to Jeff
a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Katie's a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran into each other probably at an Adam
Dunn event years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she was working at the, uh,
the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the Adam Dunn's clothing line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, the hoodlum, him hoodlum.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was working at that booth and I met
her there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she's been at all the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a cool person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I hope you're well also a big
shout out to Priscilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: The massage lady made friends with her
when I was working with the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know her from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she's always been a great friend,
a good connection in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope she's well, the massage lady
van.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where it gets fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheesecake guy, dude, did you see all
those cheesecakes at the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in that place had a cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody said they were the most amazing
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Bubba's cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think it's a couple, a partner,
team, whatever business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there were, there was a male and a
female there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would assume, but you should not
assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I spoke well with the dude that was
making the cheesecakes and serving them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we got some plans in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, um, how about this bad motherfucker
that's on my list?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hanging out and I heard the voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard the voice before I was like doing
something with another customer and I
[SPEAKER_00]: heard the voice and I looked up and I was
like, that is Scotty motherfucking real.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun running to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we took a couple of selfies together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for him to come over and just be
as, as gracious with his time as he is,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's, he's such a, I keep saying the
positive light, but that's all I see out
[SPEAKER_01]: of this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like just his smile is, is contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's such a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he brings a different energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's recharging energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a big shout out to a
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen this person in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That possibly they could show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that they would be there
when they showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am super huge friends with Maddie
from the garden of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't seen Maddie in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The restrictions got us all weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she lives kind of further away than,
uh, she used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good smoke buddy, a good dad buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I love her dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she's a super cool friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard this voice and I looked up and
I was like, I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there she was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just gave her a big hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's up, Maddie?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen you in so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we got to talk about her dogs and
growing weed and all the shit we used to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mr. For a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, uh, Clint kind of covered this a
moment ago, but I owe a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend, Groovy Gravy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I call him Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, bro, great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one thing to, uh, voice my concern
to you honestly was the music was too loud
[SPEAKER_00]: and my voice is harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe I'm too fucking old,
but other than the music being too loud,
[SPEAKER_00]: that event was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parking was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entry was great for the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entry was great for the attendees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sales were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price of the booth was fair for the
amount of money that we left with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the ratio there worked out paying the
crew and paying for the booth worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a Wolf and his staff were very
attentive when I attentive, attentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid a lot of attention to me when I
got there, they made sure that I got to my
[SPEAKER_00]: booth, had what I need, made sure I knew
where everything was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pointed out the bathroom,
told me where the cheesecake was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they covered all the, all the bases
right when I got there, uh, good
[SPEAKER_00]: communication all the way through,
uh, from the minute he told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute I paid to the day of the event,
we talked every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, big up to my buddy Wolf and the
groovy gravy crew for throwing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it was a perfect event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could not have been, uh,
there was no hitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It couldn't have gone any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cool crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just, uh, and, and they were checking
on us throughout the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like combine the breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, are you guys doing okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just come by and give me the thumbs up or
thumbs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he didn't want to interrupt us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just give him a thumbs up and a nod
like fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're good, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like meeting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to make sure to give this
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I apologize to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have not put on this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is a minimal time to show,
and we were blazed during the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't spending the entire time taking
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're a breeder, a consumer,
a friend, a member of the IR army,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I didn't mention you here is your fist
bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it goes, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've got a couple of cool things we
want to talk about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did the BET awards here and
shouted out everybody in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, special thanks to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike isn't here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike lost his voice, uh, being such a
customer, a good customer service
[SPEAKER_00]: representative, telling people about the
strains, uh, the lines of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost his voice by 2 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still thugged it out the rest of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to Clint for being a bad
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call him security.
[SPEAKER_00]: He carries shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stands there and looks stuff,
but he's learning a lot on how to help
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really Clint's forte.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not the customer servicey,
uh, sales rep guy, but we're getting him
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on these strains, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got, there's so many intricacies in
these strains that I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's why I say I I'm happy to,
I love growing weed and I just don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: the nuances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people are asking questions,
it's like, well, boy, golden go to
[SPEAKER_01]: daybreaker, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the answer most of the
time, but, and half the time they just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk to me anyway, because I know
like I've been growing these plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than I should admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got relationships with the golden
goat plan, with the strawberry fields
[SPEAKER_00]: plan, with the tangy plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know those, the P 91, I know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown them so many times that I know
what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you cuss at it, I know how it's
going to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed it straight urea, I might know
how it's going to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know what they're going to do
because I messed with them so much and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so much data from my,
my crowd that I know what they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can tell you about them so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like talking about my own kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get a lot of data from your crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, such an important part of your
community that maybe they don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how, how much that helps in, in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the feedback they send.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say this one smelled like
blueberries or this one smelled like feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I don't take just one person's word
for it, but a lot of people will message
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I start compiling a database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, the convergence will say a lot
of people say it smells like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: spicy fabric softener sheets or spicy
dryer sheets or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I hear the word spicy multiple
times, that's definitely an accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one guy says rotten mangoes,
I won't include that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if two or three people say,
smell like rotten mangoes, I will say
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a phenotype that could smell like
rotten mangoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to include the data,
but data is also in the weed community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to like exclude and be really
filtery with data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love and hate the internet
forums because people can type whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data, you guys, thank you for the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out and I
covered the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered the people we met there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, here's where I want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys on a previous episode,
I did read a message about making auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said that auto flowers are not for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have nothing against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breeding, developing my lines
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to relearn how to breed
autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know a guy that does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls himself Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little company called night owl
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happened to have a booth right next
to our buddy Daz at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he may have passed me a bag of some F
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you what they are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm allowed to divulge
those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I was given a bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are labeled golden goat cross to
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds will be photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find a keeper female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I may return that, uh, female keeper
to our friend Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is you guys demanded there are
auto flowers of some, I read genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent a clip of that video to our friend
Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz has replied, there are auto flowers in
the making.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some iry owl, some night
iry, some night army, some iry owl,
[SPEAKER_00]: some night owl, iry genetics collabs
coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, um, do not rush this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, this could take at least a year
and a half to get, we got to get to at
[SPEAKER_00]: least, I think in my understanding,
we got to get to the F five or F six
[SPEAKER_00]: before we've got reliable autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could take a year and a half,
two years to get there, but you auto
[SPEAKER_00]: nerds, it is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I really wanted to talk about at
the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I saw a lot of breeders with different
approaches to customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the polite way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let seed sellers intimidate you and
try to take your money without giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: the product that you are satisfied with
and the information you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully grow that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I love talking about my seeds because
I made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the minutia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the nuances of each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the parents of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the parents of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably researched their great
grandparents and their great grandparents
[SPEAKER_00]: on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of what I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not shy about it because it's like
talking about my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to talk about little Jimmy's and
soccer practice and fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making shit up, but I can talk
about, I do have a Jimmy, but not a kid
[SPEAKER_00]: named Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not even edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, um, I really love talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a seed seller isn't excited to talk
to you about his stuff, to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: details about it, that makes me skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me, and I'm not calling anybody
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying any names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying when you go to the booth,
there should be info.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be details.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if a dude's got a bad look on his
face, that bad look may be in his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if he's got bad energy, that may be in
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, we've been standing
there since 10 or 11 today and talk to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give us a grain of salt and also a
bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got one to maybe a dab,
if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, the sellers should have info.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get all the details you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't bullshit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't feel rushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't feel like you're bothering
anybody by asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, get the info that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the sellers intimidate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them just take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them rush you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I, I've talked about this a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of myself for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done this now at multiple events.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will approach my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the people around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I invite that come say hi,
come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at an event and you tell me
later, I saw you and didn't say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to message you and let you know,
bro, come high five me and fist bump me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of times this has happened at
my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have come up to me and they're
like, Hey, do you have this cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: One time they were asking for roadkill
skunk or something super skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I didn't offer exactly what
they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy had money folded up in his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's like looking for the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be that quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have what he was looking for
that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that my friend who had a booth
right across the way was offering a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, dude, I don't have that,
but that booth right there has got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go over there and say, Hey, Rasta Jeff
told me to come over here and ask you for
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have it on the menu,
but I know he's got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a pack of it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd love to make your money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just ask him for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went over there and he bought those
seeds that he wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have taken his $300 for that pack
of seeds and given him some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But next year when he needs seeds,
who'd have been like, man, that guy said
[SPEAKER_00]: this was skunk and it smells like
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's got two new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can rely on to say, I don't offer that,
but that guy does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made friends with me and the other
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the right guy's got the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right guy's got the right seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe hopefully somebody will walk up
to another breeder and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have something that smells like
watermelons and strawberries and grows
[SPEAKER_00]: real tall and makes good hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll go, Oh, you should go get
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starburst from Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the karma works that way at this
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me if I had sour diesel BX
three, I just laughed and shook my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy, that guy right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got exactly that on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $300 a pack, but it's right over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he walked over there and he bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got exactly what he wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't sell him oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to grow it and he's going to
get sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not going to grow it and get fucking
oranges and berries like my product
[SPEAKER_00]: probably would have given him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, trust the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of mentioned that, um, this is the
way I describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having a reggae band,
a bluegrass band, a death metal band,
[SPEAKER_00]: a techno band, a fucking Norwegian fucking
folk metal band, all lined up next to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them will speak to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them will definitely make you walk
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of how the booths are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get vibes from all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into reggae, you'll come to my
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into Norwegian death metal,
you'll go to that booth over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're into Mariachi music,
you might go see my boy, Mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Mace?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you're going to have to find the
vibe that you roll with and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust your breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to contact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe that's contradictory because I
get 3000 emails a day and I don't answer
[SPEAKER_00]: them all, but be, try to be able to
contact them, have somebody that will
[SPEAKER_00]: answer questions that supports the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't just suck up your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part here, Clint, you're ready to
talk about this part on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the highlight,
the encore of the show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, this is, this is my favorite
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's, uh, you want to tell me,
you want me to tell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope Jeff this last season, I do an
outdoor grow in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, I was able to help,
uh, with the moon tower and, oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: just, it rolls off my tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said help with the moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint was standing in the room when King
Solomon was shaken to spread the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the pre-98 Bubba Kush female in
Clint's greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Clint was more than involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint was fucking right there next to me
as pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint was just as involved in that
greenhouse as I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint made the moon tower seeds right
alongside me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I did the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose the plants to put in the room,
but Clint, uh, was at that greenhouse as
[SPEAKER_00]: much, if not more than me doing the hard
laborious work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was the, the manager, the guy in
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking got some sneakers dirty out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit of a sunburn in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, got spiders on my legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but dude, you did a lot of work and
Clint was heavily involved in making the
[SPEAKER_00]: moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was fun watching and a couple other
strains out there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really fun watching Clint sell
seeds that he made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just see him like, ah,
yeah, he couldn't see, he didn't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable telling people at the time,
but I could see he's like, I made this
[SPEAKER_00]: moon tower pack you're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just see him like proud and
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was every time I heard moon tower,
I knew those came from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a hand in this and it made me feel
spectacular and it still does because now
[SPEAKER_01]: I know going forward, I'm going to see so
many moon tower pictures on our discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's just one of the,
the small pieces of this industry that I
[SPEAKER_01]: get to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, and so as, as the moon tower goes
out and as more gets grown, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a rise above a cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I'm so proud to have something
to contribute to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel that guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a good job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great, it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds made it, the plants didn't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to doing it again next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are picking up your moon
tower this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, outdoor grows are coming
very soon and this plant, I got to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the Bubba Kush and I got to grow the Arise
and boy, what a great combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bubba Kush looked amazing,
smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, really all the plants that I got to
deal with this year were amazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that Bubba Kush I'm super proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Bubba Kush is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have forgotten about the Bubba
Kush, that old gassy coffee, stinky earthy
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: People moved on to the candy, uh,
the, the fucking donut smells,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cake smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I predict the Kush and the skunks will be
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job on the breeding on the moon
tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun watching you sell seeds that
you made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having such a good time being part of
this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun watching you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some people at the event knew who
everybody was.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Masonic walked by, their heads would
blow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Oni walked by, their head would come
back together and re-explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ would walk by and they'd shit their
pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the top, not all, but a lot of
the top breeders were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were there just hanging out,
didn't even have a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is wrong with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not give Duke Diamond a shout out
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should, uh, I need a Southern boy ass
whipping for not mentioning my buddy Duke
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Duke?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got to hang out with Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say hi to Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, freedom is great, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you back, uh,
rocking the events, but they're really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, uh, vendors there are breeders
there that weren't even vending,
[SPEAKER_00]: just hanging out for the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was such a cool community event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun watching Clint have no idea who a
lot of these people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, that's Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, who?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that guy made fucking
Dominion skunk, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, why does that guy have a long
line over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Oh, you mean Capulator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, you mean Cap, the guy that
wears a mask to every event when nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what the fuck he looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he works by himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him over there in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to a Capulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of the breeders that
I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are several that I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to look down the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who am I missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Mace and Oni and then fucking,
uh, Clearwater and then, uh, new
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium and then us and then Daz and
then, Oh, NBG, nothing but gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up T big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I have to stop trying to
do shout outs because I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking forget somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to feel like a real piece of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were there, thank you for the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came up to the booth, if you just

it for hyping me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She couldn't make it that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted you guys to get to hang out,
but, uh, she couldn't make it to the event
[SPEAKER_00]: next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will be there showing some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, we have been going for 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I wanted to knock out a 45 minute
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd like to give you the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more left to say,
you got a hot mic in front of you and you
[SPEAKER_00]: look fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you want to tell the world anything
that's on your mind?

[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, uh, going forward like
this, I'm, I'm so excited for this grow
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I do an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of my stuff is just seasonal and I
am so excited to do it again this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be 10 years of me growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's, you know, I don't,
I don't know all the players in the game,
[SPEAKER_01]: but boy, I appreciate y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why, uh, love hanging out
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of humble me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You balance me because, uh, I'm caught up
in all the players in the game and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
