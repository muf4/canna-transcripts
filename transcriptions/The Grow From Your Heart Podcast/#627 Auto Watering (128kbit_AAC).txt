[SPEAKER_00]: down to New Mexico and hang out some of my
friends take some dabs go see some Scenery
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the south always have a good time
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the New Mexico gang Where are
we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk about the main topic
of this podcast I got two messages Both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them were on patreon both of them were
within a couple of days of each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were both about the same thing So I'm
going to read both of the messages I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure the point will be obvious by then and
then we will talk a little bit about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the tricks They are asking for the
alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first message in today's episode
goes a lot like this It came from girls
[SPEAKER_00]: grow too and it goes Just like this it
says hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a question for you after the
kovat lockdown I'm ready to go on a real
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacation like far far away from the house
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you mean It says the trouble
is I can't be gone for more than three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four days max because of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably more than anybody know exactly
what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sympathize with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I empathize with you I feel for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the same club in the same gang as
you I would like to go on a vacation But I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be gone for more than four days
because I do know that by the end of that
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth day I no longer have plants,
which means I no longer have a business
[SPEAKER_00]: which means I no longer Oh, let's not go
that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not think about that But you are
absolutely correct within three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: days of leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to come back and water the plants
That means I get a fish weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can leave Friday got to be back Sunday
night Maybe I can push it Thursday Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday Sunday if I'm lucky But you are
absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get away because of the grow
It does keep us locked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does need to be watered So it says sure
I could plan a trip and stop the grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that But it would be a pain in the in
the ass and a huge production loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely Shutting down for any
amount of time can be a huge pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ass and a huge production loss First of
all, what would I do with my mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: if I were to shut down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done phenol hunts We've selected
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work well in our grow well for our
body well for our customers Well for our
[SPEAKER_00]: medical needs now we're gonna get rid of
that That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that and then production loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to need medicine when I
get back from my vacation So plus I need
[SPEAKER_00]: extra medicine to take on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a huge pain in the ass So it says
what are your thoughts on some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: auto?
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, an auto watering system would be a
great idea I do work in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities and when I take
over the commercial grows The first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I do is get rid of the bug and mildew
problems The next thing that I do is I go
[SPEAKER_00]: in and I build an auto watering system so
that we aren't paying people to hand water
[SPEAKER_00]: plants all day it can suck up the entire
day and a commercial grow watering
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of plants or We can spend two or
three days building an auto watering
[SPEAKER_00]: system And then for the rest of that
facility you press a button and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants get watered So yes, an auto
watering system is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have severe trust issues So I
trust literally no one to do any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work in my grow except for me I understand
that trust me I have my own personal grow
[SPEAKER_00]: where nobody touches anything but me and
then I'm in charge of commercial grows
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often where I have to trust people
to control that grow while I'm gone
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I go away for a week for a
weekend and I've got to just trust the
[SPEAKER_00]: crew there That is a little bit
nerve-wracking a little bit sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how you feel It wraps up with thank
you Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved seeing white Mike on the recent
episode You guys are always a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey girls grow to thank you for the great
message I'm going to talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about building an auto watering system
I'll make sure that Mike gets a high five
[SPEAKER_00]: and a fist bump for you before we get to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read one more Message this one comes
from coach Steve and it says I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a question, but I would like to hear your
Details on an auto watering system
[SPEAKER_00]: components timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a handy, dude So I've got a general
idea, but your insight could help me get
[SPEAKER_00]: this right the first time I like that
you're trying to get it right the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time because when you're building an auto
watering system You absolutely could make
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge auto watered mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just auto water the floor You
could auto water the ceiling depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: how things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could totally fuck this up So I'm glad
you're trying to pay attention and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: right The first time wraps up with I just
finished my last run of organics and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm ready for a Ferrari Cocoa and
synthetics has me all excited so much love
[SPEAKER_00]: and respect to you from coach Steve
Alright coach Steven girls grow to this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a great question a great thing to get me
ranting on here on the podcast So I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna take a quick sip of some water and
then we're going to talk about building an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto watering system for our plants so
that we can sneak away for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days or maybe Use the auto watering system
to more consistently water the plants also
[SPEAKER_00]: water those plants every day so that we
can dedicate more time and energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on other things like defoliation
popping twisting sweeping Vacuuming
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning all the random shit that has to
happen in the house and in the grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of gets overlooked Because we're more
focused on the super important parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow I'm gonna take a sip and then
we're gonna talk about building this auto
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being patient with me while I
hydrate I either Edited that out or you
[SPEAKER_00]: watched me take a drink big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about building an auto watering
system Building a system for auto watering
[SPEAKER_00]: will vary based on how many plants you
have How much water you're trying to use
[SPEAKER_00]: and how big your grow space is that's
going to be the main Deciding factor on
[SPEAKER_00]: building an auto watering system for a
small grow for a small personal grow they
[SPEAKER_00]: do sell pre Fabricated auto watering
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with all of the tubing You will
need to get that water to your grow area
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it comes with little extenders to get
the water to the plants if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: small grow that will work however,
I always recommend even with The homemade
[SPEAKER_00]: or the purchased kit for an auto watering
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will always recommend having a backup
pump on hand Those pumps are designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: move water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them aren't designed to move water
with nutrients in them So or in it so
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pumps are going to burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get hot They're gonna get
used a lot and they're going to cook one
[SPEAKER_00]: day when you least expect it and it's
probably going to be at the worst time So
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what auto watering system you
choose to build buy purchase work with
[SPEAKER_00]: complete I highly recommend a backup pump
Whatever pump you get get another one just
[SPEAKER_00]: like it if the package comes with a pump
buy another one That's just like it or
[SPEAKER_00]: better so that you've got a backup if
you're gonna build one with the Monte pump
[SPEAKER_00]: that I talk about Get two of the Monte
pumps So let's talk about building a
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system The main thing you're
going to need the main things you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to need are a reservoir How much water
will your plants need for the duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: time you tend intend to be gone from your
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you water the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I water about every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I water about five gallons of water per
light every three days So now I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm gonna be gone for a week,
that'll be two waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to need approximately Ten
gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll need a reservoir that will hold a
minimum of ten gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be gone for a little longer
I'd like to buy myself a day or two on
[SPEAKER_00]: each end of that just so I can Maybe I'm
maybe my flight gets delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something terrible happens and I've
gone longer So I'm gonna try to go for
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 12 to 14 day reservoir,
which means I'm going to need Probably
[SPEAKER_00]: three maybe four waterings in there
probably 20 gallons This is where you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to decide what size reservoir you want to
get I like a Rubbermaid trash can or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Brute trash can I get the 30 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a 32 or a 30 I'll get the big
trash can and they sell wheels for it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardware store Right next to the trash
cans will be wheels that snap onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of your trash Can it the trash can
sits on it you turn the can now the wheels
[SPEAKER_00]: are secured onto the trash can I would
take some duct tape and tape that bitch on
[SPEAKER_00]: there just so you never have any accidents
But tape the wheels to there now you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a reservoir on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can roll that to your water supply I
don't know where your water supply is
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe It's far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's right next to your girl But now
you've got a reservoir on wheels that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can roll to the water supply roll it right
back to where you need it Another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna recommend I'm gonna back up a
step at the local hardware store If you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in your home, you've probably got
a shower or a sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get water to that big
reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a spout You don't have a
hose something I've discovered that is
[SPEAKER_00]: very friendly very easy to install very
useful for many different reasons I use it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of different things they sell a
device that is used to Wash your dog at
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your shower comes out of the wall It's
got the normal shower spout and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: head screws on to that spout to install
this new hose You unscrew the shower head
[SPEAKER_00]: put in a coupler and screw the shower head
back on now Your shower is just like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was except it's about three maybe four or
five inches longer If you're a tall guy
[SPEAKER_00]: like me now, it's closer to your head that
kind of sucks But you'll deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be worth it So you add this device
that adds a coupler and an extender in
[SPEAKER_00]: that extender Is a little piece that you
screw in another hose and that hose has a
[SPEAKER_00]: long hose with like a shower head on it
with an on and off spout so now you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a shower head that you can move around in
your Bathroom wherever you need to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to you can use that hose to fill up your
buckets You can use that hose to fill up
[SPEAKER_00]: your reservoir You can use that hose to
clean off things that you can't move
[SPEAKER_00]: around as well You can get that hose to
the things instead of getting the things
[SPEAKER_00]: to the shower if that helps you Maybe
you're a smartass and you've already got
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the showers with the heads that
comes off and you're using that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to shower with the same head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stuck in the five gallon bucket So I
bought the dog cleaning shower kit and it
[SPEAKER_00]: works beautifully for filling reservoirs
filling buckets and cleaning shit Make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you use the plumbing tape when you do
it Take off the shower head put a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing tape on the threads put that new
attachment on put some plumbing tape on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shower head put this shower head back
on you're almost ready to go now you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a middle piece that Receives that
extra hose piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just pop it off put it back on
it will I honestly just leave it there
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangling down all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could fill a bucket fill it Reservoir
just about any time it's got its own off
[SPEAKER_00]: and on switch to which I really like
that's a long ramble for that piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment Get that little bitch then get
your trash can get your trash can on
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels feel the trash can up now Here's
where we're gonna start building an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system This is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be kind of vague kind of
generic, but I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your grow space looks
like I don't know your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your skill level This is just
gonna be a vague idea for everybody so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can get a Good start at building
an auto watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to start with the reservoir
Like I've said before how often do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to water those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many waterings do you want to get out
of this water and reservoir get the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate size res?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the trash can on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the trash can on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill it up I put my nutrients in there I
adjust the pH and I adjust the I make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: the EC is where I want it I've got
everything right in my water now another
[SPEAKER_00]: really good idea is to have a stirr pump
in the bottom of your reservoir imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: that nutrients or sit that nutrient and
that water is sitting in solution for Five
[SPEAKER_00]: ten fourteen days all the heavy shit is
going right to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the light stuff is going right to the
top So when your plants get fed next time
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna get fed all the heavy
elements Whatever is heaviest calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium or the heavy ones They're gonna
fall to the bottom your plants are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get all of that on this feed and then the
next subsequent feedings It's gonna taper
[SPEAKER_00]: off until they just get plain water and
the lighter elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put that stirr pump in the bottom Of
your reservoir plug it in have it
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly stirring your nutrients
constantly stirring if you can if not Have
[SPEAKER_00]: it come on when you trigger the timer to
pump the water, which we'll talk about in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future I would recommend having that
water moving constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it getting stagnant and
stale I will get funky and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: feed your plants just the bottom the thick
part of the Kool-Aid You got to stir the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kool-Aid so all the drinks taste good So
you've got your now you got your your fill
[SPEAKER_00]: method with your dog washing Hose
attachment you got your reservoir on
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a mandi pump to start in there,
which is gonna be the base I know we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a stir pump in there stirring up our
nutrients now the next thing we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: work with a mandi pump I'm talking about I
like to buy the mandi pumps I cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: remember exactly how many gallons per
water or what the horsepower is on that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking thing Find the pump that is
appropriate for you too much water
[SPEAKER_00]: Movement is better than not enough because
you've got to push this water through a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of tubing and it's got to get
through some emitters if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pressure when it gets to the
emitters they just trickle and dribble we
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to kind of emit and spray and make
a nice pattern so Get a pump that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit bigger than what you think
you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the mandi pump It's usually just
about less than a foot tall just weighs a
[SPEAKER_00]: few pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a long cord on it So you're gonna
get the mandi pump and then you need
[SPEAKER_00]: tubing to go from the pump and the
reservoir To your garden area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your reservoir is gonna
be stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your pump will be
stored You'll probably need to be near
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity because you're gonna have to
Plug in a timer and a couple of plugs for
[SPEAKER_00]: this So put your reservoir in a good spot
then have it near a plug You're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need to plug in at least that stir pump
and then you're gonna have a timer with
[SPEAKER_00]: another pump on it and that timer will be
set to water at the intervals in which you
[SPEAKER_00]: tell it maybe you've got one of those
Amazon smart plugs that you can tell pump
[SPEAKER_00]: from far away Maybe you've got something
there are a lot of ways to set this up You
[SPEAKER_00]: can set it up on a smart B unit with a
moisture sensor in your pot when that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture sensor says Hey, this is too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will trigger the smart B unit to
actually water your plants There are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of ways to set up the triggering of the
watering a real easy way to do It is to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on a timer and tell it every morning
at nine o'clock water for 45 seconds or
[SPEAKER_00]: two minutes or however long it takes
They'll come on the water then it'll shut
[SPEAKER_00]: off There are timers you can buy to do
just about any sort of program you want
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell every Wednesday come on every
Wednesday and Friday come on set the timer
[SPEAKER_00]: how you want it So you're gonna need a
timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your main pump that goes inside
of the reservoir Then you've got flex
[SPEAKER_00]: tubing that comes from your main pump that
goes up and out of the trash can or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever Reservoir you've used back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run it across the floor if I'm using
tables I run it along the edge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tables and most personal grows You're just
gonna do the floor or however your tables
[SPEAKER_00]: or your plants are raised Anyway,
I'm coming out of the trash can down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor then I've got a line that goes
across the middle of the floor Then it
[SPEAKER_00]: separates into I make a loop out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain what I mean by making a
loop I don't want one straight line going
[SPEAKER_00]: down the room with lines coming off of
that to water the plants because The
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure toward the end will start losing
pressure and all the plants at the front
[SPEAKER_00]: will get the most water The water will
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take the path of least resistance So
I make a loop and the loop will equalize
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressure My line comes off of my pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a I use thick flex hosing I think
it's a three quarters of an inch maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: half inch in diameter But I'm watering a
lot more plants than you so get the
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter Of tubing you think will be
necessary to move the amount of water you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to move I don't know how big your
grow is Get the flex tube go from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Maundy pump out of the reservoir across
the grow room floor Then I will cut it and
[SPEAKER_00]: make a T intersection at this point So
there's a cap that goes on it and it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: T now My main line is coming out of the
reservoir and going straight across the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor to a T now I will build a square
I've got just a perfect square of tubing
[SPEAKER_00]: that lies right in the middle of my room
and then That perfect square just loops
[SPEAKER_00]: back to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a T that comes out and a square
I can't describe it any more simply my
[SPEAKER_00]: hose comes off straight Then it branches
out to a T and then it goes up and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back in So you got a straight line
with the square at the end of it the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for the square I've said this a
moment ago is to equalize that pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: this way We're going to get this same
amount of water flow through every emitter
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't get a couple of
emitters that spray real hard and a few at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end that are not spraying very Well,
I like the equalization by building The
[SPEAKER_00]: square it works very well for me and I've
seen it work better than just the one
[SPEAKER_00]: straight line So you've got your square
that goes along the floor measure it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're not gonna have to run a bunch
of spaghetti string to every plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: too long But every plant will need at
least one or two spaghetti emitters that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your Your pump in your
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your main line that runs out
across the floor to get closer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants You've got your big square laid out
in the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are now arranged around that
square This is where I use they send there
[SPEAKER_00]: are so many options for these products I'm
not sure where you're going if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna shop at a local hardware store if
you're gonna shop at the big orange box or
[SPEAKER_00]: the big blue box store I'm not sure if
you're gonna order it online There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great online website to order all of your
hydroponics parts, but I like to use
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little tool that you poke a hole
in the main tube with you just puncture it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there are spaghetti emitters that
are already pre-assembled that I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy they've got a barb on one end and a
long skinny tube and then at the other end
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a an emitter it is it hooks to
the One end hooks to the tubing and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of shaped like a question mark
or a half moon and what happens is the
[SPEAKER_00]: water goes up the question mark to the top
and then the water comes out of the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: and it sprays the top half of the question
mark and as it sprays the top half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question mark it makes the water spread
into an umbrella like pattern which gives
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants a nice wet even Consistency on
the whole top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna try to explain that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Monday pump Then we've got
main tubing that runs across the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to where the plants are goes into a
loop system I make a big square then from
[SPEAKER_00]: that big square I will puncture holes with
the tool that is sold if you go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardware store, it'll be in this
department You'll be able to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: puncture tool Then after you've punctured
the holes they sell little barbs that go
[SPEAKER_00]: into those punctures They fit perfectly
into that puncture you pop that little
[SPEAKER_00]: barb in there It's kind of a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your fingers are gonna be sore then
attached to that barb is what I call
[SPEAKER_00]: spaghetti line This is the actual emitter
line that runs to the plant then on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end of that is the emitter the water
the emitter connects to the Tubing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's got kind of that C It's a C
shape and that sprays out of the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it hits the top of the C It's got
a little cup up there that makes the water
[SPEAKER_00]: spray back down in a pattern also on that
emitter There are several different types
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find and buy a lot of them have a
stake that will fit Directly into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a metal barb that you push right
down into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the metal stakes Just like a just a
simple metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like us real thin aluminum fucking just
a piece of metal You don't need the big
[SPEAKER_00]: thick plastic pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to be super strong It's
actually easier and less damage to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant easier to get it in if you use that
skinny Just fucking little thin shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of aluminum It looks like it's about
the diameter of a piece of a stick of
[SPEAKER_00]: incense You could slide that really easily
into your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thick fucking a thick paper clip
Basically, so the emitter sits on that
[SPEAKER_00]: slides down into the end of the pot and
now it's just held in place By the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and by that stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic you've got your Your
reservoir with your mandi pump then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got your flex tubing that runs to the
plants Then you've got a T to build
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself a square You're gonna need a T
and four corners You can use PVC pipe for
[SPEAKER_00]: the big square, but I prefer the flex
tubing because you're gonna kick it You're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna bump it the PVC will break the flex
tubing is much more durable much more
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiving So you've got your tubing on the
floor, then you're going to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: puncture tool to make holes Then you'll
stick the barb in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll run the spaghetti line to your
plant You can put one or two emitters in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant depending on how much water you
want to get to that plant Sometimes I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have plants with one or two emitters and
then I'll have a big ass plant right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle with like four emitters Just
because I didn't plan well and that one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant needs more water So I got to put
more water in there now that is the Very
[SPEAKER_00]: basics of setting up a watering system
pump to tubing to a cube or a square to
[SPEAKER_00]: equalize the pressure To your emitters to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the basic setup There are many
options for parts and materials for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you've got to get what works best for
you Honestly during the pandemic parts and
[SPEAKER_00]: materials are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get what is at the store?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you're gonna want to buy
stuff and have it shipped do that if
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the way to go But try to buy what's
there so that it's in your hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what you're working with you see
All of the parts now once you've got it
[SPEAKER_00]: built and I know that was a very brief
description on how to build it But I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to kind of engineer the
details to work for your grow Here's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got it built you're going to
have to test it I said before it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to auto water the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to over auto water It's
really easy to under auto water So you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to get this tested and dial it
in a good way to do it pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: before you even build the auto watering
system how much Water does each plant get
[SPEAKER_00]: and how often that shouldn't be too hard
to figure out when you're watering your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants today Or tomorrow before you build
the watering system water the plant see
[SPEAKER_00]: how much it takes just before runoff Maybe
fill up a one gallon container pour half
[SPEAKER_00]: of it in there See if you get runoff pour
three quarters in there See if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff pour the whole thing in there See
if you get runoff see how much of that
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon it takes until you get some runoff
Inside of your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a weird microphone issue thing
just started moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, anyway Back on track see how
much water it takes to get that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: run off document that then the next thing
we need to do is Set up to grow the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system fill it up with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna have to put those
emitters somewhere I'm not sure how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna test this put them all in the plants
if the plants aren't already soaked Get
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the emitters and put it in your
pitcher Press go on that timer or just
[SPEAKER_00]: plug in the pump so that the pump starts
spitting out the water See how long it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to fill up that gallon of water
That's how long you're gonna want to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: that or however much water if it takes
three gallon or three quarters of a gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it fill up to three quarters of a
gallon time it see how long that takes
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how long you're going to want to
leave the timer on to water your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants need three quarters of a
gallon you put that emitter in a gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: an empty gallon Turn it on and see how
long it takes to fill that up now We know
[SPEAKER_00]: how long it takes for your emitters to
spit out three quarters of a gallon Go and
[SPEAKER_00]: put an emitter in every single plant have
them all set up and ready to go have the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir mixed up pH balance the EC is
correct Then when the plants are thirsty
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I would do it manually the first
time I would go in there and plug in that
[SPEAKER_00]: pump hit go on the timer and watch maybe
it takes a minute and 42 seconds Maybe it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes two minutes and 17 seconds But watch
it when the amount of time that you timed
[SPEAKER_00]: it is up unplug it then go investigate the
plants Are they watered enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they saturated are all of the plants
equally watered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you happy with the work now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to water longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to water shorter now the thing
to figure out is how long before my next
[SPEAKER_00]: water?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know that the plants need three
quarters of a gallon of water every 72
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you set it up to water for two minutes
and 17 seconds every 72 hours and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will get the most consistent most even
waterings Those plants have ever had and
[SPEAKER_00]: they will show you their gratitude They
will start they will start jumping on that
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule and you'll go Oh the plants need
water and then you'll hear the pump click
[SPEAKER_00]: on and you'll go bam We're so in sync.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's right on rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful thing to set up So
you've got to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dial it in Don't build this
system and then leave town build this
[SPEAKER_00]: system run it for one or two weeks while
you're there Watching it then leave town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need maintenance if you're
feeding big thick chunky Veg bloom powder
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need a filter in your
setup at some point So you've got your
[SPEAKER_00]: pump and then you've got a little bit of
flex tube going up They make a filter that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes in the water That way that will catch
all of the solids that haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved properly because those things
are going to clog up your emitters You're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need to clean the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to clean the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to clean the emitters What I
would do when I ran the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility every couple of days I'd get a
brand new baggie of the emitters or I
[SPEAKER_00]: would get the freshly cleaned emitters and
Walk the room and if I see one that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying properly I can unscrew it and
screw another one in while the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting watered and not mess anything up
too badly I would get wet and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: little spray, but it's a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at work That's how it's gonna go So I
just walk the rows and replace the
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters as I go and I'd have a bucket
full of deads and a bucket full of
[SPEAKER_00]: freshies that bucket full of dead emitters
would get thrown into a container of h202
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when somebody's got time they'll
go through and use a little pokey and poke
[SPEAKER_00]: all the sediment out of all of those
emitters and then we just keep recycling
[SPEAKER_00]: them and recycling until eventually they
do break when we poke them out because
[SPEAKER_00]: they get brittle from all the use but
maintenance make sure you clean the filter
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you clean the pump and make sure
you do clean those emitters because they
[SPEAKER_00]: will get funky over time You're going to
need to be mindful of the nutrients you
[SPEAKER_00]: feed through your auto watering system Not
all things are going to be good for your
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters and for your pump I've noticed
that some of the carbo load Carbonaria
[SPEAKER_00]: will absolutely clog the shit out of those
emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky So get that out of there if
you're gonna run that maybe run a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of clean water through the lines right
after just to rinse them out all So
[SPEAKER_00]: between grows make sure you're cleaning
all of your new equipment You've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new setup of stuff to clean out
between grows flush it out with some clean
[SPEAKER_00]: water Maybe run a cleaning product through
there Then make sure you clean it out
[SPEAKER_00]: really well before you feed the plants
with that system again But it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: require more upkeep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another step that you're gonna
have to clean Let me look down at my notes
[SPEAKER_00]: because I haven't looked at the notes in a
long time I want to make sure I got all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff barbed emitters lines and
emitters a timer You're gonna need a
[SPEAKER_00]: timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timer is going to be critical learn
how To set that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it before maybe the plants
want two minutes and 17 seconds worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: water every 72 hours You're going to need
a timer that will do that for you or one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those Amazon smart plugs Maybe you've
got a camera in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be ideal You've got some sort
of a monitor that tells you the VPD in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room Maybe a monitor that tells you the
moisture level of the medium cocoa soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're working with and a camera
and an Amazon smart plug then you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: a notification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you should water you can Look at the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right It's time to water and then you
can press a button on your Amazon smart
[SPEAKER_00]: plug and those plants will get their
Required watering and you can watch it all
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a glorious feeling being away
from the grow and watching shit happen I
[SPEAKER_00]: love watching the commercial grow go when
nobody is there Alright, so then Make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were adjusting pH before you
leave and make sure that that pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: staying where you like it Maybe experiment
maybe before you go out of town makes up
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients practice with This a bunch
of times but keep checking the pH and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how it swings because maybe it'll rise
Maybe it'll fall while you're gone water
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to evaporate Water is going to be
used the pH may swing You may have to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust your pH a point or two higher or
lower than you normally would To
[SPEAKER_00]: compensate for what's going to happen over
the next week while you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something people don't think about
Adjust that pH mix up your newts get your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH in there your EC, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those nutrients moving have that that
Pump down in the bottom of the reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: that pump can be attached to the timer
that triggers the feeding That will start
[SPEAKER_00]: stirring it while it's feeding I would
rather it be stirring all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I understand that's another pump
another plug That's more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe plugging both of the pumps into the
same timer will be beneficial would work
[SPEAKER_00]: better for you But still make sure you're
stirring your stuff Set your timer give it
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of test runs dial in what needs
to be dialed in and then let it rock and
[SPEAKER_00]: go on vacation with confidence and
hopefully Nothing goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen maybe I shouldn't tell you about
the shit that I've seen wrong I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters blow clean out of the lines I've
seen the pumps completely come undone and
[SPEAKER_00]: the water shoots straight up into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the pumps freeze I've driven 45
minutes in the snow on a holiday because I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched a pump freeze up as it started and
I knew that a whole Section of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial girl wasn't gonna get
watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to go rescue that That's a fun
story car broke down in the snowstorm
[SPEAKER_00]: during that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know Goddamn girl grow room
hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls pimps and hoes friends foes smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: growers trimmers Packagers the grow team
the lead growers the home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening
This was a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time doing this one I hope I
gave you the info which you were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for I know that this was kind of vague not
a lot of super in-depth details But you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to build this project on
your own pump tubing emitters There are
[SPEAKER_00]: pre fabricated setups available online
Maybe you can use those as a guide to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a sort of a guideline of what you need
to do What you do and don't want but I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope I gave you the info that you need I
want to thank you again for listening if
