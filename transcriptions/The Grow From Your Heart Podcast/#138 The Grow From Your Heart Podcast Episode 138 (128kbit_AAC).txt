[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 138 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat Kuth and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night, the Mystic Roots Band played
at the Black Sheep in Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was a great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I danced my ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sang my ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mystic Roots Band came out,
and they played their first song,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they dedicated their second song
to Irie Genetics and myself, and that song
[SPEAKER_02]: was Pass the Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to my friends in the
Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for putting on a great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for making me feel like a VIP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great ass time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, big shout out to Kachafaya,
and also a big thanks to everyone at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Sheep for letting us get down in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may have been some ganja smoking,
and nobody tried to stop us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much love and respect to the Black
Sheep in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kachafaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came all the way from New Zealand to
play in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: That band is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good time checking those guys out,
but I really had a good time getting down
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I saw you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we got a high five together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we got a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we got to shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we saw each other and had a great
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Smiles and the crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Jessica.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the wooks that I hung out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this podcast, I have my friend Will,
the barefoot grower over, and we also had
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob from Sour Seeds over, and we talked a
whole bunch about breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Fred Garvin sent me an email,
and he asked about harvesting his first
[SPEAKER_02]: seed crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fred is halfway through his first breeding
project, and he wanted a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: guidance on how to properly take down his
seeded plants, how to get the seeds out of
[SPEAKER_02]: there, how to store them, and how to care
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to give a long,
long discussion on pulling the seeds out
[SPEAKER_02]: of your seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get that far, you guys,
I want to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends at Elevate Glass in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need a new rig, if you need a new
nail, if you need a new dabber,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're trying to buy a brand new
e-nail, you can check out my friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're located at 517 South Tejon in
beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you let them know Ross and Jeff
sent you, and let them know that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would both appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you check out Elevate Glass,
517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm going to let this music play
for a couple of seconds, and when we get
[SPEAKER_02]: back, we will be joined by the barefoot
grower and Rob from Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World, we are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me at the table is my good buddy,
Will, also known as the barefoot grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the table, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, are you still blowing glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, kind of had to put that on
hiatus for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you change from barefoot blower or
glass, barefoot glass to barefoot grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the barefoot blower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a whole different type of podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also across the table from me is my good
buddy, Rob from Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we got Rob a little bit too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a funny look on his face,
but I think he's going to be all right in
[SPEAKER_02]: a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that Bill Cosby grin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might be the barefoot blower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not going to turn into the
Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get this back on the rails very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for coming to the table,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both these guys, we've been talking about
how busy we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sat here for an hour and talked about
how we don't have time for shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of funny if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about our friend,
Fred Garvin, sent me an email and he is
[SPEAKER_02]: halfway through a seed breeding project.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is his first run trying to make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants some guidance on how to harvest
the seeds, maybe when to pull the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and things to look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, shit, my buddy, Rob,
breeds a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I breed a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get Rob over to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will was coming over to hang out and take
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought a dope ass mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put you on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's got a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anywhere you'd like to start
with, bro, because you were looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing pretty intently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should start from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the moment, the conception,
basically, you know, when the when the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed starts, you know, when to pollinate
and how to pollinate, like the timing
[SPEAKER_00]: wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully you've got yourself a solid
male that we've talked about before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you came and talked about that
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully you've got a solid male.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your females chosen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it is time to actually breed some
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to pick some indica
plants, when should we start to pollinate
[SPEAKER_02]: our indica plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say between week three and four,
when your bud sets really start to form up
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time, I would say when they
get about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, good nickel to quarter size.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that way, that way you got plenty of
because because of what it's really going
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn me down on is how many hairs you
have, basically how many pistols you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're what carry the pollen
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually make the progress happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see the pistols nice and
thick, it kind of looks like you got some
[SPEAKER_02]: little spiders going on when those
dandelions, when the hairs in the
[SPEAKER_02]: dandelions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's such such obvious terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when those pistols get thick and
ready, that's when that plant is ovulating
[SPEAKER_02]: and it wants to receive that male pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your indica plants, you're
absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: About three weeks ish about day twenty one
to about day twenty eight ish is usually
[SPEAKER_02]: when I try to hit an indica plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica domina hybrids you can get away
with maybe sometime week four if it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bred out with a sativa or
something like that has a slightly longer
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you you just really have to use
your best judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but typically week three is
about the money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about if we're working with a more
sativa dominant plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go a little bit later,
you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really do want to get a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being because if you do to
do do a pollination too early,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get the seeds stock
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also might be sitting in the
plant for too long and the plant might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be ripe, but the seeds will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds will over ripen just like any
fruit or anything else out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can over ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them pop inside the bud before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually seen a seed germinate itself
inside of a bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now when you guys say indica and
sativa, you talk about the female you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using or the cross that you're trying to
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: The female that we're starting with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the girl that's going to receive the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Will's here to keep us on
track.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're always with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're we're definitely referring to the
female for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sativa dominant plants, you can
usually do a week, week four, week five,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually typically a week or two later than
you would an indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you really have to judge
flowering period if it's a nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: ten week sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want you want to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what you're leaving looking for
is about a four to five week gap of just
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants going through growth,
normal, regular, solid growth for about
[SPEAKER_00]: four to five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make that seed go from
start to finish and really finish out
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely from from start to embryo to seed
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: When should we put should we put our males
and females into the flowering room at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really depends on your
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody is worried about getting cross
pollination with other females and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that is to bring the female out of
the room or you use a smaller room like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like a small two by two or three by
three grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people even go down and use
something as cheap as a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard box like like something for a
refrigerator or like the largest box you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get at U-Haul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a CFL in it for your males,
you know, and stuff like that and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: them go and then throw the female in there
just for the day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to do its thing and OK,
you know, pull it back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's the deed is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it down with tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce it back into the flower room so
you don't cross pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the way I do it since I when I when I
pollinate, I do the whole room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even fuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I'm going to write the entire
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get that male nice and beefy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he's full of pollen and hopefully
I've got him timed up to where my girls
[SPEAKER_02]: are about three to four weeks in,
I just take him in there and put him in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of the fan and give him a good
shake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smack the sticks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pollen goes everywhere,
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's only if you're trying to do the
whole room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to time it and you don't
know how long your male plant is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take to start busting a nut, that's when
it's time to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I always harvest pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep good storage of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good way to store pollen is a good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you store pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use a very clean container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wipe it out with alcohol first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry really good and then wipe it
out with water to make sure there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to kill the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't use tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use an RO water or distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way there's no chlorine present,
so it won't destroy the pollen.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a dried rice is a really good
thing to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen growers use dried rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing is when you go to store
pollen is to make sure there's no green
[SPEAKER_00]: material left over or any kind of bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a very similar method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll collect the pollen from the male and
then I will have a clone of that male and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll flower him right alongside my ladies
so that I'm sure that right around the
[SPEAKER_02]: proper day I know that each of my ladies
will get dusted with the proper amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm double teaming it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of a weirdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be a cannabis hoarder because I
always like to keep a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case something goes wrong,
I've still got some of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know when you're going to come
across something and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one male would be really good with
that female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a new cut that you just got
right for the first time and you realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, wait a minute, if I would have had
that male or if I had that pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have just made a masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were saying, keep it in a clean
jar or a container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep mine in a clean, those little tiny
mason jars, like a baby food size mason
[SPEAKER_02]: jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I keep that in a brown paper bag
so there's no light getting to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I actually put that in my spare
refrigerator right next to my silver
[SPEAKER_02]: thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a reason for keeping it in the
fridge other than just like the light and
[SPEAKER_01]: protection thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cold is more preservative than
heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think things will deteriorate and
degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shit goes wrong more quickly in heat,
in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold slows everything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's you keep your food and your
meats and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't keep any meat, but I mean,
if you do, you keep that shit in a fridge,
[SPEAKER_02]: keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my... It'll keep your pollen
viable for longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also keep some seeds in a cooler and I
haven't seen any difference in the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have kept not in a cooler and in a
cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: My other seeds go in a safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a big gun safe filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds that were in the cooler,
I've germinated those with the same exact
[SPEAKER_02]: success rate as non-cooled seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know when to pollinate the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's going to take about five to
six weeks for those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the pollination happens, you'll see
the pistils curl up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they'll be clear looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're white.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of like clear, veiny white
tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that pollen hits, they're going to
crinkle up like claws, like arthritis
[SPEAKER_02]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to start turning brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know the pollination has
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the pollen is moving up the pistol and
into the ovule and you're now actually
[SPEAKER_02]: making a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about what to feed
plants that we're putting seeds into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give them a lot of carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give them a lot of carbs and
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good little bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all I really do to them other
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do give them a little extra nitrogen and
flour than I normally would because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's going to use a little bit of extra
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a mom would.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a baby inside of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to try to... She's going to
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got to eat too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to take that concept and relay
that into your plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those offspring you have...
[SPEAKER_00]: They need nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need food to be able to grow healthy
and strong just like a baby would or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely use as much light as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're breeding, light is definitely
helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll multiply your amounts of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you step up from a 400 to a 600 to a
thousand, you'll see the amount of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: you produce and the quality of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little white seeds won't happen if
you use a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only get those with a four or a six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you keep it on a 12-12?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually use sixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a 12-12 regimen when I go into flower
fur breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use 600s, but even like you were saying,
it will help mature faster with a brighter
[SPEAKER_00]: light source or hotter light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically what I do this time of year,
I take them and put them outside for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last week to ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the UV rays really take them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does it increase the THC and
bombard the plant at all at one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really looks good on the charts after
it's cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about making oil out of
plants that were seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about this in a minute,
but once the plants are finished,
[SPEAKER_02]: you take the seeds out and you've got a
bunch of material left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to take that material to one of my
good friends like Will that makes hash for
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concentrates that come out of that,
you get such an amazing high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get a psychedelic high,
but it is more of a psychedelic feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get more of a mind trip from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get more body high from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does something to the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly does.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what to feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we want to give them lots of carbs,
a little more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still going to have to flush just
like you normally would before you cut
[SPEAKER_02]: down the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to interrupt with something that
I saw on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't call them out, but hopefully they
listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They posted to Facebook, I found this stud
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to put him outside for the season and
see what he can do so that I can collect
[SPEAKER_02]: some pollen is essentially what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many bells went off in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that post.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody for four miles of this dude that
is growing outdoors is going to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid of whatever this dude put outside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wind and nature are going to do their
things and this guy's going to pollinate
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you've got a male plant,
don't put it outside so that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate Rob's outdoor crops and you can
pollinate everybody's outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please be a think full thinker,
a think full stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a for thinking grower is what I need
you to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put that shit out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are shaking their heads in
silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think they just want to stand up and
walk away from their table now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, fuck, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take a cry break if you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have taken naps on that couch over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a cry break would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants are going to grow about six
weeks until the seeds are ready-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should we start looking for during
that time period to know if the seeds are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting ready or if we're going to have to
let them go a little bit longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are what I'll do if there's
none.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll split and you'll
actually start seeing the seeds present on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the undersides of the buds where the
calyxes swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyxes will split.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll actually split and the seed likes
to protrude from it sometimes when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll actually see the visual seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a nice gray dark color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see nice tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black tiger stripes is what you're looking
for a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know you've got a nice ripe seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically want to look for no green
and no white.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the two things you
really got to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no green and no white and you
got tiger stripes and you got nice gray
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or dark seeds, typically you know
you're ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: A cheat move that I do after about six
weeks of pollination, five and a half,
[SPEAKER_02]: six weeks of pollination, I wait and then
right at the base of the buds where the
[SPEAKER_02]: stalk and the bud meet, there's usually
one little calyx that swells up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just pinch that fucker off and roll
it around in my hand and you'll know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: either a seed or what would have been a
seed had you not destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't worry about crushing one or
two of those because if you did this
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly, you're going to have at least
100 closer to 500 if you do it like Rob
[SPEAKER_02]: and I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've pulled 5,000 seeds from a plant
before easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at pulling like around at
least a thousand or two from one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was running seven gallon pots and
hitting them with big males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousands of seeds can come from one
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the hell were we?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long to let it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: What to look for?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pinch that one little ... You guys
will see what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a seeded crop and a lot of
times you'll see these little calyxes on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottoms of buds and they'll make you
think you've got a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to touch on letting them go a
little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens with the ramifications of
letting your seeds go too terribly long
[SPEAKER_00]: and not letting plants just basically go
into the point where A, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose most of your THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to convert over to CBD and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the progeny, in the bud that's
actually growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've ever had those
seeds, had a batch of seeds from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: or a reader that you've gotten in and
they're just hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got really great dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real dark, nice, but they're just
incredibly hard as rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have to be scored germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what it is is because the seed
is this embryo and it's developing a
[SPEAKER_00]: shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's developing a shell and the shell is
going to do nothing but like a bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get harder and harder and
harder the more you pump that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially it comes from not ripening the
plant correctly also, not flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, things like that because you've
got so many nutrients present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still telling it to drive,
drive, drive, drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to create that and develop
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also when you risk seed splitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed splitting will happen because
whenever you pull them out, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be so overdeveloped that once they
start to dry out, they're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking and splitting because there's
going to be such a large embryo inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: this shell because it's swelled up inside
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a lot of problems can
develop from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of the issues when people
have these little issues with seeds when
[SPEAKER_00]: they get them in the mail and things like
that from different breeders and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: cracked and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package is fine and they come great
but you got a couple of cracked seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they look great and everything
but you can tell just that shell split
[SPEAKER_00]: right down the side and you're like,
hey, this is not going to be good because
[SPEAKER_00]: the embryo is now dried out and dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed's toast and then you get some
that you have to score because they just
[SPEAKER_00]: will not germinate unless you score them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you'll know if the seeds are
super hard, really thick shell,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be able to tell by looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be extra glossy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be a little harder than normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's your first pack of seeds,
you don't have any thing to compare it to
[SPEAKER_02]: so you're just going to have to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to score them to
soften them up a little bit to get them to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a match book, that's a real
good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a match book, use the side of a
match book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rub them like that or really fine
grit sandpaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to use a coarse grit
because it's going to tear it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tear into it really hard so you
want to use a really fine grit sandpaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the easiest things really to
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to just soak those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a couple of drops of hygrosime in a
glass of water or a jar of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat away at the shell a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soak those plants for about 24 hours and
then put them in the paper towel and
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate like normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That usually works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one I use is Dr. Willard's Plant
Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never talked about that on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a free bottle of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy gave me a case.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 to 60 mils in your reservoir,
he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, how do you know how big my reservoir
is?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, it doesn't matter with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put 30 to 60 mils in here and it'll
make your plants go faster and it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see them absorbing more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a side by side with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took blueberry fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took about 10 of them, germinated them
with regular tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we germinated out of the same group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 10 seeds, Dr. Willard's and tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hour difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of those seeds germinated within
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the regular tap water took about 36
to 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a dramatic difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see it was overnight versus the
next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use it religiously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Dr. Willard's Plant Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send us stuff, get in
touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you leave them in there too long,
you guys, your seeds will start splitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your plants start dropping seeds,
if you have more than one female in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room and seeds fall out of your plant,
you can't just pick that seed up and
[SPEAKER_02]: assume that it came from this girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could have came from any of the
females in the room and it could have
[SPEAKER_02]: rolled to that spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't label that one what you think it
fell from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only label seeds what you're
fucking sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever guess when labeling a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the future of the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want any confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your job as a person breeding to take
beautiful notes for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I just had a crop and we
popped the seed out of it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes in the happy accident bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, happy accidents are a good thing when
you're in the seed business or the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't ever make it out to the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a really, really great idea where
it come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost like 90% sure where it came
from, but I still label the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just sew and put happy accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll pop that seed and it'll get a
whole new name and a whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it stays around, it could be the next
hottest clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be because more than likely it's
going to go in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the super popular shit was an
accident just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I try to explain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about selection and not numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pop a million seeds if you're not
good at selecting those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does a million seeds worth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I found some beautiful keepers
that most people would have just tossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can name 10 of the world's most
legendary strains right now that all came
[SPEAKER_00]: from five seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue number four.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Gainesville green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know enough about the Florida
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually did a whole episode about
accidents and clone only accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: East coast sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: West coast sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush, Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your job as a breeder, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please be careful to carefully mark
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you label everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make any mistakes for the future
because you're going to be growing these
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and hopefully some of your friends
are going to be growing them and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to mislead people on what is in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this stuff is going to be aimed
at medical patients and we want the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical patients to know the genetics of
what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really helpful.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you find some seeds on the floor,
you can use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to be careful and carefully
think about what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to say it's this times this
until you grow it and if you're certain
[SPEAKER_02]: then you could be cool with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an unknown, just label it an
unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some of the biggest,
largest breeders in the world label their
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics unknown crossed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage has a special name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage's number one male, Joseph.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Joseph male that they used for years
and years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bag seed male from somewhere and
nobody knows what it was so they just
[SPEAKER_00]: named it Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They labeled it properly as so and then
everybody knows that or we wouldn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually buy Gage's unlabeled
seeds and they've got a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what they're called.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the seeds that fell to the
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called good ideas is what his
extra seeds are called.
[SPEAKER_02]: He calls them good ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a good idea but I don't know what
it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back to our little breeding
project here for Fred.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got plants with seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've gone five and a half, six-ish
weeks since the pollen has hit them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pistols are curly and brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichomes are starting to amber up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are getting mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start flushing the plants and now
let's talk about pulling down the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting the seeds out of these sons of
bitches right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvest them just like I harvest any
other regular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it down, take away any water leaf,
anything, basically do a light wet trim
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I just hang them and let them
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them dry a little bit longer than
normal because they are seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a denser texture to them and
they're a lot more dense than regular
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already a rock so you got to
really let them dry out a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after they're done, you just
carefully roll them in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just carefully roll them and I just let
the seeds fall not from a high place but
[SPEAKER_00]: from a low spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six inches or lower above your table or
sitting tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you buy a package of ball jars or
Kerr jars, little mason jars, it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: with that cardboard base to keep them in
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to use that thing or go to the
liquor store and get something that they
[SPEAKER_02]: just put cases of beer in, just a little
flat one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about three or four inches deep and
the seeds won't bounce off the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, excuse me for clearing the throat
so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took so many dabs today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds won't bounce off the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to try to use a cookie sheet or a
Pyrex dish but then you take these buds
[SPEAKER_02]: that are filled with seeds and they're dry
and you crumble them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it right, you guys, it's going
to sound like it's raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds are going to come raining out of
these buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use cardboard because they will not bounce
as badly as they will out of a cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: sheet or a Pyrex dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually just, like you said,
let the buds dry and then I roll them up
[SPEAKER_02]: in my hands, crumble them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wear a rubber glove because you're going
to get sticky as shit, or don't if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like to get that resin all
over their hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Rusty, shout out to Rusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes to pick seeds without gloves and
be all dark-fingered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless I'm playing with cocoa,
I'm wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to play with the cocoa,
bare-handed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cocoa just cleans your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your hands are filthy, just go stick
them in the cocoa and mix them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hands will be shiny again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now we've got a bunch of
dried bud material basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the size of your garden,
there's a whole bunch of different ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: go and try to pull these seeds out of your
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention this while we're here
because we're all stoned and we might fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your female plants separate at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working with more than one
varietal, more than one strain of females
[SPEAKER_02]: in this breeding project, keep the bitches
separate because you don't want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have carefully labeled seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole part of why you're
breeding is so that you can know what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the girls separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you find seeds on the floor in the dry
room, once again, those are good ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't label those unless you're certain of
what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've got all this material.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a little crop, if your
garden is kind of small, you can simply do
[SPEAKER_02]: the old-school method where you put the
little container at an angle and slide the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed up to the top and the seeds will roll
to the bottom and the dried weed material
[SPEAKER_02]: will stay at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you a good tray, a good magazine,
whatever floats your boat, 45-degree
[SPEAKER_00]: angle, and a pack of rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some music and just go at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put all those seeds in a jar and let it
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cheapest, easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing it on a level to where
you've got a seed company, that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get tedious really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and your friends can only sit around
for so long and you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: give away so many packs of seeds to
everyone that helps you out for breaking
[SPEAKER_02]: their back.
[SPEAKER_02]: My good friends at Mile High Seed Company,
shout out to Mile High Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_02]: they showed me a device.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a bird seed separator.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing is sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pour all your material into the top
and it's got a little hand crank on it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it just spits seeds out one side and all
the other material falls right out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just put that over a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually buy a fully automatic one
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually separates everything for you
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes to separate your trim and
everything from your seeds so you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: it in one pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a nice column and then it'll have a
clear container below it that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks the seeds into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them on eBay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look up Parrot Seed Cleaning Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your price point is going to be about
$159.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fred, buy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's instant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trimming is fun the first seven times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've trimmed 10 times, you want to
put the scissors in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the concept was ... I was
actually a zoologist for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I knew about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what it is is parrots and
birds, whenever you rear birds in an
[SPEAKER_00]: aviary, they waste about 75 to 80% of the
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really picky eaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of go through the food and sit
through what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat one at the time and throw the
rest on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you take all your bird feed
that you buy in the store that's quite
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive for these parrots and stuff like
that and you run it through the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get 70% return back and you just
keep recycling until it's all gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds are dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds are pains in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirty little bastards.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now ... Oh God, excuse me
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to blame that on this hit mat or
the mothership rig that Will brought over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for bringing over the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and shout out to this distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if we can talk about too much
where this distillate came from,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've got a friend out there named
Frosty who I owe a huge shout out to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want to link those two
together, you can, but I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're related.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we've got a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a bunch of material.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put our seeds into the little bird
feeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put all our stuff into the bird feeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pulled the seeds and the material out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke that material or you can
make hash out of that material or you can
[SPEAKER_02]: make edibles out of that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many uses for that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, it is still good quality
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can roll joints out of it and smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to give it to my friend Will and
let him make BHO out of it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high from it, like I said earlier,
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also make oil out of it,
make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make butter out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do anything that you would do with
any other buds out of that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is controversy online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do seeds need to cure?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also all depends on, that's not
where I feel the controversy comes from is
[SPEAKER_00]: from people in the, it's climate,
it's climatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where the controversy comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from the deep swamp in the Florida,
the 100% humidity, 160 degree days every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day of the week is wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air is like soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to cure seeds for like three or
four weeks to get them to germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the air is like soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like that in the south.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to some festivals down south and
it killed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was walking at the, I was at a festival
just walking and I was covered in sweat
[SPEAKER_02]: and I thought I was okay, but I looked
around at my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking, I'm sitting down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone was like, you okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I'm cool, but I'm too
fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sit down right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just needed a minute just to not be
so damn hot for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real muggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of the humidity and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the humidity, the longer you'll
have to cure your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best tricks I've learned since
I moved over here to Colorado takes about
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four days to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I back a four bowl, two foot long T5
fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I back it off about two to three feet
off a pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I let the UVD and all the UV rays and
everything cure the seeds in about three
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear they jump right out of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it hits water, they want to fly
right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our testers came back 100%
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean hundreds and hundreds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a few dry outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for any testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always looking for good testers that's
willing to put in the effort and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: back the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're always looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people hit me up to be a tester.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people hit you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just give these guys an idea of who
is a qualified tester so that we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to keep typing these emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm looking for at least minimum
three to five years experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to pretty much have already run
through every book there is on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can get your hands on the
resource material that's out there because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're given all this free resource
material nowadays, especially with the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no really excuse for you not to
educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it right in front of your face to
educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first number one thing I can
tell any growers, educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to make you a better
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody always, what can I do to make my
plants better?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to learn this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks, but it'll make you better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way that none of us learned
the easy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one held our hand through it or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we're looking for
people that are headstrong, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly internet savvy, that can type a
complete sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't type a complete sentence,
you're automatically disqualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say bae, you're disqualified.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one or two lights that you can
fully dedicate to the seeds that I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to send you.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one light for the 10 pack of
seeds that you're going to get for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want one light of your space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to be able to make a diary of
how your grow went.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of the seeds I sent you
germinated?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of them were females?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many were hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did it take to see sex?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did it take you to find the
hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of those plants were male and
female?
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of those females, how many were
keepers?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many would you run again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you run this strain again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have the ability to get this plant
tested for THC, CBD, THCA, THCV,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have testing capabilities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have turpings testing abilities?
[SPEAKER_02]: How was the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: How was the high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it worth a shit at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did it take to flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: We want that kind of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we want you to get a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's your iPhone, that's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a better camera,
we want you to get a good camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want pictures at least once a week of
each phenotype carefully labeled with the
[SPEAKER_02]: week number, the strain name, and the
phenotype number that you have selected
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can't stand in the industry is the
guy that we give 20 seeds to that pops
[SPEAKER_00]: three seeds and it takes six months to get
a report back on those three seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot stand that more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're that guy, you suck, guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to go ahead and say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been that guy before because our
friend Gage Green Genetics sent me about
[SPEAKER_02]: 7,000 packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tested those yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I only have so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only pull over so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Gage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gage really helped myself out in the
cannabis industry, helping me get where I
[SPEAKER_02]: am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's tell them why it's so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I send you testers, it's because I'm
trying to release a new product line and I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get research done on that so that
I don't put out seeds that are shit
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't want to put them available
at the dankteam.com and then you spend
[SPEAKER_02]: money on them and then they totally suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I send out to my testing team,
I send out quite a large batch of test
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sent out entire first runs of test
batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: This first breeding project, I kept 250 of
them and then sent fucking 1,000 seeds out
[SPEAKER_02]: to other people to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if it's worth the shit, I'll make
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always find, too, the easiest way to
select the best phenotype out of 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds is to have a bunch of really good
testers and stay in contact with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep up with them and have them keep up
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that way, whenever it comes down to
it and you're like, hey, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's something that you don't have for
doing all that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a little trade off or something
for finding it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find keepers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find test results that you don't find
other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know, personally,
a lot of Rusty's and CanAventure's cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that were found.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how our blueberry fuel was found
out of over 500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years later, it came out of Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up out of Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my boy Willie in Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a friend who's doing a really
good job with Capelten and I'm waiting for
[SPEAKER_02]: a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've got a friend who can't be
mentioned who's got a really good cut of
[SPEAKER_02]: the blue healer, which has some little bit
of blue dream in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tried to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to fix the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just added terpenes to it that wasn't
presently there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does really well with OG terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we found because it's already
got some myrosine present and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you normally don't typically
find in sativas, but you can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: taste it in the blue dream, so why not
give it that extra kick and add terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't normally there in different
structures in a shorter flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a tangy blue dream cross at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it's got a really nice structure to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice structure and heavy yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where it lies at anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it has a place on the top
shelf market anymore, but to us breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think it's still golden to these
days because it is so stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's close to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my heart, this is because it's always
been a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit it with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit it with hermaphroditic genes
and it's going to come out great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it and had happy accidents and
great ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't encourage anybody to ... No,
don't do that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't do that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to back up in something we
didn't talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making feminized seeds,
you need to get that male going way early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three weeks ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to get your female plants
ready to flower at week three,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to get those males.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start spraying them in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray them in veg for a week and then
flower them almost six weeks ahead of
[SPEAKER_02]: those girl plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get them a nice fat head
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reversing a plant takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to stifle the copper movement in
the plant by hitting it with the silver
[SPEAKER_02]: thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant needs to react.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to learn what to do with that
reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to change its hormones to create
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it needs to develop these sacs to
create pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it will release pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making your first reversed male,
you're going to be like, I did it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to spray it more and more and
more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even waste time with colloidal
silver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your own silver thiosulfate spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really going to spray the shit
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since all these new growers are coming on
the scene, people are trying to create
[SPEAKER_00]: their new strains of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colloidal silver hype is coming back
stronger than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around about 10 years ago and now
it's back like bell bottoms, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, no, the colloidal silver
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't block the gene well enough and
for long enough and hard enough and strong
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to not create a high ratio
hermaphroditic problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use SDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the long run, it's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to throw it away because I make too
large of a batch at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw tons of it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you buy your first batch,
I've got some from two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you buy a one ounce and a three
ounce jar and I think you use like three
[SPEAKER_02]: grams and two grams out of each jar for
your first mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: My jar is this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can store that jar for like 40,
50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we said earlier, it's in the fridge
right next door to the pollen that we
[SPEAKER_02]: store and it's right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't degrade in there as long as
moisture doesn't get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to make silver thiosulfate
spray, one way to keep it around longer
[SPEAKER_02]: when you mix the two components into these
separate containers of water, keep them
[SPEAKER_02]: separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mix them and they'll store longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also never spray my SDS under light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always take it out, spray it in darkness
until it's just dripping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get the underside of the leaves,
the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stalks are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the stalks and then let it dry out
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even with a little fan beside it and
let it dry out real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you will get burn marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put it back in a room with some
girls that you're not trying to flip,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll have some trannies in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll make some Caitlyn Genero G on
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right because a little bit of rub
here, a little bit of rub there,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little SDS here, a little SDS there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn from doing it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants are going to take a whole
bunch of spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then some are going to burn from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the leaves curl up and look pissed off,
as long as you still have enough of that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to create pollen, you're going to be
all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That male plant is going to look like shit
after that silver thiosulfate spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people really need to
understand too about reversing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had somebody come into my grow and
say, oh, you have a Hermi plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, it's a reverse plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at me and go, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look at me with the most baffled
look on their face and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse plant is totally different than a
hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this on purpose and we're blocking
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually blocking genes in the
genome, whereas the hermaphroditic is like
[SPEAKER_00]: that because of its genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The silver hits the plant and it can't
move by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thiosulfate solution makes it mobile
and absorbable within the plant and that
[SPEAKER_02]: blocks the copper production in the plant,
the copper movement in the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: which triggers an ethylene response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it ethyl or ethylene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, help me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It triggers a response of ethyl or
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say ethyl because ethylene
sounds like more of a, like I'm making
[SPEAKER_02]: meth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like methylamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're thinking ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, either way, it messes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It triggers that hormone and that hormone
is what tells the plant that it wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: change sexes and start producing pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you make pollen that since this plant
has no male chromosomes, it will not
[SPEAKER_02]: donate any male chromosomes to the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll all be female chromosomes with
traits of both plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's taking excessive traits to
its mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mother of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a 50-50 hybrid, that's what
you can expect it to lean toward that
[SPEAKER_00]: mother side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's ideal once you find the keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize not a lot of people were
doing this when I started breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reversing a female to a male and
hitting several females.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was making nine or 10 feminized crosses
at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I realized later that that's not
industry standard of how that's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, people will take a clone
only or their favorite plant and reverse
[SPEAKER_02]: that and hit that pollen on a bunch of the
same clones and just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually been reversing plants and
true breeding with those reversed plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even realize how far out of the
norm I was stepping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most folks would find a keeper and then
keep reversing that one to keep making
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reversed a plant, pollinated another
plant of the clone of the same strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: made seedlings of that, took seeds of
that, took that original plant I reversed
[SPEAKER_02]: and hit the pollen on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a few phenyl generations of
inbreeding, I was unable to reverse the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred it so strong that it's so female it
will not reverse on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a grateful dog experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it GD77 is the one that will not
reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1977 is my favorite year of the grateful
dead is why it got GD77.
[SPEAKER_02]: Random breeder shit right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another rant I want to go on,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might piss people off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It frustrates me when hash makers put two
different strains in a tube and run it
[SPEAKER_02]: together and think that they can now call
it- They call it cross of the average
[SPEAKER_01]: mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, that took you seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes me fucking years to develop
something that I get to name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to name something Who
Express because you put Dr. Who and
[SPEAKER_02]: Pineapple Express in a fucking container
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm half serious, I'm half frustrated,
half don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's misleading to the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's misleading to the medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's hard for them to know what
strains- I know that this is Dr. Who and
[SPEAKER_02]: probably Pineapple Express because I've
been in this long enough, but it's called
[SPEAKER_02]: Who Express.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a medical patient and you're not
hip and paying attention on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know what the fuck that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Dr. Who is your favorite,
but maybe Pineapple Express gives you
[SPEAKER_02]: panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be OG and Tangy for all you
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can name it whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a handful of Who and the rest
Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really 50-50 bland or is it what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even label it so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be a hater on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that that's a little bit
misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come to the point in technology and
this cannabis industry where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be stepping up here in
Colorado and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the guys that are- these guys
sitting at this table right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: among other growers here in Colorado,
are the ones that are sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront for all the other states because
they're all looking at this state going,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're falling in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking the lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking the lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started ever since I've been in
Colorado and we're proud to be a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular company will only accept
1,000 gram runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand the need to mix shit because
if you've got a pound of this and a pound
[SPEAKER_02]: of this, then you got a 1,000 gram run.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of trim, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say their name or
anything because I just talk shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they do make a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just find it frustrating and misleading
almost to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just giving them constructive
criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't label it, they should label
it as so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes them that much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: No disrespect to the people that are
forced to combine batches because metric
[SPEAKER_02]: makes you do certain shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it, but I just wish it didn't have
to be that way because as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to take Grateful Dog and Girl Scout
cookies and put it together and call it
[SPEAKER_02]: doggy style.
[SPEAKER_02]: If two people do that to hash,
I don't feel like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just grab two tubes and mix my trim
together and now they just made a new
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can't use the name that they just
took because now everyone- Exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why this one right here,
you see, I just call it the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: did it blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how you labeled that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could say their names out loud
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they were still sitting at this
table right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten to the point where we're
pulling seeds out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're curing buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep tabs on where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have any notebook paper and I
can still do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to cure them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say that here in Colorado,
we only got to cure them for three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that in the South that
you had soup for air.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot more sense to me to
people that have argued that they need
[SPEAKER_02]: some cure time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My theory was that the seeds finish in the
buds, in nature, the seeds would finish in
[SPEAKER_02]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds would dry up and die and they
would fall into the ground and they would
[SPEAKER_02]: sit in the ground all winter and that
would be their natural cure time,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is part of why I cure them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep my seeds in a cooler because I
think that nature would keep them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: snow maybe, depending on where they are,
maybe cold rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's what's also going to germinate
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rains are going to come and germinate
them in the spring and then they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to start popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just figured that they would be curing
in the plant in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been domesticated to the point now
where there's only certain regions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of places in the world
that weed actually grows just completely
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, like actual weed, not hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actual cannabis that it grows naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: West Himalayan mountains, places like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to go up there where I've seen
Aryan and his crew go up and smoke some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa is full of a lot of old Malawi and
places like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just full of old land race
genetics that are falling and dying and
[SPEAKER_00]: the same crops coming over and over and
over again every year in the same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are heirloom genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to keep talking about seeds,
but I've got another random note that I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to interrupt because I've got some
great people here that are great to have
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys seen Aryan from Greenhouse
Seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Aryan and Franco and Simon travel all
around the world and they go to these
[SPEAKER_02]: places where they're growing land race
genetics and they check it out and they
[SPEAKER_02]: ask the farmers for seeds and the farmers
happily will give them a bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aryan then in return hands them packs of
his colored greenhouse seeds because his
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds are rolled in colored coating
because then he can tell what strain they
[SPEAKER_02]: are without having them in packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're rolled in some candy coating that
is also worked as a fertilizer and helps
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He trades them these oftentimes feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys feel that he is fucking up the
land race genetics in these places by
[SPEAKER_02]: adulterating them with his seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if they're planting them right out
there with their land races and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-pollinating and they just keep dying
and regrowing and then eventually I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be a different ... It does
fuck up the heirloom line, but at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time I've seen a lot of those heirloom
genetics and stuff like that and nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: to really brag home about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look great on paper, but they look
like some straight swag when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: finished drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really nothing to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hindsight's 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to bring a better yielding
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of at what cost kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, you're going to give them
better genetics for their future and their
[SPEAKER_00]: kids and their kids and their kids are
going to have better yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: better plants and stuff like that,
which is going to yield more profits for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be able to yield more
food for their families and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, like you said,
you're going to come in and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to completely disasterize those heirlooms,
which that's thousands of generations of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have been doing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's history, but change is inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm torn on the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really kind of look 50-50 at
everything because life is a carburetor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have good and bad to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Will said, someone's going to get in
there at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something at some point would as I'm sure
over the thousands of years that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: been another type of cross that got in
there on accident somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been somebody's Mexican weed
from Florida or it could be greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess greenhouse seeds isn't so bad
when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give him that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the seeds are cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a big ass bag or maybe a smaller
portion of dried and cured seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we store them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can use dried rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is steal silicon packets
out of electronics and things and things I
[SPEAKER_00]: get in the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you keep all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little silicon packs that you get
like when you buy a new computer or your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collect all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I save them up here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just grab them, throw them in the
freezer as soon as or freezer refrigerator
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as possible to keep moisture away
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way they prolong the life of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of tell when they're good and
when they're bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're nice and good and clear
color, they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they turn like a dark or an amber
color or a dark brown color, they're no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've actually pulled moisture and
bacteria and things out of the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gave them that color, the oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're no longer good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one good way to find out when you
crack it open, take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always crack them open, put them all in
a big jar and actually give them in my
[SPEAKER_00]: seed packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, in our vials, we do a layer of
beads that we do a layer and then we do a
[SPEAKER_00]: layer of cotton, then the seeds and the
cotton and the beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's like a 30 year storage vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can throw that in your
refrigerator for 30 years and pull it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: pop those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to up my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple, but effective because we got the,
you know, we got the mylar packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in itself is a food saving package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the vial inside and then
we use those beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time girls would get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get them, that's because we
didn't have any to get right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, you still get the cotton
and the vial and everything else like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically we always put beads in there
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have asked me, what's that for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Testers have asked me, what are these
beads for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are the seeds in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one guy ask me, are the seeds in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I couldn't see them in the cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't see them in the cotton and
there was just these little silicon beads
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it also kind of throws them
off if you're looking for them in the mail
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a free refrigerator store,
not freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say you don't want to,
you don't want a freezer because once you
[SPEAKER_00]: get below freezing point, you're basically
the water inside of the embryo is trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have more cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically, you're basically
creating a large earthquake inside of your
[SPEAKER_00]: embryo because it's trying to expand and
crack outwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has nowhere else to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's isolated and it shows all
the water in there is going to crack and
[SPEAKER_00]: expand that, that, that embryo and destroy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to stay anything above
freezing temperature, 32 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now here's my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've got a whole bunch of seeds,
you've got your herbs separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do something with that herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move on to talk about
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite part, grow a bunch of the
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get as many as you can and figure out how
much space you've got and then grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant more seeds than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to have, even if
you're not a large scale breeder and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have 500 seeds, you know, give them to
your friends and do your own testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the guys like me, give them the
guys like, well, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never take some, we'll grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you might have some amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go 10 of them for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some in from California called
silver widow and, uh, it's a super silver
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, white widow cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take 112 days to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pictures look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, there's some good
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find them, but, uh,
yeah, it's a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a, it's a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just, and if there's nothing
there, then we throw them in the trash can
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just how it works afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we smoke it and blast it, whatever we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it goes, go onto,
onto the next project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to have a passion for
doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a lot of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing we're looking for
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's passion,
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many, uh, people dedicated to
what they do just because they do it
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: What percentage of your breeding project
gets totally scrapped?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you breed, you make seeds, you take a
few of those seeds, you grow out so many
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go, uh, how many times have
you just completely flushed a bag of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: down the toilet because the project wasn't
worth a shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say at least 30, 40% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good breeder right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just actually went through my box like
two weeks ago, man, and just threw away
[SPEAKER_00]: like handfuls and handfuls of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff from Michigan, a lot of
stuff I did back in Florida, a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the old stuff I had just,
just tossing it as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important that you don't get your ego
stuck on a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might really think that this cross
you've got and this male you've got is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make the next fucking hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't, don't be afraid to
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and toss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want those shitty seeds out on
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can breed again, you can make
something way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're not going to be known as
that guy that made that hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_02]: weak shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be that guy that made that next
flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to know, we want to know if
you got problems with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know if you do a great garden
and you're automatically having
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic problems and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know these things, you know,
that's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some breeders are too big to give a
shit, but you know, we're not those guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for a fact that we're always
down to answer questions and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: we're here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for coming for a few,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you think we should cover?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got all the way down to growing them,
giving them out to your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got some start to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take careful notes, find the keepers,
give them to your friends to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: then make F2s because F2 is where shit
gets really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get a recessive segregation,
transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where your offspring will show
better traits than its parents will
[SPEAKER_02]: outperform each parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you'll see some cool shit
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't believe, don't believe in too much
hype that you hear on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either try it for yourself and make your
own determination.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to get in there and grow
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had, I've had F6 lavenders from
someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of them was hermy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so, so, you know, you really,
would you attribute that to the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: he makes his pollen sometimes?
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he, he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also does a lot of
rottalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for a fact that he's written
articles on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read from him that he's done a lot of
rottalization, which is basically taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant past its harvest point to the point
where it's creating a female banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: then harvesting a female banana,
which basically is hermaphroditic banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also will light a fire and almost
put the plant on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes into a panic mode and that
panic mode makes it do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it spit out herm flowers,
which have herm pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also do it light stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he does a lot of old school funky shit
that, and shout out to someone,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's done a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of his strains are some of the
greatest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still to this day, like lavender,
I mentioned, that's, that's a legendary
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get good phenotypes out of
them, they taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so Gouda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, they, they, some of the best
concentrates that lavender is on point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but there's a lot of these old
school strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone was one of the guys,
if it wasn't for him, the, the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: city diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really wouldn't be as hot today as it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked his, oh man, the G 13
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a G 13 Hayes that I picked up a
while back from Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved the flavor of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff is still hit and miss,
but when you find the good keepers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're keepers, but you got a lot of run,
a lot of his gear to find those keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of like DJ shorts the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the DJ, but hey,
you know, quit breeding girl weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But DJ breeds specifically for what he
wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't give a shit about the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a sativa lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a sativa lover and that's what he
breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's his thing, you know,
but he has to understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, he, he, he does pay for a lot of
his advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets great advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, that dude has got some
bad ass advertising guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like his book.
[SPEAKER_00]: His book is definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great grower and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not my forte.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's the same thing with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to run a hundred seeds to get a
good, you know, type, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like, I can generally say,
I know you gauge me, can't adventure quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a few others in this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had 10 packs and found three keepers
out of heat, rare dankness, very dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those keepers, you know, I've gotten some
really wonky plants from our dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say in the same 10 pack
that would make it up, make up for all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit they've ever sold me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh yeah, there's one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it was with us with rug burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran up through a bunch of rug burn
seeds and every one of them was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got an eighth of a piece off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the lankiest wonky is
looking, it's smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't, I don't think gauge
gets enough credit in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like more people need to notice gauge
green genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a definitely a high end breeding
company that gets overlooked in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they got good material they're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the material they have is golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph OG is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Joseph ocean beach cross was one of
the, one of the highly sought after,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, very quick and gone plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was, that was coming gone
so fast because it went out basically as
[SPEAKER_00]: testers and never came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may still have a pack of testers from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, honestly, I have a small manila
envelope filled with gauge green genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: tester.
[SPEAKER_02]: Packs because you just used to send me so
much and you'd be like, run what you can.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the, uh, the dominant oceans out
of that one, out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I actually bred with them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a new one coming out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pre 98 bubba also they'll be ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to sort of Joseph, Joseph is just
too stringy and I hate the way he does
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to hit him with that proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit that pre 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught Bay behind, but, uh, my prize
mail is in a rise mail, which was started
[SPEAKER_00]: with a daybreaker mail from gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sad to admit that I've done dabs
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those are good kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we talked about it and you
go to them with a 10 pack and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I got the Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you mind if I breathe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look at you and key
player Mike until you go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll help you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have respect for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of use anything that I breed to the
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to use, I don't copy gauge,
but I use their scheme in the names like
[SPEAKER_02]: arise and cascade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all crosses that came from the
gauge mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try to honor them in the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get a little bit of props to
where it came from respect to the elders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the Bay pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a Bay pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: California pine trees, you know,
and it's where it's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get a little homage back to
Callie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to give love to everybody that does
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, we've been going for
like an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to start wrapping up this part of
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you were a little bit quiet,
but we talked a lot about seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was here to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys took me to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you learned a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grew some Kalanji Kush from my seeds
and that shit looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually still have a mother from,
uh, that, that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I just, I'm actually about to
take a bunch of cuts this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely take one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's better than the cut that I've
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you saying that a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the cut agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your cut looks better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like covered in covered in trikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It often favors to grow too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It often gets confused for La Plata labs
is Durango OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell on the Kalanji was, uh,
it was something I had never I had never
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled weed like that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone I showed it to was like,
what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crazy.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really all I got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, uh, got pictures of the new grow

[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about that the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, obviously what made me think about it
was a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear straight up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's a good name for thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I go into can of sewer a lot and
they run your rise in there.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the favorites of the bud
tenders in my shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shout out to the can of sewer,
I guess I'm going to have to stop in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and buy an eighth just to see what it's
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason why I ever go into that
place is because they're like the only
[SPEAKER_00]: place in Pueblo West that doesn't just
rape you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can go in and get 125 ounces
if I'm out between harvest, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's, it's the weeds crap,
but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to let you have that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say the weeds crap,
quit, quit using machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim machines suck, hire people,
employ humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, support your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop cutting it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit doing machine work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's a lot of the,
what the problem is once they do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they got a fantastic looking grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They overfeed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're playing,
it's like the time to shoes, time to back
[SPEAKER_00]: off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of, speaking of trimming weed,
I owe a shout out to my buddy,
[SPEAKER_02]: John Randall's junior.

no complaints.

doesn't it?

[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing is the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a good host that doesn't have a lot
of spam and security and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: it costs you a fortune.

into my forum every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say those Ray-Bans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, uh, they join the forum and then
they just go and they type in in the
[SPEAKER_02]: forum, they figure out how to put in
script in their forum posts that can
[SPEAKER_02]: corrupt my website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they started stealing shit out of
my website and then redirecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, this happened twice now,
but I'm going to walk down pretty well
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I feel like I just taunted people,
but please don't fuck up my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we had a great moderator, but it was a
lot on him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, that was like taking a
path of his day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just trying to get rid of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the moderator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the email that says a hacker has
registered to your forum and I have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: delete their account, block them,
delete all their posts.
