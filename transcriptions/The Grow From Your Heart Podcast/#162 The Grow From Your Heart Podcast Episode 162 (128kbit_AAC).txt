[SPEAKER_04]: Mystic Roots Band for letting me use their
music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Kat, Kud, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday evening
in Pueblo, Colorado, and it is hot as shit
[SPEAKER_04]: for some reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it so warm, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You blame?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost 710.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Across the table from me is a repeat
offender.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you caught that in the
intro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did say barefoot grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy, Will, is a barefoot grower,
is back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: My lips are all sticky because we just
took some super delicious dabs,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the dab rig that I've got from Elevate
has that mouthpiece that makes your mouth
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of do the kissy face, and it made my
lips all sticky, so my words are going...
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny over here for seeing me
trying to struggle and talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this sticky dab wax in my mustache.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab residue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day, I'm ranting now,
but back in the day, I used to go to the
[SPEAKER_04]: clinic in Denver, and they sold this
Durban Poison wax, and it had the best
[SPEAKER_04]: high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after you would smoke it, if you put
your teeth together, they would stick
[SPEAKER_04]: together a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just sit there and just stick my
teeth together and pull them apart and
[SPEAKER_04]: tink, tink, tink, tink, and just do it
over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what that feeling is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was almost like you took a bite of a
crayon, kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for some reason, I loved the texture
the way I... I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will quit ranting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I got to give anybody a shout out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass
because I've been hitting this purple or
[SPEAKER_04]: this orange pumpkin rig like a boss,
that banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: This banger is filthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rig needs a bath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, you guys, for the dope rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still blowing glass, dude,
or has that kind of been... No,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just kind of put on... I'm hoping
to maybe one day get back into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you miss it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do miss it every now and then,
especially... You can see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a huge smile when we started
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whenever I go, because I have some
friends that still do it, and if I go to
[SPEAKER_03]: their house or whatever and I get into the
studio, it kind of like... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fingers started spinning?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always just like, man, I want to kind
of ask them if I can hop behind a torch,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're not blowing glass,
so I don't want to intrude and... That gas
[SPEAKER_04]: is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And glass is expensive too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think you still got the spin
technique mastered?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to think I do, but I don't know if
it's like riding a bike or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to kind of figure it out because
I would take a couple of days off and I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: notice a difference back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got these big fumbly wookie hands and
I can't... So when you're blowing glass,
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys, I know very, very little about
making glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're blowing glass,
you got to turn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to turn your right hand and your
left hand at the same time, and you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: have the torch in the middle-ish or
whatever section you're heating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if one hand spins faster than the
other, your shit starts twisting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if one hand goes higher than the
other, your piece starts bending,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's a flame in front of you and
it's hot and your muscles start twitching
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the people who do the
twist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So man, your work was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you get back into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I'll be able to do it one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about your new venture now.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that I wrote down that I
wanted to make sure we cover is that you
[SPEAKER_04]: went from a basement grow to a large
facility in a very short time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how long... You're from North Carolina,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you grow ganja in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like had did it for a few years
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not successfully for the first year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tried in Asheville and just failed
miserably.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got into flower and then like sprayed
Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the plants as a foliar one day and like
totally like just... I really don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those just had nobody to
ask, nothing to do and thought that was
[SPEAKER_03]: how...
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So killed those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I lived in Charlotte,
I had an apartment and I got a tent and
[SPEAKER_03]: started growing in my closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got some genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was some irie genetics back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this couldn't have been too long ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was about...
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been here for about a year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would have been about two and a half
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was going to be one of my next
questions is how long you've been here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you grew in Charlotte then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Successfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a couple of harvests there in my
closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which strain did you pull off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart of Gold.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an easy one to grow too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Golden Goat and Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a super good cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a place in my heart for Golden
Goat because of that strain specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have a Golden Goat clone in the
future for you if you remind me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take clones of her in just a
few nights here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, remind me of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you pulled off a couple of harvests
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, how sketchy is that growing in North
Carolina?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sketchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I was doing it, I mean,
I had a little CFL hood thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a really low key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't put off a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had four little plants in a little tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a two by four tent,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty small.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I was doing like a basement grow or
something, yeah, that'd be real sketchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People talk there too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've met so many, everybody that I've met
from North Carolina, like Spence,
[SPEAKER_04]: Matty, Slop is kind of from North
Carolina, Fong, all you folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Tater from North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See all you folks that I met from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I missed a few people guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are all awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all super great dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every one of you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, super red people from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew other people, other outside of
your crew that are just super awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like your guys' whole town moved here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a ghost town now with no cool
people there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the shitty people just stayed.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the cool people came right over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've been here for about a year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since May of 2015, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long did it take you to get a grow set
up when you got here?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the first thing I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got here and like day one went out into
the shed in the backyard, started gutting
[SPEAKER_03]: it out, took down all the shelves,
put up mops.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the shit still in the U-Haul truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even bring a U-Haul.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just packed my car up and drove out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love people that do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad it worked out for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people came out and weren't able
to put it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad you're motivated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Motivated potheads.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how long did it take?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you blew glass for like about six or
eight months, it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about six, seven months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was paying attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you got into how did tell us
where you're working now with the large
[SPEAKER_04]: facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am now at a sin cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to use that for a screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Name became a rise when we're talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's a sin cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our dispensary up in Lakewood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our grow greenhouse is here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge facility is pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a big step up from the
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many plants are you in charge of?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 320 plants and flower at all times
that I'm in charge of.
[SPEAKER_03]: What size pots?
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are huge plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those aren't just little baby plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty big plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the summer, it's not uncommon to see
like every plant hit a half pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How often in the summer at peak harvest or
at peak flowering?
[SPEAKER_04]: How often do those plants need to be
watered?
[SPEAKER_03]: We water every other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the plants like in the center of
the greenhouse where they get more sun and
[SPEAKER_03]: more light every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we had a lot of we had a couple of
beds that we were hitting every single
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how many gallons of water
you're throwing in a 20 gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's around two and a half gallons per I
believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly expected more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm doing my math wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have it's 300 gallons for 120
plants every other day because our bed has
[SPEAKER_03]: 160 plants in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two in a fraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to try to do that while I'm
talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading notes and trying to look at
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do that much math.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that like a good solid eight to 10
hours of work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were there every single day from seven
o'clock until on a good day we got at
[SPEAKER_03]: four, four thirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus like a little bit of a drive because
it's not right in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's out in the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they put everything out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's beautiful spots out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went for a drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a friend of mine to go see the
leaves change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to JB.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took her to go see the leaves change
colors out by toward the castle and we
[SPEAKER_04]: went to the castle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, we went before the fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still raging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big shout out to all the people that
have to deal with those fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel so bad for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My whole vibe just changed when I thought
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we went out there and there are so if
you're paying attention, there are so many
[SPEAKER_04]: grows out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a grow every five miles off to the
left or the right side of the interstate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are super high tech and
fancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are a little jank.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are so many grows out there from
from Pueblo to all the way into almost to
[SPEAKER_04]: the castle.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a grow on Highway 96 to the left
or the right all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, if you got to take your
girlfriends out there or your significant
[SPEAKER_04]: other or your side chick or your boo,
you got to take them out on a road trip to
[SPEAKER_04]: go look at the leaves in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go drive up Highway 96 between Pueblo and
like Wetmore and then keep going even
[SPEAKER_04]: further up into Westcliff and look at all
of the grows on the left and right side of
[SPEAKER_04]: the inter on the highway while your girls
looking at all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You started off in a basement grow like
most growers do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start off in a tent like a lot of
growers do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Graduated to a basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen your pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You crush it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grew some Kalanji Kush that was
gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud of that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorites too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two of my favorite strains put
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Tahoe, Gee and Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't really go wrong right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Swerve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got both those from Swerve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell was I going with this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some of the stuff that
you learned that is different,
[SPEAKER_04]: that you had to adjust major differences
you've noticed and learned going from like
[SPEAKER_04]: a small grow in your basement to this big
gigantic facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you had a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many square feet that
greenhouse is?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've asked a couple people.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one seems to know for sure what it is,
but we have two flower rooms and in each
[SPEAKER_03]: flower room there is 640 plants and 20
gallons and or raised bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got raised beds and a couple raised
beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you prefer the raised beds or the
raised bed all day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Spencer seems to be loving those too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Garden of Weed now in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's better about them?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just with the way we do them,
our raised beds are fed differently than
[SPEAKER_03]: we do our 20s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our 20s we actually get the Mbesa compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use those and we brew those,
but for the raised bed it's been no-till
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's been going no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't added any soil to it other than
what goes in with the transplants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been like that since the opening of
the greenhouse I think two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full of life because we're all
organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full of life, full of microbes and
it's just really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants seem to get a little bit bigger
in the raised bed too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got more space for the roots to
get out and the flowers just always seem
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a little bit better out of the
raised bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to transition into complete
all raised beds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeping that life going in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about that when we get to
the next part here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk more about some of the stuff
that you had to change and that you've
[SPEAKER_04]: noticed going to the Big Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest I've ever had in my house is a
4K in a basement and now we've got 112
[SPEAKER_03]: Gavitas in each room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got 224 lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going from four lights to 224 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just getting used to the size of the
plants and how often I got to water them
[SPEAKER_03]: and how much I got to water them really
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It put into perspective how little I
actually was doing at my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made my growing at home a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a hobby grow now.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, wow, I used to think that
watering these 20 plants was hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, I got to water my 20
plants now, but now I'm watering 320 every
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing maintenance on them, defoliating,
checking for bugs, making sure there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: problems, putting supporting sticks
everywhere you need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an MED grow, so you got to make sure
that everything is tagged properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one thing that was really crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had never done anything other than a
basement grow until I got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never worked in any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been in the industry ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my badge and started working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one thing that was crazy was
seeing how heavily everything has to be
[SPEAKER_03]: tagged, tracked.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get rid of it, you have to make
sure that you get rid of it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: computer and throw it in the right basket
and incinerate the basket.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's overkill, but I like the overkill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it keeps everybody in check
and it keeps the people that shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps them at bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates a standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't live up to that standard,
then you shouldn't be growing this
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a medical product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also a recreational product for a lot
of people, but I think that recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: use is also medical, if that makes sense.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my freedom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's my vice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting too old to go to too many
concerts and go do ridiculous shit and
[SPEAKER_04]: just take some dabs and play on my phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cool with that for a minute sometimes
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my recreational outlet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, 320 giant plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you defoliate that all yourself,
pest management all yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's six of us that work there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's six growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 1,280 plants in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's about 700 in veg, 400 under the
T5s, and another 600 clones.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six of us manage that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our spray days on Wednesday and
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I sent you that sprayer we had
that one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crazy one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody rotates how we spray,
but we spray two days a week all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: through up until the last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are, like I said, all organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're spraying 100% organic neem oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% organic essentials.
[SPEAKER_03]: No chemicals or nothing on there.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all food.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's kind of transition to that part
because that's something that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely noticed since you started
working at this place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your home grow has completely switched to
fully organic now, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that inspired by this place?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was inspired by a few different things,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started working there and when I got in
the grow, I was watering my plants and so
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed something to listen to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started listening to old podcast
episodes of yours that I hadn't listened
[SPEAKER_03]: to since I lived in North Carolina because
I figured I've learned a couple of new
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can take anything new from
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was listening to the episodes of when
Sean came on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean, shout out to Kingcola.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was so passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of cool to me and I was
like, it seems pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm learning about what I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I also started hanging out with
Frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frosty Organics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frosty Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's super passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was throwing drop of knowledge on me
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one day I just was like, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my outdoor going and I was like,
I'm going to do a raised bed, no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic outdoor for the summer and see how
much I like organic and I might switch to
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I was like, why don't I just
completely go organic?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's so much, I know it's
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made the switch completely and now that
I've been doing it, I've had one full
[SPEAKER_03]: complete from, because I switched kind of
halfway through a cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to use these bottles
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm organic now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had plants and veg and then plants
halfway through flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went through that cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants and veg came through and I went
through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just now, just like last week took out
my first from seed to harvest,
[SPEAKER_03]: like 100% fully organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by far the best grow I've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best personal I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to continue that path for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to eventually turn your home
grow into no-till?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing no-till soil right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reusing the soil that I have in my
pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using seven gallon pots and just
taking the root ball out and putting the
[SPEAKER_03]: two gallons in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to teach my listeners just
briefly a quick lesson on no-till?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't think we've covered too
much no-till on the podcast.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say as much as I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm by no means an expert on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm new to this thing as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically no-till soil is when you
have a soil that you've amended yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: and you've planted the plant in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just feed it top dressings and
whatever teas you want to do, whatever you
[SPEAKER_03]: got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got worms in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a lot of microbe life going in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's after three years, I believe,
that you've been running the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never actually take the soil up or put
new soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You reuse the soil every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just taking the root ball out and putting
a new plant in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using the old dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: No-till, you want to irritate the land as
little as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: After three years, it's basically
self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you need to do is add water.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the no-till, you've got a lot of
microbe life living in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a lot of microorganisms
breaking everything down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants are really, really,
really going to thrive in a
[SPEAKER_03]: well-maintained no-till environment
because you're not really feeding your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're feeding these microorganisms that
live in your soil, and then they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to absorb all these things that you're
feeding them, release them back into the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, and that's what your plants are
going to uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cycle of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how things are meant to be,
and you're just carefully maintaining it
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows the plant to eat what it wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly the ratios it wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not force-feeding it some bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not holding it down, putting a
nipple on a bottle, trying to show some
[SPEAKER_04]: formula in its mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I grow a crop now that's not no-till,
because it's not amended, so I can't do
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask if I could take a plant
that I'm going to harvest tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_04]: chop the plant, pull the root ball out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I now start my no-till process with
that soil, or do I need to pre-prep my pot
[SPEAKER_03]: at the beginning?
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably could, but it would probably
be best to start it in an amended soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, you've already got your soil is
already inoculated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got life all the way from the top
to the bottom, because if you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing a new plant in there at that
point, it's going to take a couple weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: for it to take off, really, because
there's no life in there to give it food.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to fire up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to get going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to create that life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be searching for the food,
and it's not going to take off for
[SPEAKER_03]: probably a week or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a great method.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could do it, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a great method.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Lindsay, the Traveling
Stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: She just called while returning to a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll call you back after we get done.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was not live, but she definitely
listens to every episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll hear this part.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what she wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what she wants to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: She got a new carb cap in that I'm excited
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's called a clit cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the shape of a vagina.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a carb cap, and it looks like a
vagina on the rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: She wants to take dabs and use that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we on my notes?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got distracted here.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like something that's
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds cheesy, but you feel more in
sync with your plants when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: controlling their environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Sean was here often and we all got
in, when I was being sponsored by the
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company, big shout out
to Jay from the Rocky Mountain Worm
[SPEAKER_04]: Company, they were sponsoring me and they
were actually giving me all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: amendments that I needed to do everything
organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really loved my product and I felt like
a farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had worm shit underneath my fingernails
and I smelled like fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a Neiman kelp tea brewing in my
house right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to walk in the door and it's
going to just smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to smell that kelp meal as soon
as I walk in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love walking in and you've got the five
gallon bucket of tea brewing and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: foam three feet high off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming off the edge a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ran at Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did nutrients that came out of big five
gallon jugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put them into basically a beaker and
then put those into a reservoir and mixed
[SPEAKER_04]: it and adjusted the pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it with goggles on and gloves and it
felt very scientific.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked that as well for some fun reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now at home I'm running on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like botanic hair bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's simple for what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I breed and so I don't need to do a lot of
crazy shit for what I'm breeding with and
[SPEAKER_04]: the botanic hair is perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like mixing the bottles a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put some worm castings in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's organic amendments in the soil,
but when it comes time to feed a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit, I grab the bottles of botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be the easiest way for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I shift up so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a bunch of veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got veg bloom that'll probably go in
the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually noticed I wanted to save
this for a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed that we'll do an episode
about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certain strains actually prefer certain
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed that if I, because I've ran,
I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've ran so many nutrient lines and I've
had flow for 10 years and I've noticed
[SPEAKER_04]: that if I run flow with this brand,
it acts this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I run flow with this brand,
it acts this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different brands, because I've had the
same grow room set up for so long and the
[SPEAKER_04]: blood change from different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Syco made everything real colorful and
fluffy, but I hated the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Advanced Nutrients made everything taste
exactly the same, but I got huge buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: but everything tasted exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Advanced might've been one of the
first brands I tried to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started with Mills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen good work with Mills.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked, I mean, when I was, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the results that I was getting,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The organic is just, it's, I don't know,
like I said, it's more fun to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm doing more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I've grabbed this, I've got a pencil
dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually, it looks like a,
it looks like a green colored pencil and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's actually a glass dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just grabbed this to try to make a note.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to reach this way and not
look like a dumb ass and grab a pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll make a note.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a no-till episode in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get Frosty on here for that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Frosty live in Pueblo or Springs?
[SPEAKER_04]: He lives in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he was a Springs kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty, why haven't you been on the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Frosty, if you listen to this,
just text me or message me on Instagram or
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook right now and be like,
how do I get on your podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, I'll get Will to put me in
touch with you or I'll hit you up on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram and we'll get you on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about no-till because I'm sure a lot
of our listeners are like, I want to know
[SPEAKER_04]: the recipe for the soil, but we're going
to tease them and we're going to make a
[SPEAKER_04]: no-till episode for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys just got teased.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on two cool episodes that are going
to be coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are worms in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: How large is your raised bed?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing three by three or four by
four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is about three feet tall, but then it
goes like, Oh, it's long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 40 plants in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes, there's a really, really,
really, really long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to ask how many worms are
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how many did you put in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they've been in there for,
we haven't added any new worms in forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've just been in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worms multiply pretty quickly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come down and check it out if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds great to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to come check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gone to enough big outdoor grows
this year for some reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to bring you guys some genetics
or how we can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the more of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were going to say earlier that you
got to label everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's got to be tagged by the MED.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't just grab a clone and drive
over there and be like, here's a clone you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have Capelton.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd bring you some 31% test and genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be fun over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the next evolution if you go all
full no-till, then what's the next way to
[SPEAKER_03]: improve your garden after that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, once you're a no-till,
you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You figure out some good top dress recipes
really just because I mean, by that point,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you've got a full on no-till like,
I mean, Mountain Organics and everybody on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram really wants to see like some
really, I mean, this guy is where I
[SPEAKER_03]: discovered no-till from a couple of years
back before I even knew what no-till was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was following this guy, Mountain
Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the tech down with the no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, once you've got it going for
like that many cycles, you know what you
[SPEAKER_03]: need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really don't think there's much more
you can do other than just kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing if anything new comes out,
you know, if a new style or something
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out, just taking care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics, more phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said that you use easy cloners at the
Big Grow when we were talking before the
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do those organically?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OMRI, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Hormex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Hormex is an RO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we do some, we just started using
this inoculant from Mountain Organics
[SPEAKER_03]: actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is supposed to be the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually just started using that last
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told that inside of the clone X
dipping gel that I use for my cloner that
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a excuse me for the throat
clearing, that there is a chemical called
[SPEAKER_04]: purple lavender dye, I think is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lavender, I think it's purple lavender
dye.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a friend of mine was like,
oh dude, don't use that shit because he
[SPEAKER_04]: saw it on my shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's actually, I don't know his
degree, but he's got college degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he saw it, he was like,
no, he kind of freaked out on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently clone X is a no-go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to use that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me to get rid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys do some research, that purple
velvet dye or purple crystalline velvet
[SPEAKER_04]: dye or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recall exactly, but if you Google
clone X, find the ingredients,
[SPEAKER_04]: that purple dye in there is supposed to be
really bad for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's something in there that it's
really not good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get it on your hands and stuff,
it could definitely cause you some
[SPEAKER_04]: problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go do some research on clone X.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was asking Will how they do
it organically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we do most of our, we only use the
clone boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are like, we're trying to phase out
of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just have two of those right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our clones go into little root
rights that we have packed into little
[SPEAKER_03]: like one by one cubes with some pro mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just a little like a solution of
RO, aloe, and then some humic acids from
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we dip those in the aloe and just
let those sit in the domes for two weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem to love aloe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's on the aloe kick now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you just using like liquid aloe or
powder?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we get just straight raw cold pressed
aloe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just dip the cutting in that, put it right
into the root riot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the, if you're putting it in your
water, I mean, you need just a small
[SPEAKER_03]: finite amount of aloe goes a long,
long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for a whole 300 gallons when we're
watering our plants, we use one ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just one ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a coffee cup, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a shot glass shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shot glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it say one ounce or 30 ounces?
[SPEAKER_04]: You said one ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just over judged it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking, yeah, I went way bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are going to be thinking,
where can I get some powdered aloe?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something, uh, if you've got a
recommendation, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you said it before I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not pay the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the place to go for that type of
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get powdered coconut water,
uh, powdered aloe, uh, just go check out
[SPEAKER_04]: build a soil.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend that everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like, don't know anything about
organics and like don't know where to go
[SPEAKER_03]: and need it's, but he's got everything you
need on there to start doing organically
[SPEAKER_03]: from like buying the supplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he also has like, uh,
directions on how to clone veg,
[SPEAKER_03]: flour, different top dress regimens.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got everything you need to know on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a real, real, real cool guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't checked out their website in a
little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but yeah, I need to go check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they've updated.
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole bunch since I've done business
with them, but yeah, they've got all your
[SPEAKER_04]: powdered dry organic amendments and
they'll ship them to you everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're here in Colorado, Fort Collins,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The great prices, very affordable.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more you buy, the cheaper it gets
because they're powdered in their bulk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they don't waste a lot of money on a
lot of packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're actually going to make a little
package up for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to weigh it there in their
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to ship out exactly what you
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got great customer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one time there was a weird,
something weird in my order.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered like two things on the same day
and wanted it to be in the same order.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I emailed him and like, he personally
called me from like his cell phone and he
[SPEAKER_03]: got it worked out with me and got it all
shipped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No extra charge, nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love, I love companies that do that kind
of stuff in the grow industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of companies that if they
make a mistake, they go home.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got your money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll either see you again or we won't
because we get plenty of business from
[SPEAKER_04]: plenty of other people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote down a whole bunch of notes,
but you wrote down a bunch of notes too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that we cover anything
that you wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty is a good dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see that dude often enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to make sure to give that dude a
huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get them on the show for no
till frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be nervous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just come on the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, I guess the one thing I missed
here, uh, is the vortex brewers and
[SPEAKER_03]: irrigation systems that I learned at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into, uh, brewing teas,
uh, combo season, everything, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the more agitation they get,
the better is how they, they brew faster
[SPEAKER_03]: and a little, it's going to be a little
stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: The microbes are going to be a little more
active.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, if they brew, uh, more irrigated,
so just using air stones works,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, uh, the vortex brewer, uh,
it's kind of self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like, you know, it's a vortex that
spins inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's three tubes and it spins the water
really fat, like a vortex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll get, uh, I mean, you'll get a
tea brewing where you'll have bubbles
[SPEAKER_03]: popping up within minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like there's no extra Yuka in
there or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's just, it gets activated so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually seen guys clean out their
vortex brewer and put bubble bags in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And make hash in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's been so rapidly that they just
totally make hash with it in the off
[SPEAKER_04]: season.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you harvest and clean it out,
make some hash, then clean it out again
[SPEAKER_04]: and then put tea in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the irrigation system, what else were
you going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_03]: The irrigation systems are cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, I could never be able to run one
at my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I mean, I'm, like I said,
I run a 4k.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have like at most 40 plants inside,
but, uh, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's, you know, I'm sure most people
know about them with their growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: but for those of you that don't,
it's a irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a self watering system that
you put, put a little emitter in each pot
[SPEAKER_03]: or down the line of the raised bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you turn on a motor and it just
sucks all the water out of the tank and
[SPEAKER_03]: gives each plant the exact same amount of
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It cuts the watering time from like an
hour and a half to about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The time it takes you to build that system
saves you so much time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been telling all of the listeners
that we're going to talk about building a
[SPEAKER_04]: watering system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just teased it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got it halfway written, like I've got
about halfway written.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of very specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for your needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a guideline written.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll, we'll put that out pretty soon
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can record that one and like,
it'll take me less than an hour or so to
[SPEAKER_04]: sit down and do that one night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys, that one's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: How to build your own irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I think that if you've got eight
plants or 108 plants or 800 plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think an irrigation system could be very
useful for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it sometimes when I'm away,
I'm like, Oh God, I want to just go home
[SPEAKER_04]: and check on the plants and see if they're
dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to go home and check on the
plants and see if they're dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I, when I had the larger grow,
I just want to, I would go to Denver for
[SPEAKER_04]: shows and on the way back, I would stop it
to grow and check on the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how a CDI was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause some shit can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it will clog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually your, your watering system is
going to clog up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to mess with it,
but we'll talk about building one of
[SPEAKER_04]: those.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter how many plants you're running,
it can definitely save you a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you don't have a lot of room
to walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you want to blow out of room,
dude, I'm six foot five and in a
[SPEAKER_04]: residential girl lights hanging at about,
I don't know, probably they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're about six foot down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, walking through stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'd leave people like,
what's with the walkway?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not growing cement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, we're going to be as big as
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I put my dreads in a giant bun
and now I'm like seven feet tall at that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, I'm fun in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't wear too baggy of clothes
because I get hung up on everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I wish I could shrink up a little bit
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm glad to be this, this gigantic
look like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you shout it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty, Frosty, we want to get you on the
show, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do some no-till stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do some no-till stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've talked about your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about you moving, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you came out here because we made
good friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I came out here too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We both got a kind of blondish,
almost slightly ginger reddish hair,
[SPEAKER_04]: big freaking Viking beers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We both showed up barefoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we made good friends, made great
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, since you're on a microphone,
dude, and you got free rein in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's talk about what you're going to do
next, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got any huge plans for the world?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I did, um, me and a buddy of mine just
bought some property, um, down south,
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple, about five acres of land in,
uh, costilla County, um, filling out some
[SPEAKER_03]: permits and stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, we'll see where it takes us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just getting some stuff done out there
and barefoot farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hoping to get a little barefoot,
a barefoot ranch, barefoot farms,
[SPEAKER_03]: get a couple of hoop houses or something
going on out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a pretty prime, pretty prime
little, little plot of land to do it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pretty soon you'll be opening them up,
opening up some coffee shops or bowling
[SPEAKER_04]: alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of some inside jokes between us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some funny shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys get some coffee shops,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a good investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Invest in coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just random stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't invest in coffee shops and be
mad when, when you don't make the money
[SPEAKER_04]: that you thought you were going to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of being, being facetious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is the word.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going for like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my listeners kind of dip out
around 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, man, thanks for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take some dabs here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some, uh, you guys are going to
laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I've got some blue dream shatter that
is pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we just had the last of the blue
dream shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just took the last couple dabs of blue
dream shatter and it made us chatty and it
[SPEAKER_04]: made us have a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the blue dream shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you know me, you know how I feel
about blue dream hashtag blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to grow blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to smoke blue dream flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to see blue dream at the
dispensary, but that somebody was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: look, I got some blue dream shatter for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually, it did a damn good
job.

it.
