[SPEAKER_00]: to make it nice and easy for all of my

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the main topic of this
podcast, I do have a couple of things I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to remind you of and talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the first order of business is
the Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, there's a Black Friday sale
coming up on the iRead Genetics web store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking for t-shirts,
grinders, rolling trays and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, I will be doing a Black Friday,
Cyber Monday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to stay updated on that sale
is to join the newsletter.

.com, there's a spot for you to type in
[SPEAKER_00]: your email address and join the newsletter
that will get you signed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do post that sale, you will get
updated, you will get a link, you will get
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is a sale going on for
the patrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the notification first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out Patreon.com forward slash
Grow From Your Heart to get early access
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to talk about is if
you are sending seeds to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, if they are going in the mail
and they are traveling in the mail,
[SPEAKER_00]: please put those seeds in some sort of
protective container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not believe how many people
allegedly, possibly, hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe send me seeds to test or just as
samples or just as gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seven out of ten times, they put those
seeds in just some shitty baggy,
[SPEAKER_00]: some lackluster packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get here, they are crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the mail we get goes through
rollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly the process at the
post office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gone back there and had a tour,
but I have seen videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a little bit of how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the packages go through two
rollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get moved down by little
rollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like two rolling pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your seeds go through those,
they get flattened and squished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are going to send anybody seeds,
please put them in some sort of protective
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little containers are very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to send a lot of seeds,
just order a couple of packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or make something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to make a package,
use a priority mailbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't get crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, let's protect these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting gifts, but it is really
heartbreaking to open up my gift and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a baggy of seed dust with the label
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, these would have been
amazing fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is this crossed to this, which is very
rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is all of the seeds I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't believe how many times I
have opened up packages and found crushed
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any seed that I send out, any seed that
allegedly comes from me or gets shipped in
[SPEAKER_00]: any way is put into a protective
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows that you care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows that you are thinking about the
person you are either selling,
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing, giving to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of time, effort and energy
and money thought into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just protect the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will quit rambling about protecting the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's really important,
especially as a seed vendor, a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of seeds that are poorly
packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's package them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted your name set on the show,
I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a shout out, send me a
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I enjoy your
podcast and your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and growing your wares.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I was wondering if you could
consider a podcast about terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that the presence, absence or
mixtures of the various terpenes in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant are known to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question, a very good
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to jump into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, most strains seem to have a
number of terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a combination in most
strains, but it's pretty clear that the
[SPEAKER_00]: high limonene in a product gives me bit of
an edgy, heart racy effect as lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: sunrise demonstrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is that limonene buzz is what I
really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a traumatic brain injury,
so I'm not sure how much I've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: this on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how many episodes you have
listened to, so I'll give you a brief
[SPEAKER_00]: update.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, I suffered a traumatic brain
injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was knocked unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while I was out, I fell down the
stairs on my way down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smacked the back of my head on the
stairs several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were really not good for my brain
and for my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain and body were not sending the
right signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would forget that I was hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go two days without eating,
and then my friends would hear my stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: grumble, and they'd say, hey, bro,
are you hungry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, I don't know, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd give me food, and I would eat like
a fucking savage, like I'd been a hostage
[SPEAKER_00]: for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't getting the right signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that I was hot and cold the
right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get really thirsty and not realize
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lips and teeth and tongue would be all
stuck together, and my friends would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, bro, you look like Fire Marshal Bill
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drink some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, oh, I didn't even realize
I was thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having major problems with my
traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I started to heal and come back around,
I noticed that I had sort of a skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from the 90s, you remember we
used to have CDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to listen to our music on CDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those CDs would get a skip or a
scratch on them, and you would play it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would just have a little skip or a
little scratch in the same spot every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd be listening to a song,
and it would be boom, chick, boom,
[SPEAKER_00]: chick, skip, boom, chick, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go right back to the song.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would almost remember that there's a
skip in that one part of the song on your
[SPEAKER_00]: CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd just be embedded in your memory as
part of the song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sometimes I experience that type of
a skip in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll feel like that there's just something
skip, something skip, something is
[SPEAKER_00]: skipping in my brain, and you got to kind
of like give it a fonzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to nudge it, and then it'll
jump right back in and get going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that high limonene flowers
and concentrates will kind of help with
[SPEAKER_00]: that skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it cleans off the scratch on
my record or my CD or it takes off
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever was in the way, and it makes me
feel flow a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes out the ticks and the skips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I absolutely understand that limonene
can be very beneficial medicinally to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you that panicky,
racy sort of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that panicky, racy sort of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of fixes me, and then also I get
high from it, and it makes me forget that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how limonene gets to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is going to be affected
differently by terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that is later in my
notes, but let me jump to that part now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are going to affect people
differently just like any other medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: does, just like brain chemistry and body
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people that can drink four
cups of coffee and act normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I drink one cup of coffee, I act like
Beavis, and I spin around for about 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, and then I take a big poop and a
nap, and I got to sleep after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just body chemistry, brain chemistry,
the way that things affect us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my experience with terpenes may be
different than a lot of other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, other than the
limonene, it says, and any significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of mercine will soon render me
unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of terps that send you
up, and also there are a few terps that
[SPEAKER_00]: will send you down and mellow you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in my experience,
let me make a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is something that I wanted to make
sure to include in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not qualified to give a scientific
talk about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to fake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bullshit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about the scientific part of
terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do know is how aromas and flavors
in cannabis benefit me, and how I select
[SPEAKER_00]: my cannabis and my concentrates by aroma
because I know that my nose knows,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to make it clear that I don't
have any sort of science education,
[SPEAKER_00]: any degree, any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I'm talking about is from my
personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you the compounds of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you what makes a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be completely honest with you
that I don't have that education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about what I do know and
explain it the way that I do know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's something I think is my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke, I think that the cannabinoid
is, let's say it's a firework,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that smoking is fireworks,
and when I take a dab, the THC is how high
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to shoot into the sky,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a dab, and if there's low amounts
of THC, I'm only going to lift off so
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's high amounts of THC,
we're going real high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my fuel, my rocket power
in my dab or in my smoke is the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think that the terpenes are the
colors of my fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are my fireworks going to be green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be red?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those colors are the effects, in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get the munchies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get the giggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get paranoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get pain relief?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get a panic attack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the, that's what the terpenes
brings to my smoke, to my concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the THC, that shoots me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are the type of buzz that I
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get the giggles,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get paranoid as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all about the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we think too much about
indica and sativa and we don't focus
[SPEAKER_00]: enough on the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that I just basically implied
that we should focus more on terpenes when
[SPEAKER_00]: we are selecting our products,
but at the same time, I don't know a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't bothered to learn what every
terpene smells like, what the effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities of every terpene are,
because when I'm talking to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people I talk to don't speak
terpenese.
[SPEAKER_00]: They speak normal languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, I can't say, hey, this product
really smells like linalool or this
[SPEAKER_00]: product really smells like mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are going to have to Google
that and I'm not doing them any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to, then they're going to go
to Google and they're going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, linalool, that probably smells like
lavender, citrus, and laurel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have just gotten right to the
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, this herb smells like lavender
and citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been more beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love terps and I love talking about
terps, but I oftentimes skip all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: technical stuff because how many people
out there want to hear, oh, it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: linalool and it smells like this percent
of linalool and this much mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want me to say it smells like
chocolate or it smells like gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out there knows what chocolate
and gas smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get memories in your mouth and in your
brain and in your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say chocolate, you go, chocolate,
you could smell different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different textures of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives me options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say linalool, you got to Google it
and figure out what that even is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I've never had a machine
come back and say, Hey, can I get more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that high linalool product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people say, Hey, do you have any
more of that herb that smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: cherries and feet?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's much more, uh,
just practical for me to talk in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas that are familiar
instead of being technical about linalool,
[SPEAKER_00]: carofeline and words like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does sound cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me look pro, but I lose my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those fancy terpene descriptions
are great for the medical industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my nose doesn't care what linalool,
mercine, any of that stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose goes, Ooh, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's something in us
just primally that knows what our body
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, that's why poop stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why oranges smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to eat poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nature, whatever you believe in nature,
God, Jah, son, whatever, whoever you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about, whatever you believe in
made poop stinks so that we don't eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to put that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell it from far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less healthy it is, the worse it
stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, God, that shit smells so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could smell from 10 feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk through an orange grove,
you go, Ooh, unless you're allergic to
[SPEAKER_00]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know people that are definitely
allergic to oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for this, but if you're into
oranges, you walk through the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: grove, you go, that smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just want to eat them because
oranges are good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some sugar in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got vitamin C in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oranges are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you some vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when you smell good food,
your mouth starts watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why when you smell poop,
you want to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the terps and cannabis do the
same thing to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the budtender opens a jar,
your brain doesn't go, Ooh, linalool,
[SPEAKER_00]: emersine, carafaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you nerds out there and I love you
nerds for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always categories of nerds in the
weed industry, but most people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how your brain is going to respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to go, Hmm,
berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's most likely the one that is going
to give you the effects that you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that you're going to enjoy the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got a full podcast that is
titled follow your nose because I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the readouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the graphs, but your nose knows
what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your nose is the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose and your nose are different
because your body can chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body chemistry are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our needs might be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our recreational and medical needs for
cannabis might be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I like to smoke
myself into a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of friends that like to smoke
themselves into a coma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what you're desiring for
the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me catch up on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm not asking for a biochemistry
lesson or anything, just your own
[SPEAKER_00]: observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great because honestly,
like I said before, I don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifications to give you the actual
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know through, uh, experience that,
uh, the cannabinoids seem to make me go up
[SPEAKER_00]: and the terpenes seem to dictate the color
and direction of my buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best way I can describe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few more notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that I cover,
uh, follow your nose is one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one last part to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, again, thanks for the genetics
and the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to my next seed run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a guy can't grow out a pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fathered by King Solomon without finding
at least one keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that you were finding at
least one keeper in every pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that you run for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you for the great email and
the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you or anybody else out there has any
questions, corrections, comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: or concerns, you know, I would love to
