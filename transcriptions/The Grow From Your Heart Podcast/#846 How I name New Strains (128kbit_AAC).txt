[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast party people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.

heart podcast.

lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.

[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about those free seeds

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I don't want to waste too much
time here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the question and
answer a portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of that website, there is a tab
that says grow help or grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab, you can send me
your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds off of ireadirect
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first question came from our new
friend Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like this question a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Brian, make sure you check your
inbox because you've got a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds from ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, Yo Rasta Jeff,
how do you come up with the names of your
[SPEAKER_00]: strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may not know that not only am
I a podcaster, but I am also the head
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder and sole proprietor of iregenetics
premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of regular and feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're new here, that just catches
you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one that makes the decisions on
what to breed, how to breed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when to breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the funnest part of the whole job is
deciding how to name those new creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Brian wants to know,
how do you come up with those names?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countless ways that I am
inspired by strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them you may have noticed are
Grateful Dead songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a deadhead, a dead fan since
about 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of Grateful Dead culture
in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named strains after the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow, Franklin's Tower,
Scarlet Bagonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were all Grateful Dead songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the first three to pop off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I named stuff after fish songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Character Zero is a fish song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maze was named after a fish song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhombus is not a fish song, but it is
named after some fish lore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the fish comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhombus is a fish thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday Show is kind of a nod to the entire
Jam Band culture and the Jam Band world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say never miss a Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go see your favorite Jam Band on
Sunday, you will get a special
[SPEAKER_00]: performance, a special show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like church.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a family gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunday Show became a strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I named stuff after the Ninja Turtles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael,
Michelangelo, Bebop, Rocksteady,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shredder, April O'Neal, Baxter Stockman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, of course, were all inspired by one
of my childhood favorite cartoons,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, currently, another line that I've
recently put out is named after another
[SPEAKER_00]: pop culture icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Rose, Sophia, Dorothy,
and I always skip one of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, the four golden girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose, Sophia, Dorothy, and there's
Blanche.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we forget Blanche, that hussy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the four golden girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are named after, of course,
the golden girls sitcom TV show from when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frequency Shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is Frequency Shift named?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very into a reggae artist named
Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a beautiful person, amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: She makes great music.
[SPEAKER_00]: She sings fucking amazingly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also is very spiritual person,
a very energetic person, a very positive
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she comes into the room,
there is a frequency shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I named the strain Frequency Shift in
honor of my friend Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain Jammy was named after my friend
Jamiri Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: His nickname is Jammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a strain based on the traits that
he likes, and I named it Jammy because his
[SPEAKER_00]: family calls him Jammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Jamiri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about other strains off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I call fist bump?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see, when I see some friends,
when other dreads see each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: just give each other a quick fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought fist bump was a cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of other strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is another Redline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked earlier about how Redline got its
name on a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called Redline Redline because when I
smoke it, my eyes get bloody red and real
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I used to ride bicycles when I was a
teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rode GT bicycles, but Redline bikes were
real popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redline's got red Lebanese hash plant in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of it comes from pop culture
references.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it, the names just create
themselves like Bubble Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Goat is Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Gum and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Goat, that name made itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kind of names make themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peggy O was another one named after a
Grateful Dead song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just random stuff,
but sometimes it's just things that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to, it just tells you what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Goat, like I was saying,
it's just Bubble Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on cultural references.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on maybe just telling you the
names of the two strains together will
[SPEAKER_00]: describe, will make a perfect name for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Goat, Gorilla Goat, I'm sure
there's more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a friend will say something
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, Mike was talking and he said
something about the word afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, bro, quit talking because that
is a strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote down afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got a strain called afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow, the old strain Storm Shadow,
that was named after a G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe character, Storm Shadow, the Silent
Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of strains that are
available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we come up with Congo Ripper?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Congo to Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be fairly obvious there how
those came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitechapel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitechapel is Golden Goat and Jack the
Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper was a famous murderer,
a famous serial killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Whitechapel killer is also what he was
known as.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got known as Whitechapel as the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm inspired by a lot of different random
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll smoke a strain and get a
certain flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I try to honor the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just a pop culture
reference or some sort of energy thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I thought of that I thought of when I
smoked that strain or that the two names
[SPEAKER_00]: made me think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just totally completely
random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes sometimes I don't have a name in
mind until I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I've already got a strain name
in mind when I create the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that orangegasm was going to be
super delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make your toes curl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have that beautiful orange
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm was that just happened
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all just kind of depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a list of strain names if
something cool comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a video game name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuketown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain Nuketown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from I used to play Black Ops
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call of Duty Black Ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mike for getting me addicted
to video games for a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss playing video games with you,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I used to play Black Ops and Nuketown
was the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to play any sort of video
game, Nuketown 24-7 or on the holidays was
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to camp up in that one bedroom
and just snipe little kids that are new to
[SPEAKER_00]: the game all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't like campers,
you definitely don't want to play a
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting game with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is where Nuketown came from is
the video game from Black Ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Nuketown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a billion more strain
names that I could give you names for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical cocktail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I call it chemical cocktail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got chem dog in there and it's got
the chem dog aroma comes through,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also smells a little bit like if
you took a kiwi strawberry Snapple and put
[SPEAKER_00]: some chemicals inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good, but it's also like some
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you work at a nuclear plant and
you're having lunch break and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking something fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I feel like I may grow a third
arm or something from drinking this
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical cocktail, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candylicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is candylicious?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like what does that even
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Candylicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is delicious and tastes like
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candylicious, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get creative in this day and
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the names are taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do my due diligence and research
a name and think about it like somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else used this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there another weird reference?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do my research and then you
wouldn't believe how many times other
[SPEAKER_00]: people come up and they say hey bro that
this one's already taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that happens and I apologize and
usually I just stop making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the name Big Mountain Fudge Cake
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've ever revealed this
publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite cartoons, TV shows back
in the day was of course King of the Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: King of the Hill was an awesome cartoon
animated series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, shout out to Hank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Bobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Peggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire King of the Hill family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the little dog Lady Bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a whole shout out to Luan even if we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway let's get back to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the show King of the Hill they started
a band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the band was Big Mountain
Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They referred to themselves as The Fudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it'd be really fun to name a
strain Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they took a strain with some
chocolate turps in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the names are random and sporadic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have the names in mind before
I even make a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't even think of the name
until after I smoke the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a long list of strain names and
I go through it and I'm super picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A strain name can make or break your
creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may buy 2,500 packs of a pack of
seeds just because of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not buy any of it because of the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think Scarlet Bagonias,
if it would have been named something
[SPEAKER_00]: differently, it would have sold better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one was slept on simply
because of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lady tell me that she did not like
my strain name Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another one we can touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bounty Killer was named after a reggae
artist named Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simply where that name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kalonji Kush was named after a reggae
artist called Sizzla Kalonji.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capleton was named after a reggae artist
called Capleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can see where this is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I named a lot of stuff after Grateful
Dead songs, Fish songs, reggae artists,
[SPEAKER_00]: things are named after people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the strain names are kind of
jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sokka Souffle and The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck is that about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you have probably caught on now
that I'm a huge comedy fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laughter is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love music and comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But The Machine is named after Burt
Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his most famous bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tears off his shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He yells, I'm The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking where that name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sokka Souffle came from an episode of Your
Mom's House, not just an episode of Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom's House, but also the host of Your
Mom's House podcast, Tom Segura,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best comedians on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went on Larry King, you know,
the old guy that used to wear the
[SPEAKER_00]: suspenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace if he's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Larry King wore the suspenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Larry King asked Tom, Tom Segura,
what his, um, like a weakness,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your weaknesses, your, um,
anyway, he asked him what a weakness was,
[SPEAKER_00]: like one of his, his personal weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the fuck name of the thing that
he asked him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a trait, but he's like,
what's one of your weaknesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said chocolate souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Larry King's a fucking 124 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said Sokka Souffle with a big question
mark and a dumbfounded voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to that, Tom Segura just smiled
back and said chocolate souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Larry King got it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sokka Souffle was a made up word that
Larry King said one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how Sokka Souffle became.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first hundred packs of that strain
that I sold came in a package with an
[SPEAKER_00]: image of Larry King with his suspenders
and his microphone in front of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were two of his iconic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first hundred packs of the machine I
sold also came in a custom package with a
[SPEAKER_00]: silhouette of Bert Kreischer holding a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do the silhouette.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to do any copyright,
copyright violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were two strains that sometimes
I had to explain the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another strain that people ask me about a
lot, the strain name is double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paula.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is double Paula?
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Paula is a strain that I made
around 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say circa 2016, 2018,
somewhere in that time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when double Paula was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me a lot of questions about
double Paula.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that one around 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows kind of tall, kind of quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, strong turps on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's double Paula.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue to get questions
because I ain't going to tell you shit
[SPEAKER_00]: about double Paula right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the mystery around double Paula.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful, amazing strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regular seed sold out quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumor has it there might be feminized
seeds of that double Paula coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me rambling for at least 10 good
minutes about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there were a lot more that I
wanted to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably hit pause, go to the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about a billion strain
names, but the strain names aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired by just like music, just like
art, just the things in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ninja Turtles, G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, video games, reggae artists,
Grateful Dead songs, fish songs,
[SPEAKER_00]: just random references to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinfoil hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I call tinfoil hat tinfoil hat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it makes you paranoid when you
smoke too much tinfoil hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're peeking out the windows and shit,
thinking shit's going on that's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a famous podcast called
Tinfoil Hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hosted by Sam Tripoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a little nod, a little shout out
to Sam Tripoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's tinfoil hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of them, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me talk about Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will wrap up this part because I
feel like I really want to give a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is Bobby Knight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Knight is a Bobby Knight is past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Knight was a basketball coach for
Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandparents both came from Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were what you call Hoosiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were into Hoosier basketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my grandparents both knew Bobby Knight
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They followed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a big basketball family.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandparents, my uncles loved
basketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five and everyone's
disappointed that I don't give a shit
[SPEAKER_00]: about basketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can shoot, but I don't care to play D at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just stand there and watch everybody
score on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go try to shoot my own shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting sidetracked anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandparents were Indiana basketball
fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Knight was a coach for Indiana
basketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a hold of the Indiana bubblegum,
the classic bubblegum strain that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed the Indiana bubblegum to
afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right as those seeds were coming to
fruition and almost ready to harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Knight passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like something just told me,
name the strain Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gave me a way to honor my
grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me a cool strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to honor Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the basketball fans knew
what it was right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the Indiana basketball fans
definitely knew what it was right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bobby Knight was named after a
basketball coach from Indiana and my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents were from Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were a couple of my favorite
people, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they inspired me in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to pay some sort of tribute to my
grandparents by naming a ganja strain sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of after them, but it's Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have their name in it or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not implemented in my business
here, but it's a nod.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shout out to my grandparents and
also, of course, Bobby Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, to that Indiana background
that is in my blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new friend, Brian, dude, make sure you
check your inbox, check your spam,
[SPEAKER_00]: because by the time this episode comes
out, you have got a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds from I read direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this momentum moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, before we jump into the next
one, let me remind you to like and

[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend, Polly Figgs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a Polly Figgs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also came from that grow help tab on
I redirect, which means Polly Figgs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you win a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds off of I read direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your inbox,
check that spam.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the messages do go to the
spam folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one more quick disclaimer,
those coupon codes do expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those gift certificates do expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people ask me, is that expiration
date real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that expiration date is real as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to use that coupon code by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't use it by then, it tells me a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't check your spam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it tells me you didn't listen to the
podcast because if you listen to the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would know that you got your message
read, which would then tell you to go
[SPEAKER_00]: check your inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you didn't get it, you snooze,
you lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot resend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Polly Figgs, go check your inbox,
get that coupon code for your free seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: at I redirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says Rasta Jeff, what are
your thoughts on clone degeneration from
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way to revive or rejuvenate old
clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you mean like rejuvenate an old
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me first touch on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said degeneration clone degeneration is
a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes mother plants get tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get old.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you abuse a plant, if you don't give it
the best care, if it's threatened with
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs or problems or inadequate
environment, sometimes these plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: get old and tired and stop performing the
way that they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what this listener means by
degeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call it genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a different thing completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full podcast on genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis world, we are using the
phrase, the term genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccurately, incorrectly, as we do many
terms in this industry, in this business,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, today I want to make sure we are
not talking about genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what this listener is
referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is degeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a plant starts getting old and tired,
it happens with every living organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, if you don't give it the ideal
diet environment, if it faces any threats,
[SPEAKER_00]: any problems, pests or pathogens,
or it could be a lot of other things at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time, overwatering, underwatering,
a lot of stress on this planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant can cause future generations to
not be as healthy as they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics will be exactly the same,
but the overall health of the new cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be as optimal as previous
generations of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this listener is saying, is there a way
to revive or rejuvenate these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I feel like we have already
surpassed this time of the year unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some supplemental lighting that
may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what many breeders and growers are
known to do is, when the right time of
[SPEAKER_00]: year comes around, you can put small
copies of your plants outdoors and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them out there in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sunshine will rejuvenate,
revive, and correct many of the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that your plants may be experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably said it on the podcast a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun works wonders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is the fixer, the healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun will cure a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put a small plant outside,
if you can veg a plant or get a small
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, even if you got a large plant,
put it outside, veg it, let it be outside
[SPEAKER_00]: for a week, maybe two weeks, you will see
great improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you put that plant out at the
proper time of year, that depends on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you live, your location geographically,
geographically, that word was easy to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your location on the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in certain regions, you could do
this all year long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, you've got about a
three or four week window where this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a greenhouse where you can
provide supplemental lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: this would work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it out there just about any time that
it's not too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that sunshine on it for a few hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you correct the plant,
add some artificial light to go with that
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine, and you will see improvements in
the health of that plant overall in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you do need to feed the plant
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also make sure not to get any,
you need to make sure not to acquire any
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, any pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to take more pests indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could just lead to a whole other slew
of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the near future, we are going to talk
about integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that came up today on the
Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is on my mind to talk about in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a way to rejuvenate clones that have
gotten old, that have gotten dusty,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just don't seem to be as healthy as
they once were, put them outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them plenty of light, get them going
outdoors, get that sunshine on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed them well, let them feel that outdoor
environment, and they will come back
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get healthy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work for most plants that are
just a little bit beat up looking old.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're beat to shit, and if they're
supposed to die sometimes, you just got to
[SPEAKER_00]: let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have been taking better care of
that plant overall if it was that
[SPEAKER_00]: important to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend Polly Figs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see a message from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great too.
