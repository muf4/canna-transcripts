[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 425 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the podcast
off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of George
Washington OG Ambrosia from Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this product contains 69.9%
THC, 0% CBD, and 84.3% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack the jar open and give
it a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when I open it, the first thing to
hit my face is a pungent, gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuely sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting it closer to my face now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a real smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second smell that comes in is sort of
a banana type of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost smells as if I took banana runts
and soaked them in gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a sweetness at the end,
maybe a bit of earthiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the unique flavor from the
George Washington OG Ambrosia from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up this concentrate at the Pueblo
location on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a recreational and a medical
dispensary in the same building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to read a
couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's cover a few
shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I owe a big shout out to my
friend, Miss Melville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out to Tommy,
a giant shout out to Paul T.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a giant shout out to my buddy
Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, another giant shout out to my
friend, Matthew KW, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: a giant Dude Grows crew and a Grow From
Your Heart podcast and an iry army shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my friend, Stabby McStaberson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and much respect for all the
support to everybody who helps out on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to become a
patron, you can do so by going to Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the email portion of
this episode, I want to give a giant thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you and a shout out to a couple of friends
of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big thank you and a big shout out
to my friends, JR Token and Q Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: JR Token and Q Grows are heavily involved
in the creation of a new application
[SPEAKER_00]: called Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a social media application
aimed at the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They encourage and appreciate you posting
cannabis related material on their social
[SPEAKER_00]: media platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me and my friends Q Grows and JR
Token and a whole bunch of the other iry
[SPEAKER_00]: army and Dude Grows crew members over at
Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just like most social media
applications, except it is cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly and you don't have to worry about
your account getting deleted because you
[SPEAKER_00]: are posting cannabis related content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me over there on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still on Instagram, but you never
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram has been deleting cannabis
accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took down my account for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blessed enough to get that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does disappear, I will not disappear
from Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out once again to our friends Q
Grows, JR Token, and again, a big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to everybody who's been interacting
with me and following me over there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: new app Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: activists and dab cadets, I don't know
what I'm saying anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy creating listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading your email on the show,
answering your question lets me know that
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at least helping one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if one person has this
question, there are probably several
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there with this question,
or maybe I can at least spark some ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: or prevent some future problems in
people's grows by reading listener
[SPEAKER_00]: generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a question, if you've got
a cannabis culture, a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, any sort of a cannabis
community related question, please send it
[SPEAKER_00]: to me at grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will work your question into a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in this episode goes a lot
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of your podcast listeners from
down here in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have recently ran into an issue
in my garden and I do not really know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do to give some backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a small indoor setup, so we're
growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says I have an area all set up for my
clones and seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a two by four veg tent and I have a
four by four flowering tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you have a nice little
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far everything makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says up until recently, I have never
had any bug issues at all in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cropped my last run and had
absolutely no bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, I of course had to
do some transplanting to get my next run
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do a deep clean when I reset my
garden on every single surface in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take just regular indoor outdoor
bug spray and just spray along the walls
[SPEAKER_00]: and windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that works or not, I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you just harvested,
you have cleaned up the room properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you clean every surface in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says you take some indoor outdoor
bug spray and spray it along the walls and
[SPEAKER_00]: windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that's doing anything or
if it's necessary, but it probably just
[SPEAKER_00]: feels good to know that you've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on what product you
used, what type of pesticides you were
[SPEAKER_00]: applying, if that's going to do anything
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue with the email because
there is more it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward to my transplant day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped a few new beans for a new run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just finished cropping so it was
time to move my veg into my flower tent
[SPEAKER_00]: and my new seedlings needed to go into
solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far I'm following you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For soil, I like to use Fox Farm with
their Fox Farm soil conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I store my soil in three different large
Rubbermaid containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I store the soil in the bag in the
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also store the conditioner in the bag in
the container and I have one container
[SPEAKER_00]: with already mixed product ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far you've got some big Rubbermaid
totes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that for storage and then
you've got one that's mixed up ready to go
[SPEAKER_00]: for when you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am following you along so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is where we're going to
get applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolate the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's identify the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we know what kind of pests we have,
we can work on a strategy to eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I could not, for the life of me,
figure out how they possibly could have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, of course, automatically assumed that
they were root aphids, which was verified
[SPEAKER_00]: by my local hydro store from PICS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had my doubts because I could not
find any of the tell-tale signs that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were in fact root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a random note here, aphids have
tailpipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the tailpipes on an aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a couple of people out
there thinking I just lost my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, go Google an aphid the next time you
see an aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at an aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see the tailpipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the message because it
is starting to get long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, no tell-tale signs they were in
fact root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are under my microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it looked too small to be an aphid
and it looked more like a predator mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: After some research, I came across two
predatory mites that these bugs resemble
[SPEAKER_00]: the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, he used the full fancy name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first predator he listed that he
thinks this could possibly be is the
[SPEAKER_00]: californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one that he listed was the
philassus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did avoid using the full Greek
species name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to listen to me stumble
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it sounds like we have identified the
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to worry about them being
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in there sucking juices out of
our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in there potentially spreading
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hopefully identified them
correctly and we have got what can be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial predatory mites in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should not be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I could not figure out how I got
them or where they came from because I
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't brought anything new into my garden
for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil I had was not recently
brought into my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should check my soil containers
just to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had infested all three of my soil
storage containers I use for soil and mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to thinking that they could not
be root aphids because the soil in which
[SPEAKER_00]: they are living has not had plants or
roots growing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this correct thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say that is correct
thinking, but there could be some organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in that medium that the bugs are
still surviving off of for a short period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far it sounds like you have
correctly identified them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like a smart person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are making a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are smart enough to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also had a microscope, which makes me
think you're probably an intelligent
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most average people don't have a
microscope laying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got one, that you had access
to that easily, you're probably somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who is interested in higher education,
somebody who is interested in advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to trust that you can open a
book and identify an insect based on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you have seen in your microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to believe you that these are
not root aphids and they're sucking the
[SPEAKER_00]: juices out of your plant, potentially
spreading diseases in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have faith in your
identification that those are not aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to agree and move forward
acting like those are auditory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a very specific pest
management program, which I created after
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to you, which makes this very
difficult to understand how this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a small fungus snap problem and
I thought that may have attracted them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then that wouldn't explain how or why
they got into my soil that was sealed in
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the fungus snap problem and this
problem were different problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to assume they were possibly
caused by the same source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up and says, after all of that,
I of course do what I always do and scroll
[SPEAKER_00]: through your podcast to try and find a
good one that would help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I listened to one you did about bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that podcast, you mentioned that you
use predatory insects in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all of my research, I have found
that soil mites are supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial and only eat the larva of other
insects, hunt spider mites and other non
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial things living in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have also seen where the population
got out of control in some research I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, should I just leave
them and start flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not seem to be causing any issues
with my plants and they are absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% confined to the soil and do not crawl
onto the plants and there is nothing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the undersides of my leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap up this message by saying,
please feel free to correct anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: I put in this email if it was incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wonderful email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it says I have never seen or heard
of a bug problem such as this so I am at a
[SPEAKER_00]: loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help me if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can help and I am happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very good explanation of what I
will assume happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably tell that a couple of
minutes ago, my throat and my voice
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing a couple of funky things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, we're going to talk
about where I assume these bugs came from
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we need to do about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world through the magic
of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were able to take a fat dab or
take a bong rip or something delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: while I was taking a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were not able to smoke something,
don't worry, because I took enough dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: for two or three people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back into this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question that I wanted to address was
where do you think these bugs came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that these predatory mites
and your fungus gnats from before probably
[SPEAKER_00]: came from a very similar place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that they came from
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to blame Fox Farm soil
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say they come from any
specific brand of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that it would probably be
safe to assume that most of the soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix or soilless media or soil product
purchased at a grow store or a hydro store
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever type of supply store we are
purchasing it from, it all comes from a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many products stored at
those warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the soil is stored in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when orders are placed, they just
grab one pallet of Fox Farms, one pallet
[SPEAKER_00]: of Roots Organic, one pallet of
Playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mix that in the truck with whatever
other shit they got to put and they ship
[SPEAKER_00]: it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the stuff is sitting in one
giant area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one batch of soil is delivered to that
distribution center and it happens to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a soil borne pest in that bag,
there is a potential for that pest or that
[SPEAKER_00]: insect or that life form to reproduce in
that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is going to expand its
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to say, hey, there are a lot of
us, whatever kind of pest it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of us spider mites over
here in this one bag of Fox Farms dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they're going to say, hey,
why don't a bunch of you guys go on a
[SPEAKER_00]: quest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you go explore and go find us
some new territory, some new property?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put together like a little spider
mite expedition crew and they get their
[SPEAKER_00]: little expedition hats on and they get
some fancy boots and some binoculars and
[SPEAKER_00]: some maps and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go out on a quest and they leave
that bag of dirt and they go try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: more area to populate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have to go far because many
of the distribution facilities which work
[SPEAKER_00]: with these large amounts of soil,
they'll have a pallet of Fox Farms sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: right next to a pallet of Roots Organic
sitting right next to a pallet of 707
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting right next to a pallet of whatever
else you were thinking about buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all right there in the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that little expedition crew is going to
go, hey, look, there's a big pile of fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff over there and they're going to go
on there and they're going to infest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to populate that and then
repeat that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you take something into that
shipping and receiving area, that storage
[SPEAKER_00]: area, that distribution center,
wherever it is, they're just going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: around to every bag of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have other places that actually
sell treats and shrubs and flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have bags of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that stuff is stored in a large
backyard area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to, there's a large grow supply
chain in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to their Colorado Springs
location and you say, hey, can I get five
[SPEAKER_00]: bags of this type of dirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, sure, pull up to the back and
they go to the back and they've got all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, all of the soilless mix,
all the perlite, all the stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: is just stored out back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in a gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the rain, under the sun and their
whole backyard shipping, receiving area or
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, soilless mixes, the perlite,
the persolite, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all kept right there in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of potential for life to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give life potential,
it will happen, especially when it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects love to thrive in just the right
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings me to my next part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that you brought these
bugs home in either your soil or your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you mix them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them up into a container and you
are giving them the perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are thriving in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have basically created a luxury hotel
for these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just chilling out in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're repopulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited that this email ended
up with us having predatory mites and not
[SPEAKER_00]: russet mites or spotted mites or something
terrible that is going to devastate the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is easy to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume you say there's no
other way they got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in with either the soil or the
soil conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix them up into your big Rubbermaid
or Tupperware containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that stored somewhere where it
is the perfect environment for those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you said earlier is that the
plants are not showing you any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I said that the
plants are the number one indicator of
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are not showing you any
problems, that is another indicator that
[SPEAKER_00]: these are indeed beneficial insects and
they're not going to cause you problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not do anything about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just let them thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will keep away other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two different types of
predatory insects just naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: in your environment, you are lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, especially commercial
cultivations, especially myself in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: facility late in flower, pay a lot of
money to have these exact bugs sent to us
[SPEAKER_00]: in little packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we pay other people to distribute
them throughout the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of got a bonus gift in your
dirt, in your soil, in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could have been really terrible
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice would to be just let these
insects work themselves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not causing you any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may actually be warding off other
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are working as a preventative at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If another bug shows up and tries to get
in there, they're going to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: nah, bro, we got security.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this little built in army that
showed up on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have claimed this turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not get to come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will eat and destroy anybody that
tries to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will run out of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will stop populating and eventually
they may just disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what they're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's keeping them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what those bugs feast off of
if there is not a presence of other bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to eat, which means once they run
out of other bugs, they may just naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't really change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants look happy, if the garden is
going well, I would keep doing just as you
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said in a previous episode,
the plants are the number one indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will let you know if they're
under stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will let you know if they have
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will let you know when it is
time to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you are confident that you
have correctly identified these insects
[SPEAKER_00]: and as long as those plants are not
showing you any signs of distress,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would continue to do business as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got a great setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've thought it out quite
well and it sounds like you are quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: smart person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep going as long as you are certain
that you have identified that insect
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need help identifying that insect,
I would contact Susan Wainwright Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is known as the bug lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a quality photo of that
bug, she can most likely identify that
[SPEAKER_00]: insect on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is amazing and she is passionate about
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out Susan Wainwright Evans if you
need more guidance on pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying the bug that is in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are several people out
there who have gotten bug problems from
[SPEAKER_00]: products that they have purchased from a
grow store or a hydroponic supply store or
[SPEAKER_00]: a farm store or perhaps maybe even a big
chain store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever they've gotten it, I'm sure
people have gotten problems and they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't even aware that there was a
problem in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the soil or whatever soil
is mixed or whatever medium you are
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do your first pot into that soil,
pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if something flies out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a microscope, go ahead and
check out some of that soil and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything is crawling around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to treat for pests if we
identify them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get out of control, it becomes
harder and more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more pests there are, the worse the
infestation gets, the more challenging it
[SPEAKER_00]: is to break the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm going to suggest that you
start paying close attention to everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that you bring into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start looking at every bag of medium,
every bag of perlite, every bag of peat,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a nice look while you're working
with it, while you're mixing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does something crawl up your arm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does something climb up the baby plants
right when you put it in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anything fly out of the soil or the
soil is mixed when you tap on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the easiest way to identify a pest
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to just start looking more
closely at your soil, your soil is mixed,
[SPEAKER_00]: or any type of medium that can carry a
pest when you bring it into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start paying a little closer
attention from now on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message printed out here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Easter.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to thank you for what you do
and for your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email and thank
you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the compliments, all the praise
that all makes it worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I live in Indiana, which
obviously is a non-legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the closest indoor gardening store to
me is almost two hours away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have the luxury of being able
to walk in and get recommendations from
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced growers about my babies or
products and techniques for my babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pretty much leaves me with two
options, which are the forums where you
[SPEAKER_00]: really have to dig to get solid info you
know you can trust or find a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: such as yourself and kind of latch on to
their techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started listening to the podcast pretty
much from the start and I have had great
[SPEAKER_00]: success by doing what you recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have already saved me a lot of time
and a lot of money for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are people that don't
have resources, people who are isolated,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in locations or situations where
they may not be able to ask for help in
[SPEAKER_00]: their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am happy to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody produce a quality product and
take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it always puts a huge smile on my face
hearing that I have helped somebody save
[SPEAKER_00]: time and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, time is priceless and money is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am in sales and I like to
support and do business with people who do
[SPEAKER_00]: business with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though you haven't done business
with me, you have still helped me
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously, like I have mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, I am wanting to
run an iry strain for my next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish a rise came as a fem seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely be going that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any chance you will ever offer a
feminized arise seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do plan on making feminized arise
seeds in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I have no projected date for that
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow, my breeding projects,
everything is scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spaces are planned, my spaces are
booked all the way through 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got the first crop of 2020 planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of that includes a feminized
arise project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on the list of stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on the goal sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is part of something that I have had in
my mind for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that it would be a hot seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't committed space and time to
that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many other things I want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the consumers want the arise
as a breeder, as the artist here,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the person doing the work and creating
the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not on my mind yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pop into my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pop into my mind and I'll go,
okay, it's time to make those arise fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how a weirdo breeder and a
grower and a cultivator and an artist,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how we work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I will make it, but no promise as
to when.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says also because of my busy work
schedule and just kind of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I am looking for a strain that has
a high THC constant and finishes fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That quick finisher and a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a second, they say if there was
something that finished in eight weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: was consistently 20 plus percent THC,
I would jump all over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really want to be no longer than
nine weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found out the times most breeders
put on their packs are not accurate at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd shoot an email straight
to the breeder and see if I could not get
[SPEAKER_00]: a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I don't care if it's an Indica
sativa hybrid strain and I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering with a 1000 watt HPS and it will
be in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the strain was easy to grow,
that would be a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because some days I may not be able
to check them, but not a must.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say I'm a pretty experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your 420 was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to unpack there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 420 was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep doing what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says best wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say from Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some stuff to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike wants a strain that finishes in eight
or nine weeks and has high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, longer flowering strains
tend to be more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hazes that take a really long time
to finish, those things rip your head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a panic attack, make you
forget where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make you lose your car keys while
they're in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make you lose your sunglasses while
they're on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like things that take a little bit
longer tend to get more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for higher THC,
you may need to be open to a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said eight or nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine weeks is more ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight weeks is a little bit early for high
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said 20 plus percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I am currently breeding for the
market should test over 20% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently if it is grown by an
experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my stuff should hit 25% or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to get close to 30 with
many of my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a test for 35.84% THC from one
of my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen several 33s and 32s.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: High 20s is a regular thing when it comes
to testing my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you insist on having something
that finishes a little bit early from my
[SPEAKER_00]: line, I would recommend Sunkiss or Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is going to be more on the funky
scented side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like dirty feet and incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make some really unique purple and
silvery kind of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great plant to grow indoors
and outdoors, but it does finish a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit earlier than most of my other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closer to the eight or nine week range for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one I would suggest is,
of course, the Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one has a delicious, greasy orange
kind of a tart cherry sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will be done in eight weeks for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss is really easy to grow indoors and
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it will finish in that eight to
nine week time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes will finish right
around eight weeks for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could convince you to go that
extra one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you run eight weeks, you kind of
limit yourself on options of plants which
[SPEAKER_00]: will work in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many more cultivars or variety
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be done in the nine week period
compared to plants that finish in that
[SPEAKER_00]: eight week period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think if you have more time
to grow, you can get more potency and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can also get bigger, fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it were up to me, I would encourage
you to go that nine full week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the next part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have found that the times most
breeders put on their packs are not
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I would shoot an email
straight to the breeder and see if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is a good way to do it,
go straight to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot speak for anybody but myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to put an accurate
representation of the expected flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time on my strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about how I come up with
those projected times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I do it is when I make a new
cross, I run that cross myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take very good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay attention to the flowering times of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow large populations so that I know
what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know the parents of those plants so
I know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got a good idea of how long they
take, how they perform, if there are any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, if they're reliable, once I'm
satisfied with what I see, I send more of
[SPEAKER_00]: them out to my friends and they grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect those people to send me reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get back reports on how many seeds
germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get reports on how quickly the plants
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get reports on how long they vegged the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get reports on how long the plants were
flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get reports on how many males and how
many females were in each pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of information back from my
friends that are testers for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how I determine what numbers to
put on my seed packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from what I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now flowering time can vary from
environment to environment and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: vary from phenotype to phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I try to give about a week
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will say 50 to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, I'll say 56 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what strain I'm working
with and what I have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to be completely honest and
completely reliable when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you strain finishing times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you were planting a garden
and a crop around those times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need things to be done in the time we
expect them to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can throw everything off schedule and
it can cause bigger problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only speaking for myself, I determine
the flowering time that I put on my
[SPEAKER_00]: website or on my packaging based on what I
see from the testers that I run myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends who are also testers run for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be different in your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an LED light, if you've got
CO2, if it's too hot or if it's too cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: things could be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running HPS and you've got a lot
of humidity or if you've got an LED in a
[SPEAKER_00]: really cold room, all of those things are
going to be factors on how long your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main determining factor is,
of course, the genetics and the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could change that by a week to 10
days just with environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can probably speed it up also by
feeding it certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are things we can do to speed up
and slow down these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what's happening in
your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly do my best to be quite accurate
when it comes to listing expected
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a random note that I've mentioned
before, flowering starts the day you turn
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one of week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you're eight or nine week or
maybe 10 or 11, possibly a 12 or even
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when your flowering cycle begins,
is right then when you flip to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is one more paragraph on this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I don't care if the strain is
indica, sativa or hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be flowering with a thousand
watt HPS and it will be in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did recommend a strain for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, I hope your 420 was
fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, my 420 was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a perfect 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not have asked for anything
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, I want to thank you for a great
email.
