[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode 855 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got another great episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we jump into the question and
answer portion of today's show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to give a big shout out to my
friends at the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind enough to invite me on to
be the co host my friend Scotty had to
[SPEAKER_02]: step out of town for a little vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was invited to be the co host of the
dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to dude for being a gracious
host.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my buddy Grambo for being
an awesome producer and a big shout out
[SPEAKER_02]: for Scotty real for taking a day off to
let me co host the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not already following that,
make sure you check out the dude grow show
[SPEAKER_02]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go give them a follow type in dude grow
show Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The newest episode with myself will pop
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it some clicks, some likes,
leave some comments, let them know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most importantly, subscribe to the
dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move into the question
and answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: That website, of course, is I read
genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that website, there's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you send me your grow question and I
read that question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds off of I read direct.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question came from our new
friend to sleepwalk or that's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to sleepwalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've been sleepwalking all
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Hey Rasta, Jeff, I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the podcast and I love your
genetics, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even know you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're sending that much love,
I already know I can love you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says I have a question about the new
clone drop you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what the acclimation procedure
is for your ship clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm betting a lot of the lucky folks who
were able to score would appreciate this
[SPEAKER_02]: info.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he says, unfortunately,
I wasn't able to get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do have a solution for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does I know other sellers have specific
programs for keeping them alive and slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: adjusting them?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is referring to many people may be
confused what this listener viewer is
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently did a little drop of lemon
Jeffrey rooted clones on irie direct.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to sell a few clones on irie
direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do plan to do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This listener said they were not able to
get the clones they did sell out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite quickly, the way to make sure you
get updates when those clones are
[SPEAKER_02]: available is to go to the website,
the same website where you send in those
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to about three quarters of the way down
at the bottom of the page.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a tab that says stay up to date.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little picture of a mailbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you type in your email address,
when I do clone drops, I will send out a
[SPEAKER_02]: newsletter and everybody will get a
newsletter when those clones are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stay up to date and you can get
those clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Patreon does get the first heads up
on new drops, restocks and sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: random coupon codes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check out patreon dot com forward slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also is on irie genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like four websites I've mentioned
in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should chill out and stay focused over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point is, if you want to know when
those clones come out, make sure you join
[SPEAKER_02]: the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you'll get an update.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, of course, Patreon does get the first
heads up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's address the main part of the
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am shipping clones and you can buy
them off of irie direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they arrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you do with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I take care of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all sent via priority mail
express.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I change up the boxes depending
on what is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are always sent priority mail
express so they get to you very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when your package arrives,
I do recommend that you bring it indoors
[SPEAKER_02]: and let it adjust to room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was on the truck and it's really hot
outside, you don't want to open that
[SPEAKER_02]: package when the plant inside there is
really hot and open it into a cool room
[SPEAKER_02]: and the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's really cold, don't open it into a
warm, dry room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let that box sit and adjust to the room
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it adjust and get to room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when you open it, you will find that
there is a baggie, a one gallon baggie
[SPEAKER_02]: inside of that box.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably taped to the box is what
I've begun doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most secure and cost effective
way to ship these clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tape it right to the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a big baggie and it's gently
taped to the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remove that tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that big baggie out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unroll that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just wrapped up once or twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reach inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will find the plant right inside of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the bottom of that plant are very nice
roots that have grown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a paper towel and I moistened it
and I gently wrapped it around those
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just wrapped around, just very gently
wrapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not folded up too technically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a real nice gentle wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably unwrap it and then unfold
it and it should come right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots will be very robust and very
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants that I sent are very healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So carefully unwrap that paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're going to get stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets stuck, put a little water on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just pour a little bottled water on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could spray some water on there if you
prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That paper towel should come right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't, it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gently plant that paper towel and those
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend you remove the excess
paper towel as much as you can and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever's stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can leave it there if you're afraid to
damage those roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then gently plant that paper towel,
the remnants, and the roots right into
[SPEAKER_02]: your medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to soilless mix,
living soil, cocoa, you could just put
[SPEAKER_02]: that paper towel right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will biodegrade quite quickly and it
will not cause you any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just put minimal paper towel in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying throw the whole thing in
there, but if some of it gets stuck,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can trim around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of paper towel will not cause
you any problems when you plant that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first step is getting it out of the
box carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open that box up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the baggie out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open up the baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the plant out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carefully remove that bottom baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wrapped it in a paper towel and then
I put another baggie over that to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: that secure, to keep that moisture in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just gently remove that second baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the paper towel off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then get your medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I recommend, what I would do,
these clones are ready for this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy a bunch of beer cups when I do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just go buy a stack of beer cups from
the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get like 50 of them for a good price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always got them available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut holes in the bottom with my
scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way I've got three drainage holes in
the bottom of my beer cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scoop up some soil or soilless mix,
whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pack it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not tight, but not loose either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it packed in there kind of firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it will make a little cone shape on
the top of the soil so that the cup is
[SPEAKER_02]: round.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the little cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't figure out how to describe that
because just a cone inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll grab a bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get a prop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will make this is a little more
pointy than I would prefer, but we'll make
[SPEAKER_02]: a little cone shape out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what I try to do is take the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those roots of that clone are kind of
shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that my white fingers are those
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to spread them over the top of that
cone so they don't bunch up inside of that
[SPEAKER_02]: new medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want them tightened up in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give them an opportunity to
spread and grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread your roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you want them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I make that little cone shape and I
just lower those roots onto there and hope
[SPEAKER_02]: that it spreads out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get better at it the more you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've only got one clone right
now, but over time you'll practice this
[SPEAKER_02]: and you will get good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will take that cloud one.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I forgot that soil is already
moistened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I filled that cup, I have moistened
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is in the water that I fed it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely recommend we use some sort of
mycos when you're potting these new
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple advantages of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first advantage is those microbes will
help speed up that plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That root growth will go explosive when
the recharge or the powdered mycos or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever other product you do choose to
use, the great white, the orca,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever product you choose, when that
hits those roots, they will explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that comes in contact with the roots
and the water, that will make those roots
[SPEAKER_02]: start to grow very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll get rapid root development,
which will lead to big, fat, healthy plant
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other advantage to using these
microbes is once you build up these
[SPEAKER_02]: colonies of beneficial bacteria that are
good for the plants, the proper microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: those microbes will fight off the bad
microbes, the bad funguses that try to
[SPEAKER_02]: come around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that will be detrimental to the
plant, any pathogens will be prevented by
[SPEAKER_02]: those beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So build up some colonies, get those
going, start with that very first
[SPEAKER_02]: watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the good soils and soilless mixes
we're buying already come with that in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but add a little recharge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, add a little, what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great white, a little bit of the cheap
mycos, a little bit of Azos, whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: micro products you can add in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get them in there and get these
plants a little bit of a head start or
[SPEAKER_02]: even a little bit of a recharge,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we've got our, so these
plants are wet with our micro product in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a little cone shape at the top
of the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to spread those roots right over
that and I'm going to grab another,
[SPEAKER_02]: about a half a handful of dirt and just
set it, set it right on top of that and
[SPEAKER_02]: just tap it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give it a little tap just so that the
plant, just enough to hold the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: upright and then those roots can grow down
and we're not squishing any roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I kind of spin that cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a really smooth technique where I
just take two fingers and tap the dirt
[SPEAKER_02]: down and spin the cup and it only takes me
a couple of seconds to pack all that dirt
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it pressed in firmly but we don't
want to squish the roots and we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow room for that plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need those roots to be able to work
their way through that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it kind of firm, not too tight,
not loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you see that perfect root growth,
you'll understand once you water it all in
[SPEAKER_02]: and it starts to dry and compact by that
next watering, that's right about where
[SPEAKER_02]: you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you water it in, pay attention
it's going to start to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch how it settles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push that dirt in and then maybe add more
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil-less makes whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to top it off after a day
or two after a watering or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's potted now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in this little cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would put it under a veg light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would introduce it slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I recommend you do this with me
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always isolate and what's the word I'm
looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a word, quarantine, a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain could not think of quarantine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I don't have any notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got very minimal notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all just coming out of what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would quarantine this clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime I get a clone from a friend,
a bro, a homie, a clone service,
[SPEAKER_02]: a clone shipper, any clone that comes in,
it honestly sits right here on this table
[SPEAKER_02]: for several days so I can observe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The day it comes in, it gets treated with
nuclear pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apply some crazy shit to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to smoke that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to become a mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to nuke it and make sure there are
no bugs on that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as it comes in, it gets zapped
and then it sits right here on this table
[SPEAKER_02]: for three to five days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can observe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll spray it on that first day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll spray it on that third day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll give it a good observation and
make sure there are no bugs on there
[SPEAKER_02]: before it even makes it into general
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a breeder, as a person who uses my
plants as a business, I cannot risk
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing a pathogen, a pest into my
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that plant sits right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend to you guys, even if it's
coming from me, bro, I'm a reputable clone
[SPEAKER_02]: source, but still quarantine that bad
bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure there are no problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make that your standard operating
procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter who sends you the clones,
bro, pretty girls have problems to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that the clone is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clean that clone up, quarantine it,
isolate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now at this point, I would recommend
adding some light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's just in this room,
I'm going to add some light to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a pretty good light right up
above me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That light puts off quite a bit of light,
enough to keep a clone alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll crank up the studio lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's a window right behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put some sunshine on this clone if I
need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need enough light to keep it going,
keep it growing, keep it healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been in the dark for several days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to go blasting it
immediately with super intense veg light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just set it on the table, give it a little
light, let it adjust, give it a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that plant starts to look a little bit
droopy, a little bit sad, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: they will.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just environment and plants,
it's nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're going to look a little
bit sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it looks droopy, if it looks pissed
off, I recommend getting a baggie like a
[SPEAKER_02]: sandwich baggie or the little bit bigger
than a sandwich baggie and just make a
[SPEAKER_02]: little dome and just slide it right over
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way you can kind of control the
amount of humidity that's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant won't be subjected to so
much airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be able to develop more humidity
inside that dome while it's generating its
[SPEAKER_02]: roots and getting its life started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's starting to look a little bit
sad, a little bit pissy, just take a
[SPEAKER_02]: baggie, slide it right over the top of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to secure it,
use a rubber band at the bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually not even necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just slide it right over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll trap enough moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will help out your problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've gotten it out of the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've built our little pyramid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've moistened the water, built our
pyramid, dropped the plant on top of
[SPEAKER_02]: there, spread the roots, filled up on top
of it so our plant's nice and sturdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Label that cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we should definitely
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got this cup, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your bright red cup, right on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The name of the strain right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just write it real big on there so there's
no chance to forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you get another clone in a couple
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to mix them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you already have more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Label this bad bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you paid money for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not want to lose it, get it
confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a labeled clone and a cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's backfilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have treated it for bugs if you want
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to spray it, I would recommend
spray it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just think just because it came from
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 99.9% sure it's clean, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that's given me a clone that had
bugs on it said, I'm 99% sure it's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that one fucking percent that'll get
you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure that's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quarantine it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it starts to look sad, put a little
baggie over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the big quart bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a quart size bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slide that right over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to generate more humidity in
that dome, more light and more heat is the
[SPEAKER_02]: way to generate that humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a light above it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will start to bring the water up
toward that light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will help you get some humidity in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got your little humidity dome on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to check my notes and see what
else I wrote down that we need to cover
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning my shipping SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots are wrapped in a paper towel and
then double secured into baggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I use an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I'm going to mention
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These come out of an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole time, once the plant is cut
as a clone, it never goes under a dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these didn't require any hardening off
time or whatever you call that when you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to open the dome and let those clones
adjust.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm pretty sure that they
should be pretty hardy when they come out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that baggie when you get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I say only sometimes they're
going to need a baggie to help themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: rejuvenate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also they're coming out of an easy
cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the roots are just exposed and hanging,
but they're super healthy and I keep them
[SPEAKER_02]: secure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to know what to expect if
you do think about ordering a clone from
[SPEAKER_02]: me that says carefully pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the roots are stuck, you could bury the
paper towel, light feeding, lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, veg light, and then slowly
increase that light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even write down quarantine on my
notes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after three to five days, once that
plant shows you that there's no bugs on
[SPEAKER_02]: it, then slowly introduce it to that veg
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a little LED or a T5 light,
that'll be perfect for this little plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slowly introduce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want you to burn,
shock, confuse this plant by putting it
[SPEAKER_02]: under a super bright light and frying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you just paid some funds for
it, so I want it to be a success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to succeed with the products
you buy from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's a clone, if it's a seed,
I want success for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sell you seeds and then I teach you how
to take clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want you to be self-sufficient once
you've got a clone or some seeds to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me make sure I covered everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 99.9% sure, but like I said,
it's always that 1% dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we covered it's only 0.1% at that
point, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody is going to correct me and
I know who it will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I covered that one, my dude,
Sleepwalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody out there, I hope you enjoyed
that quick little SOP on how to take care
[SPEAKER_02]: of those brand new clones when I do ship
them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're trying to get on that
waiting list, if you're trying to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: updates on how to get the clones,
go to iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says join the mailing list or stay up
to date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Type in your email address.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I put out new clones, I will send out
an email that says Lemon Jeffery clones
[SPEAKER_02]: are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly cut some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see today is Saturday is when this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give me 12 days from Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a weird 80s movie title.
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 days from Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's about when those clones should
start popping roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be some lemon Jefferies and
there will be some other surprises that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start talking about more as soon as I
see the little roots and my friend
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleepwalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds at ire direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to keep this rambly
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move and I do have another email here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one also came from that grow help tab
at i read direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I read this, I do want to remind
you, if you like the podcast, click like
[SPEAKER_02]: and click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free and it just takes a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This question came from our new friend,
Leo, and it says, Hey, Rasta, Jeff,
[SPEAKER_02]: when making seeds, do you look for the
same attributes in your reversal plant as
[SPEAKER_02]: you would a stud male?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: People know that I love making feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also known for making very high
quality regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those require different type of pollen
donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a different hunt when I'm hunting
for the feminine stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to smoke those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to see what they taste like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to see what the buzz is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to experience that plant in a
different way than I do those male plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of it's like I've already got
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep doing this chef kiss motion with my
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know what that plant should
taste like and what that flavor should
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to the breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit of a head start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of a I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I already know what chocolate
tastes like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I want to cook something or bake
something, I know when and where and where
[SPEAKER_02]: not to use chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also how breeding works with fem
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get to the part of the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get to the answer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A reversal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm selecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm selecting a male plant for
pollination, I will accept a nine out of a
[SPEAKER_02]: ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would prefer out on a scale of one to
ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would prefer a ten, but a ten to me is
really hard to attain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is that is that's like the most
perfect plant you could ever find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found nearly perfect plants,
but there's always I'm picky, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I would say that a male plant has to
be a nine and that is in plant growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: shape, structure, flowering time,
amount of pollen that it makes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of time it takes to make that
pollen, the flowering time of that male
[SPEAKER_02]: because I let them go nine or ten weeks
and let them I see what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I observe what those flower clusters do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they make colors?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much water does it take?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it is an over drinker?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an under drinker?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much feed does it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay attention to a lot of things when it
comes to selecting a male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me make sure I check my notes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, growth traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shape, structure, flower time,
flower density.
[SPEAKER_02]: That matters on the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these things matter when it comes
to selecting a male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that male plant can be a nine,
but when it comes to selecting a reversal,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that sounds wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm that picky on my male plants,
how can I be that extra picky on the
[SPEAKER_02]: females that are reversed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's how picky I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the male plants can be nines,
these reversals must be tens because we
[SPEAKER_02]: get to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to sample them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to experience them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't I pick a perfect ten?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need that shape, that structure,
that vigor, that resistance to pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: that resistance to pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: People really forget about that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's worried about what does it look
like on Instagram and how much can I get
[SPEAKER_02]: for a pack of it as a grower, as a
breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it pest resistant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it pathogen resistant?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are growing a lot of
outdoor flowers now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to breed stuff that does not catch
the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to breed stuff that doesn't get the
bud mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to make plants that are bug
resistant so people are not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: attacked by pests in their outdoor
gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I'm thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look at that at the females that I'm
going to reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of leaf shape do they have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of basic structure and how do
they grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they get real tall?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they get real stretchy or do they stay
real tight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they support themselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned the same thing in the male
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are the flower clusters?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they real dense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they fluffy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they fox tail-y?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they finger-y?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then also, one of the main things to think
about, one of the most important things I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess that I should have mentioned first
is what is the goal of the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: project?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this pollen donor meet the criteria
of what I'm trying to create?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to use really weird analogies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started using baking earlier so we're
going to stay with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, if I want to make
chocolate muffins, I'm not going to bust
[SPEAKER_02]: out like pastrami.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to go in my chocolate
muffins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I want to breed chocolate,
I know that's fucking wild, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I want to breed chocolate muffins,
I need something muffiny and chocolatey,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't reach for the pastrami stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So find plants that meet the criteria for
your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to make fruity flavored
stuff, skunky flavored stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, this plant's only 50% of
the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: But keep in mind, it's going to be a big
50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be 60, maybe 70%, depending on
how the breeding goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I do want to make pastrami?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to find if I want to make
pastrami, rye, mustard, I need a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that's smells like pastrami and mustard,
a plant that smells like rye, I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: breed those bad bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about that when you are starting
to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want your outcome to look,
smell, taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the buzz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then as the grower, the breeder,
how does it grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it problematic in the fucking grow
room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't want to grow problematic
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a large clientele of home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the people that purchase my seeds
are medical growers that are growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: their medical needs or they're providing
for somebody with a medical condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consuming cannabis will help with
their medical condition and improve the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality of their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of my customers are home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of my clients are people growing for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need and a lot of them are new
growers because I have a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I introduce a lot of new people to
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need a product that is very reliable
and very easy for the new growers of the
[SPEAKER_02]: community to be able to have good success
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something I think about when I'm
growing and breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can knock that plant over and
forget to water it for a couple of days
[SPEAKER_02]: and then go pick it back up and set it
back up and prop it up and it goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, I'm ready to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the plants that I should think
about breeding with because I want people
[SPEAKER_02]: to have good success in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a plant that can take abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one day, one way I find those is and
I've talked about this before,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm involved with commercial cultivation
facilities and I'll go walk through the
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities and I see plants that just
shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that those plants are getting
beat up because those workers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the guys in the facilities are overworked.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many plants are not getting
paid enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know those plants are getting abused
when I see the plants that shine in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I watch how they get abused in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I see the best plants that come
out and I select those as some of my
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to pick stuff that I know can
take some abuse, that can tolerate some
[SPEAKER_02]: drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you forget to water it for a day,
it might be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you overwater it the next day,
it should still be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like plants I can teach you to pop and
twist and lollipop and do all the work
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm keeping that in mind as I'm
selecting for my breeders also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see, let me get back to my notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need them to be better than a regular
male because I can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see all the traits that we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main thing that I wanted to
stress on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to cover all the important details,
the smoke, the buzz, the aroma,
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavor, and then all the growth
traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I've reviewed all those a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says when making fem seeds,
do you look for the same attributes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my bottom line answer on the bottom of
the paper, it says I look for the same
[SPEAKER_02]: attributes and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I started this, my real male donor
plants, my male pollen donor plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: those can be nines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer a nine, a 9.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll accept an 8.5 maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to have some really super traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those male plants can be nines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a really good solid male plant that
meets my criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've gone through the criteria and it
helps me reach the goal of my breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: project, which we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need that solid male.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a reversal, it's got to be a 10
because I already know what it smokes
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you reverse something that isn't
everything you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, you've already smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it's going to taste like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how it's going to get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how much of it you have to smoke
to get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, is there a ceiling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a limit to this plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: The more I smoke, can I just keep getting
higher or do I max out at some point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of plants have a limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the more the Congo ripper,
the more Congo ripper you smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: the higher you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more wingsuit you smoke, the higher
you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the other strains,
it's common just for your biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you smoke to a certain point,
you'll just max out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't get any higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys just saw me full
of panic because my computer screen went
[SPEAKER_02]: bright blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be time for a new MacBook,
patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dude, Leo, I think I answered your
question in great detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I rambled on about this more than
once or twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my dude, make sure you check your inbox
for a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: from irie direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a super rambly mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get one more message.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question out for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one also did come from that grow help
tab on irie genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys go check out irie genetics dot
com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of great links there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link to my discord server.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come join us on discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join the smokers lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take some dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pop on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk a little bit of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hang out almost every day on discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're invited.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to come on camera,
but you can join the smokers on if you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's a link to irie direct where
you can get those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned for a Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you I'm nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This question came from our friend Ozzy
wazzy 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Ozzy wazzy 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also check your inbox because you've got a
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
[SPEAKER_02]: irie direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question goes a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is labeled a problem in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says I was wondering, I've got a
seeded crop and it became infected,
[SPEAKER_02]: infested with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so he's he's got some plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since that time happened, the dreaded
spider mites have showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this has happened to me before.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is solvable.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fixable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may not be as bad as you're
thinking it may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, would this affect the way the
seeds finished?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will they still be vigorous or am I
wasting my time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says the plants are currently
drying to be dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been watching the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after this, would you recommend to
clean?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend to clean my grow
area?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have used a bleach solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks so much for the podcast from
Ozzy wazzy 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you bred some some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the process, those mother plants,
the female plants, were infested with
[SPEAKER_02]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've got the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those seeds should be viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to produce viable,
potent, vigorous plants from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: My true answer is there's only one way to
find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dude, grow some of those seeds and see
what you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no stress in doing a germination
test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many seeds you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you got 30, maybe you got 30,000,
but take 10 percent of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: However many you got, if you got 30,
take three seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just pull 10 percent of your seeds and
fold them up in a wet paper towel and
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate them and see how many sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they sprout, then you've got really
good seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not just keep going with those?
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the 12-12 from seed method that I
talked about on the dude grow show and
[SPEAKER_02]: just run these plants really quickly and
see what you've created.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did your research and did your due
diligence before you made this cross,
[SPEAKER_02]: you may have made some real gold here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So run these seeds, see what you've
created.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do it for the fun of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just see if they germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fun test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Run them on the 12-12 method that I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fun game to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just run them and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a bunch of pictures and see what you
have created.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you may have new gold there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have created the new the new chem
dog, the new golden gull.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have the new girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have the new gelato on your
hands, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what you have done in that
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got two more things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since these plants were infested with
spider mites during the development time,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way my brain thinks is that if you do
that same process multiple times,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you take the F, so you got F1 seeds,
take those F1s and make F2s, but in the
[SPEAKER_02]: process, let those plants get hit with
spider mites again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then take those F2s and breed F3.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're doing it, keep the spider
mites going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever get rid of the mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep them going because what you're
going to do eventually, if you breed
[SPEAKER_02]: properly, if you do the proper selection,
and this is a whole another bracket of
[SPEAKER_02]: this conversation we're not going to have
today, but people will continue this part
[SPEAKER_02]: in the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about how to do this in the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a person that understands
breeding, what you eventually will do is
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll breed plants that are fully
resistant to spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you select the plants that get hit,
so if you fully infest the room with
[SPEAKER_02]: spider mites and you find female plants
that the mites don't touch and then breed
[SPEAKER_02]: to those, and then infest that room with
spider mites again and find the female
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that the mites don't touch and
breed to those, you'll breed out the
[SPEAKER_02]: spider mites out of that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take several generations,
but you could focus on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could definitely make that a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already the first step into like a
23-step process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not start now?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we've talked about the
resistance to spider mites that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we got to talk about cleaning up this
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the bleach will do you just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you have bleached,
used bleach to clean up the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should do it if you've cleaned up
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, bleach is not an integrated pest
management system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've cleaned up the room one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clean for now, but spider mites are
microscopic and they're going to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: crack in the whatever, a crack in the
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where the room is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's in the basement, if it's in a
gigantic facility, if it's in a real tight
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory, those spider mites,
they've already found one crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to keep coming in and
they're going to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're bringing them on your shoes,
on your clothes, if they found their own
[SPEAKER_02]: entryway, if you've got a pet that's
bringing them, they will be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is time to develop an integrated
pest management system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of different ways to do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, as a commercial cultivator,
the most effective, cost-effective,
[SPEAKER_02]: time-effective way is to apply a spray
application of a pesticide once or twice a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say the word pesticide,
people get scared, but there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: great options of products you can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I leave it up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you need to do the research
and find out what strength of pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to use, how organic you want to
stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my own opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to spout most of those right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out of time on the show,
but this is where you get to decide some
[SPEAKER_02]: ethics and think about how you want to do
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How bad do you want to spray these bugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: How often do you want to spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to use some hippie oils,
some preventative shit, or do you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get in there with agricultural pesticides
and spray once and know you're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have to mess with it for one or two
weeks?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things to think about
and also things to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand what you're putting on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand if it's good or acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my rule of thumb is I am in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand the Colorado Department of
Agriculture and the Colorado Marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: Enforcement Division pesticide
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am certified by the Department of
Agriculture as a train the trainer
[SPEAKER_02]: certified pesticide trainer, which means I
can go to a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and train people there on how to
safely handle and apply pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: But make sure you go read all of that
stuff is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn about those pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I was getting at is I go by the
Colorado Department of Agriculture and
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
pesticide application rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a product is banned in the state of
Colorado, I do not use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a product that I use on a regular basis
becomes banned, sometimes I'll remove that
[SPEAKER_02]: product from the rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, most of the time I use it until
I'm out of that product because I'm not in
[SPEAKER_02]: that facility, but I want to follow that
guideline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure that that product or if you
want to do the research, see if that
[SPEAKER_02]: product is approved in your area for
cannabis application.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have commercial cultivation or the
Colorado approved pesticide list is not
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you Google Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division approved pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: list, you can find it and you can see what
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can apply to the products that
you have to learn when to and when not to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply those products and how to apply
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn about reentry intervals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn about your pesticide, your safety
gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn about all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But please do learn about integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most effective way, in my opinion,
is sprayed applications once or twice a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you do choose to go with the
sprayed pesticide applications as your
[SPEAKER_02]: method of integrated pest management,
I do recommend a rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't spray the same pesticide every time
you spray, because these bugs will develop
[SPEAKER_02]: a resistance to your pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go in there every day, you throw a
right hook by the third or fourth time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just throw up that left block and
they keep their day going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to rotate your pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend two to three different
pesticides and spray one and then spray
[SPEAKER_02]: the other and then spray one and then
spray the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really confuse these bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just mix it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rotate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, another thing you can do is called a
tank mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit advanced,
but do some research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do some reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do this all the time in commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can mix more than one pesticide in
your tank at a time and apply them for
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to apply something that isn't
real sticky, add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: evergreen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make it stickier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now you've got two different
modes of attack for that application in
[SPEAKER_02]: one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow all the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write that stuff down when you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my pesticide application rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about your other option.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other option is, of course,
predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy and release bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into your grow, they will eat the existing
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are bugs that love to eat spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on where you are, the
environment in your grow space,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are several different options.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the lacewing eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy green lacewing eggs and you
can hang these little placards on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and they've got just little
lacewing eggs all over them and they will
[SPEAKER_02]: start to hatch and they look like little
alligators and they'll start climbing
[SPEAKER_02]: around and they will eat all of the other
bugs in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're vicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will go eat all the spider mites,
the spider mite eggs, the thrips,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will eat the shit out of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green lacewings will develop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, they turn into real
big green lacewings and they'll eat
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few other predators I would recommend
are these swarskies, the kookamaras,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hypoaspis myles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then why not throw some rove beetles
in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another one on my mind that
my brain won't say swarskies, kookamaras,
[SPEAKER_02]: hypoaspis myles, californicus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same as some somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rove beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also recommend the we'll say the green
lacewings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another one that goes in the
soil that my brain will not think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think five recommendations is
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is enough to give you a springboard,
a jumping point to start thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, many people in a home grow don't
like the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it's gross to have the idea of
bringing in bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'd be amazed at how many bugs are
already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't even think about that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your first option is so you've cleaned
up the room, clean everything real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would start treating the plants,
introduce an integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_02]: system, rotate three pesticides in once or
twice a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't see any bugs, spray once a
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the first sign of bugs, step that shit
up, spray twice a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to spray stuff because
of whatever and that's up to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't want to spray shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get worried about poisons or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things to read about and educate
yourself on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can try the predator bugs,
which again is a lot of things for people
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I covered this one very well.
