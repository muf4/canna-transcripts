[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 239 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am high as giraffe
pussy today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got done watching a Periscope video
from Uncle Joey Diaz, and every time Joey
[SPEAKER_01]: took a bonk hit, I took a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's just say I got wrecked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo, it's going to be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Uncle Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Joey Diaz, I just bought
tickets to see Uncle Joey at ComedyWorks
[SPEAKER_01]: in February, and I am freaking excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to start the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time we spoke, I was kind of
brash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was bragging about getting to see Bert
Kreischer at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sunday night, I took the lovely and
always beautiful Miss Jenny Beth up to
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver, and we saw Bert Kreischer at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been that excited for a comedy
show in a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bert's been really popular lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been really hyped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not disappoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bert was hilarious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know who I'm talking about,
Bert Kreischer is a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is known as The Machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a bit about The Machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you, as soon as you get done
listening to my podcast, to go to YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: and search Bert Kreischer, The Machine,
and watch that story, and laugh your ass
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw Bert Kreischer at ComedyWorks,
and of course, everybody there treats me
[SPEAKER_01]: like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_01]: They treat me like royalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the royal treatment at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bert came out and did about 40 minutes of
material, and then after 40 minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: he revealed to the crowd that he was
recording his special that night,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he is going to edit down the
recording, the show that he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to edit that down, and that
will be, he's hoping to sell the show to
[SPEAKER_01]: Netflix.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually brought his own film crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: He paid for it all out of his pocket,
and he recorded the entire show out of his
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket with his friends and his own crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody paid for it, and he's going to sell
the special to Netflix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, you guys will be able to
watch this show on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably be like a year before that
happens, honestly, with the way all the
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork and shit happens, and editing
and all that, but eventually, you'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: to see that on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew something was going on because
there was a camera there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a big camera, and there were
microphones and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which isn't odd for ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a regular thing,
but there was a little more production
[SPEAKER_01]: than usual, but usually, if somebody's
doing a special, I saw the taping of Joe
[SPEAKER_01]: Rogan's special at the same event,
at the same venue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Rogan recorded his special,
Rocky Mountain High, at ComedyWorks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I went to that, and it was really
uptight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had everybody taking off their hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't wear shirts with logos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really uptight, kind of intense
experience, and the recording for Bert's
[SPEAKER_01]: show was just, hey, it's just a normal
comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on in and get rowdy, and so that was
really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way better, way smoother,
way less stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were able to enjoy the show more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he recorded a special.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys will be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did about 40 minutes of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he announced that he was doing the
special and recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he looked at a notebook, and he's
like, shit, I gotta do these couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: bits, because he had to get all his
material in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did a couple of bits, and then he
kind of freestyled for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like, then he said, all right,
you guys fucking ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did the machine story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, he felt like he was rushing
through the machine story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laughed so hard, I thought I was gonna
poop myself once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was gonna pee myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: My cheeks were hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: My stomach was hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: After so much laughter, your head will
start to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had laughed my ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time he got to the machine
story, I think he saw the waitresses
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping checks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew it was time to speed it up,
so he was speeding up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorite parts, he would be
telling stories and telling jokes that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard, and then he would just have
random sidebars and just go off on a
[SPEAKER_01]: random sidebar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was telling a story about having to go
to a, and I'm not gonna do the joke any
[SPEAKER_01]: justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to go to a meeting at school for
one of his students, and he woke up and he
[SPEAKER_01]: thought he grabbed two Diet Cokes and put
them in his hoodie pocket and went to the
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in the meeting, and he reached in
his hoodie pocket, and he pulled one out,
[SPEAKER_01]: cracked it open, took a slam of it,
and realized it's a Coors Light,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a Diet Coke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the kind of stories that this
man tells at his comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I got to see a comedian by the name
of Frank Castillo.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know anything about the roast
battles, Frank Castillo was the winner of
[SPEAKER_01]: the roast battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy told some great jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some friends that work at
ComedyWorks, and I'm kind of a regular at
[SPEAKER_01]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I texted my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, hey, I'm here, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ran outside and he goes,
dude, there are several comedians upstairs
[SPEAKER_01]: or downstairs that went to the dispensary
and nobody's got a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just happened to have a pipe in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bunch of high-level comedians
borrowed my pipe and got super stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the show,
Frank Castillo made sure that I got my
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe back.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he saw me, he's like, tall white guy
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This pipe must belong to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made sure that I got my smoking
apparatus back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I owe a huge shout out to Mr. Burt
fucking Kreischer the machine,
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank Castillo, ComedyWorks, and my buddy
Baker.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also an opening act.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name was Elliot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not catch his last name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time an opening act says their name,
they say it like, my name was Elliot and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd never catch their fucking full
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what his last name was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said he looked like a young John
Elway and he took offense to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit was accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another funny part on the show,
Burt Kreischer was talking about trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep his daughters innocent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he believes that once a daughter does
not believe in Santa Claus is about the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time when she starts sucking a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had the lovely always lovely,
always beautiful Miss Jenny Beth on my arm
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting right next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were front row, of course,
at ComedyWorks because we do have the VIP
[SPEAKER_01]: love there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Burt Kreischer looked at Jenny and
said, you ever suck a dick?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she of course nodded her head yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Burt replied with, you believe in
Santa?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she of course nodded her head no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Burt said, case in point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was pretty funny that
Jenny got to be the example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was extra funny that she was
the example of sucking dick and not
[SPEAKER_01]: believing in Santa.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move forward before I get
myself into any trouble with this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about, what else went on
lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a big fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anybody hear about this fight?
[SPEAKER_01]: A boxing match?
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not pay to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't pay to watch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only watched it because of the hype and
I was curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to feel left out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had made predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I predicted, everybody could say they'd
made predictions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it already happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could say, I said that was going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I predicted that if it went further
than four or five rounds that Connor would
[SPEAKER_01]: get tired and put his hands down and get
punched in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to say I was psychic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, that was the, never seen that
dude go for very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen the other dude go for a long
fucking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew he'd wear him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought he might be dangerous if he hit
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: If McGregor would have hit him,
it might've hurt him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't do shit to him though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hope you guys enjoyed the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope somebody won a bunch of fucking
money out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people were gambling on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you were one of the people that
took home a big fat paycheck on that
[SPEAKER_01]: fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was overhyped in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overhyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I didn't pay money to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I didn't go anywhere to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend who broadcasted it on
Periscope Live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dee's Hideaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sharing that with me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's talk about some cannabis
related stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a message on my phone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came to me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I will answer your messages on
just about any platform you send them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would prefer that you reach me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This listener reached out to me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a screenshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it here on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse the coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say enough great things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all the awesome,
clear, comprehensive info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a question about flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, you're off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for enjoying my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening and not having
enough great things to say about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep saying great stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to make the info clear and
comprehensive and I'm glad you find it
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the compliments and I'm happy
to answer your question about flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listened to your flush and cure
episodes multiple times, high and low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm looking too far into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say to run three times fresh water the
size of the pot, which would be nine
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons in my setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question is, should I be running nine
gallons of water total or nine gallons on
[SPEAKER_01]: my bi-weekly water?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he continues with I'm running Fox
Farm Ocean Forest soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk for a second about flushing
and why we want to flush and what flushing
[SPEAKER_01]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point of flushing is to remove excess
nutrients from the buds, from the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: so that when you cut them down,
the plants don't taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't burn like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to move the mobile nutrients
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to make the plants burn much
more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make them taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make them more appealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will smell better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever tried to roll a joint and
you lit a joint and smoked it and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't burn right or the ashes got black
and chunky and became little coals,
[SPEAKER_01]: that herb was probably not properly
flushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been flushed a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a little more heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what flushing will do is you want to
pour enough water through your soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean out the nutrients that are in that
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get rid of all the nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 16 elements in there that you
need to wash out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want that shit left in your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is to rinse the soil enough to
where that is not left in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same time, you need to
give the plant plenty of time to
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolize, which you want it to drink up
that water and metabolize all the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that are left in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll start seeing the leaves turn
golden yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's telling you I'm running out of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll start seeing things start going
purple and silver colors and red and
[SPEAKER_01]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's telling you that all those
nutrients are being sucked out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and the plants are now ready to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now ideally with most soil applications,
you're going to want to give your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 14, maybe even 20 days of flush
time, depending on how heavily you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding them and what is left in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using cocoa or hydroponic
mediums, you can go much less time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes seven days is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 days is usually plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in cocoa, you will really see
the plants flush out quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in cocoa and you start feeding
it just pHed water, pHed it like six four,
[SPEAKER_01]: six five, after three or four or four or
five feedings of that, you will see the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants start reacting and telling you,
hey, I'm out of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because cocoa doesn't hold much nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either it is rock wool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you guys that are using a super soil
or a living soil or no-till, this does not
[SPEAKER_01]: apply to you because the organic stuff
that you're putting in there, the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: only going to take up what it wants and
it's not going to have unnecessary stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and like Subcool says,
you've been flushing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding your plants super soil,
you mixed up a batch of super soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you put the plant in there when it was
little and it has been eating all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients the entire time and it has
converted those nutrients into big healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, big healthy stocks, big fat,
juicy, resinous trichome laden buds that
[SPEAKER_01]: smell like fucking candy and amazingness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those nutrients and amendments
have probably been eaten up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably tell by the way the
plant's acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put too much nutrient in there when
you mixed it up and made the soil too
[SPEAKER_01]: rich, you either burn the plant early or
it's going to take a little too long to
[SPEAKER_01]: eat up all those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to run a little
extra water through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of you guys doing the super soil,
the living soils, the no-till shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no need for you to flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get kind of more to the point of
this listener's question.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to know, since I'm using a three
gallon pot and you recommended that I use
[SPEAKER_01]: three times the amount of water,
do I need to run nine gallons of water
[SPEAKER_01]: through this pot to consider it flushed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like running nine gallons of water
through your three gallon pot is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: flood your plants and drown them and make
them droopy and make them look like shit
[SPEAKER_01]: and really make them angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you're using a plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got air pots or net pots,
that may work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're using a plastic pot,
that's definitely going to drown your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you're going to have a lot of
runoff if you do that, that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice would be to run pH water,
pH balanced about six four, adjusted pH to
[SPEAKER_01]: about six four, run enough of that through
the plant until it's really running out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see water coming out of the
bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe pour it until like half a gallon
comes out or pour and then wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's going to take a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pour a gallon of water in there,
wait a little bit, see how much comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get a half a gallon of water
out of the bottom, pour a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: and wait until you've got about a half a
gallon out of the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be really saturated at that
time and they shouldn't be overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you want to let them dry almost
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them get to where you're like,
oh, they're kind of looking like they need
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them water at that point and soak
them up again until they start running
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do this over the next 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll probably be able to get nine
gallons of water through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do one and a half gallons of water,
that's going to be four or five times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should work out if you're watering
every three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should work out just about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I do remember having the theory
that you should run three times the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of water through your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that we're talking about it,
that seems a little excessive and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to change my mind maybe you just
need double.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't been fertilizing super
heavily and you're taking care of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I think two times the amount of
water, six gallons should do you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll water on the first time,
you're going to do a gallon and a half of
[SPEAKER_01]: water-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second time you'll do another
gallon and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two or that makes three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you do that two more times,
it gives you six gallons in over 14 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be able to get four solid
waterings in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the main thing, you don't have to go
by a certain amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an EC meter or a PPM meter,
get some of the water that comes out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that pot and measure the PPMs of that
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to get it as low as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it, if you're going by,
excuse the throat clearing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going by electrical
conductivity, you want to get it down into
[SPEAKER_01]: the like 1.1, 1.2 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there's not a lot of stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing that keeps ticking in the
back of my head as I'm talking and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: reminding me, say this, if you don't have
some perlite or some sort of aeration in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil, it's easy to drown the plants
with too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got compacted soil that you
didn't add anything to, and I think this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy said he's using Fox Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got decently fluffy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pay attention to how much water is in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to how long it takes them to
dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to drown these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did not put any aeration in with
your cocoa, you need to be more careful
[SPEAKER_01]: about how much water you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in using a lot of perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use more perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots love oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can handle more waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll dry out more evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think you should have some good
perlite in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have some sort of
aeration, be careful because you can drown
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants with too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flush them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about your harvest day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you want to harvest on the 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means on the 1st, you need to get in
there and pour like a gallon and a half of
[SPEAKER_01]: water through each gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it dry up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably take four or five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it dry up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably take four or five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're at like what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 to 15 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're up here on the 14th or 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to cut down your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your leaves are starting to look gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to get a little bit
droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be a little bit crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you know there's no nutrients
left in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you dry it, if you cure it
properly, you put it in a jar,
[SPEAKER_01]: do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole other episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke it, this stuff should leave
a nice white ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't burn your throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be funky at all if you
properly flush it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't flush your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the long answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the short answer is no,
you don't need to run all nine or in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case, we're going to say six gallons of
water through that pot at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is better to stretch it out over a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say your bi-weekly water, so that will
work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stretch it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will thank me for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be well worth your time and
energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why people don't flush more
because if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't cost anything but water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already going to water the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you would put nutrients in there
that start making it cost money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know water does cost something,
but it's next to nothing compared to all
[SPEAKER_01]: the other shit you pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just give them water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to keep them alive for
another 14 days is all you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, here's a little hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduce the lights by an hour or two while
you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just want to speed them up a little
bit, turn the lights down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of 12, 12, go maybe 10,
14 at the end of flower for that last
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see some differences that you're
happy with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you will like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll also save you some money on your
electrical bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I want to address another
topic, just something random.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was somewhere and people were just
talking about random things and I heard
[SPEAKER_01]: this as a topic and I thought I should
talk about that on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was taking dabs and they were
trying to hold their dabs in as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, why do you hold your dabs
so long?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, man, it's just like
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take a big hit, you got to hold
it in so you get everything so you get as
[SPEAKER_01]: high as you can get off that hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, you guys, I don't believe
that to be accurate at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think holding in your smoke,
whether it's a dab, whether it's a joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a bong hit, holding in any
kind of smoke cannot be good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're putting pressure on your lungs,
unnecessary pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your lungs are basically little bags that
fill up and empty with air and they got
[SPEAKER_01]: little sensitive parts in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor, but I know my lungs are
sensitive and I can feel the pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I used to take a bong hit and try to
hold it, you feel your heart start racing
[SPEAKER_01]: and your blood pressure go up and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because your lungs are freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not getting higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are giving yourself an increased risk
of getting chronic obstructive pulmonary
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder, also known as COPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holding smoke is a huge contributing
factor to that disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a condition where you feel like
you're drowning all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't breathe properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't exhale properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fucking scary from what I've
heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who have talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know somebody that's experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quit stressing your lungs
unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people are going to argue and say,
but you get higher if you hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get a head rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your heart races, but you're not getting
more cannabinoids from holding in your
[SPEAKER_01]: hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your lungs are a mucus membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the smoke hits your lungs and
anything that's going to get in goes in
[SPEAKER_01]: and what doesn't coats your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said this on the podcast before.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take a gigantic dab and I'm not
bragging, this is just how I like to do
[SPEAKER_01]: things and I don't have a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just my preferred method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to take about a half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hang out with me, you will testify.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to fucking take a half
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a half gram dab on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that half gram dab gets me
really super medicated for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get medicinal value and I also get
really high from it, which sometimes is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm done with the high,
I still have this layer of oily hash
[SPEAKER_01]: permeating my lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it's a slow release
capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lungs are dissolving and absorbing the
cannabinoids from this hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it melts into my lungs, as it's
available because my lungs can't get it
[SPEAKER_01]: all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it just sits there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't see a need to hold in that
smoke in my lungs and put so much pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: on there when I can just get the smoke in
there and let it work like the filter that
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you blew smoke through any kind
of filter, we'll just say, get a paper
[SPEAKER_01]: towel, fold a paper towel into four pieces
and blow your smoke through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to leave some shit on all four
layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your lungs gather that shit more quickly
than the paper towel does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your lungs are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're part of your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get some shit on that shit
and you will receive it just like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't scrape it out of the paper
towel, but your lungs will kind of clean
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and absorb it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think holding your smoke is a bad
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to fuck up your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's no reason to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're getting it all when you
exhale and that smoke passes your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just went through the filters and
gathered all the shit that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you blow it out,
you're just blowing out all the shit that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to keep in all that bad
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smoking carcinogens, you're smoking
soot, you're smoking green leafy matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not trying to consume green leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to consume cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part you want and probably
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part you're trying to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just get the turps, get the
cannabinoids, get that into your lungs and
[SPEAKER_01]: get the rest of that shit out of there
into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to hold your hits so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to argue with me,
I would love to hear your reasonable
[SPEAKER_01]: argument as an adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just bitch at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got some supporting evidence,
I would love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart and hop in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like I'm wrong on this matter,
please do correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to hear your information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, let's talk about something else that
bothers me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been buying some hash that has the
consistency of maybe cake batter or soft
[SPEAKER_01]: cheesecake and it's delicious hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I offered some to a couple of people
and they said, why do you smoke that
[SPEAKER_01]: unpurged shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unpurged.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, people are under the
impression that waxes and batter and other
[SPEAKER_01]: type consistencies are not purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think that it's got to shatter to be
purged or it's got to be live resin or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not right at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to correct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The waxes, the batters, they are all
purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: People seem to think that it is battery
because there is still solvent in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash I'm smoking is BHO, it's butane
honey oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started making it,
everybody wanted it to shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it shattered, that was the best you can
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: People learned how to heat it and whip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just basically whip it just like you
would whip up cake batter or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to make it fluffy, you put air in
it and that gives it a waxy texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to purge it either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will make the shatter, then they
purge the shatter, then they whip it to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it into other consistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys that are thinking that my
batters and the waxes that I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: from places are not purged, you are wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop spreading that bullshit, please,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't promise you that the stuff you're
getting purged or that you're buying off
[SPEAKER_01]: the street or wherever you're getting it
is purged because I'm not in your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the stuff that's coming from the
dispensaries, if it came from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary, it had to pass a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please stop saying wax isn't purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my main point.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I'm at it, I've got one more thing I
want to rant about and then we will wrap
[SPEAKER_01]: up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with buzzwords.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people talking about the
word organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic shit is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer organic vegetables over
non-organic vegetables if I had the
[SPEAKER_01]: option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to remind you that cyanide is
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because people say this product is
organic or this pesticide is organic
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean it's harmless.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that you can consume it
without any worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some organic compounds are just as
dangerous and just as harmful as manmade
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, if not more dangerous and more
harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is be careful with buzzwords,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can say these plants were treated
with only organic products and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: still be at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottle of pesticide you were
considering purchasing can be labeled
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and it can still be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because something says organic
doesn't mean you can go in your grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: and spray the shit without some sort of
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it says organic, please read the
label a little more carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using organic pesticide,
check out what kind of person or personal
[SPEAKER_01]: protective equipment you need to be
wearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main point here was that we're all
falling for the word organic and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: spending extra money for organic things
and we're trusting things because of that
[SPEAKER_01]: organic stamp, because of that Omri stamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to remind you that you still need
to read the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trust anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trust any labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you're spraying on your
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you're eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't just apply to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This applies to everything with the word
organic on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's my public service
announcement because I care about you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: and I want you to take care of yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to take care of each other and
all together, I want you to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm gonna start wrapping up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's gonna be a short one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a busy week ahead of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in the middle of a busy week.
[SPEAKER_01]: This weekend, I am going to be at Dick's
seeing my favorite band on the damn
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, Phish is in Denver for three
nights, so Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this comes out, I will already
have seen Phish at Dick's Sporting Goods,
[SPEAKER_01]: the big giant soccer field in Denver,
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Monday, when this podcast comes out,
I get to see Mr. Doug Benson at
[SPEAKER_01]: ComedyWorks doing some standup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a busy week coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a busy week last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I saw Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the middle of a whole bunch of
transitions at The Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I do run The Big Grow for Three
Rivers in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a medical and a recreational side
of the store, so if you're looking to shop
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis in the city of Pueblo,
I would highly recommend Three Rivers
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensary on 1714 South Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am their grower, and I take pride in my
work, so go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a long week, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may or may not put out a Thursday
episode this week, so if there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday episode, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because there was a holiday weekend,
and sometimes even Rasta Jeff needs a
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
