[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just came from the dispensary and I have
been smoking a large buffet of delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some GG4 Ambrosia, I have some
Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia, I have some
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropicana Cookies Ambrosia, and I've got
some Stardog Batter that all taste
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my favorite is probably this
Tropicana Lychee Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like grapefruits, it smells like
dish soap, and it smells like smarty
[SPEAKER_00]: candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dabs are tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary
Farms for the buffet of delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, in this episode I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to read a couple of listener emails.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okidokidokidok podcast rolled at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that I was going to read some
listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in this episode goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm living in Prohibition land and I
haven't grown in 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love the podcast and how
informative and entertaining it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the messages that start with
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've had some traumatic
experiences that have given me extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: general anxiety and have given me PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, though, I'm not concerned about
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a five year old son that we see
starting to have many, many problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: being on the spectrum with very high
functioning autism and extreme ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to avoid him being prescribed harsh
narcotics, so I want to get him into CBT.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently been reading about how CBD
and how it could help my son.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I purchased some CBD tinctures legally
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a miracle for my anxiety and
my PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, it turns my son into a
new kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you're purchasing CBD,
you're not exactly sure what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you're getting a CBD,
a legal CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm delighted to hear that it's
helping your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it fixes the kids, that always feels
a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you heal an adult and an adult feels
better, that feels great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you see a little kid just better,
that just makes everybody feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Movies with little kids, those are always
more heart wrenching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with a child just feels better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that your son is able to be
himself and you're able to enjoy your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to build a better
relationship for both of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make both of your lives better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see CBD helping already.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, my son's teachers have
asked me if he is on Adderall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, no, just CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I now need to grow my own medicine for
myself and my son because I can't afford
[SPEAKER_00]: these very expensive CBD oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, what strains would you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like some CBD only and then some
one to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure he means a one to one THC,
one to one CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a very high THC strain for myself
and my fiance, especially since I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: risking it for my son anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously, if you know of any high THC
strains that will help with PTSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you aren't an expert on making
extracts, so I'll get that info elsewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you have some input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow you on all social medias since I
haven't been able to become a patron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for following me on the social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to become a patron for me
to support you and help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, but I will soon and I
look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for bringing this community
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like you are what's making this
industry legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs his message and then it
says, PS been listening since before I
[SPEAKER_00]: started growing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before your dude grows episode,
a true fan of your kindness and voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seriously love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of stuff to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's back up a few steps and talk about a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love and respect the fact that you are
stepping up to produce medicine to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your son and your entire family's life
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you said earlier that you are in
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing we need to weigh here is the
cost of your safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are producing medicine to make
yourself and your son's life better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that worth the risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get caught, you may be removed from
your son's life for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another personal part in this
message I did not read out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine what would happen if you were
removed from your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be in the hands of that other
person you mentioned that I did not read
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be the best outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to weigh those options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I always say grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, your son needs you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to consider your options
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the option to get that
tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equipment is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The processing is going to take a lot of
effort and a lot of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could really screw it up and waste
an entire crop, which means you just
[SPEAKER_00]: risked your freedom and your son's
well-being for a crop that you
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to say you're going to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to put some thought into
your head so you know very clearly what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're risking and you know your options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make that clear for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I probably can't sway you,
but I want you to know that that tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: is available at a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is expensive, but freedom is
priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are not around to help your
son, you are not around to help your son
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really sounds like you've got your
heart set on growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've already purchased
some equipment and you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will talk about some genetics that
would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, if there is tincture
available that is already processed and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy it and it works and it did
what you need done and it is already
[SPEAKER_00]: showing positive results, I may stick to
that if it is illegal to grow in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I would stick with
if it were me for the child's safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I should recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before all of that, I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you made me choose one,
you wouldn't see me do any more cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd just see me focused on that kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needs a good father.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how important it is for us to
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just coming from my fatherly side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is her birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's weighing a little extra
heavy on me today, but that is what I
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to do.
That's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to drug test your kid
and he's got THC in there and now it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to look way ahead in the future
and see options so we can prevent that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of shit from happening, but that
could be the only downfall to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a phenohunt, you find that
perfectly custom tailored phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: works for your child, then it's got THC in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works, I hope that is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it works beautifully, but I don't
want any trouble to come from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a lab test, you don't know exactly
what you are giving your kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that you grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what it's in it, but we don't know
the finished cannabinoid or terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without a qualified lab, I don't know
how you would determine how much THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is in your product, but I can make
recommendations on seeds that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: well known to be very high in CBD and very
low in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, the strain I am about to
recommend is grown in many hemp fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, finished products are allowed
to have 0.3% THC, which is very little
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a product tests any higher than 0.3%
THC, it is either considered cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: if it is supposed to be a hemp plant,
it is then destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a hemp farmer produces too much hemp
that tests what we call hot, if it tests
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than 0.3% THC, he can face legal
ramifications in the state of Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: just by growing a plant that accidentally
tested too high for a certain cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people in Colorado are very picky about
the plants that they are planting in their
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very popular CBD varietal that has been
going around Colorado is known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do a Google search,
you should be able to find the cherry wine
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and you should be able to get your
hands on them very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a high CBD hemp variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I need to suggest if you choose
to grow the cherry wine is make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it down a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes too late, it will develop some
THC and it will become hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most often times a little bit of THC will
help with the effects of the CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also we need to pay attention to how
we are medicating your son and we may need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be careful for legal reasons like we
mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do let the cherry wine go too
long and it develops THC, it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful, but I would recommend cutting it
down early the first few times and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: it works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've found a phenotype that you
really like, then start playing with that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow multiple clones of the same phenotype
in the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe grow four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much space you'll have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say grow four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe cut one down a week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe cut one down right on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut one down a week late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got another one that you
can cut down whenever you feel like it
[SPEAKER_00]: just because we picked four for some
stupid reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe do some experiments and find out
what cannabinoid profile you get by
[SPEAKER_00]: letting them grow a little sooner,
a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the hemp variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the cherry wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry wine has become really popular in
Colorado and across the entire United
[SPEAKER_00]: States since the farm bill allowed us to
grow more hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cherry wine is really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been bred to many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can recommend if you can't
find cherry wine seeds by itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recommend the cherry Torino from
llama bean seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should find some very CBD dominant
phenotypes in the cherry Torino as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk more about things
that do have the potential to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one ratio phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when you're growing from seed,
you're going to see phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have different cannabinoid
profiles, different terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly completely different growth
shapes and structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that is the fun and the
beauty of growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to pick the phenotype that works
perfectly for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you get to pick the
phenotype that works perfectly for your
[SPEAKER_00]: son.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some ones to one ratio
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: A strain that I see commonly testing with
one-to-one ratios is something called
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennywise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennywise should put out some phenotypes
that will give you a one-to-one CBD to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of course will lean heavier to the
CBD side and some will lean heavier to the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, but you will find that one-to-one
ratio phenotype in there if you run a few
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one I can suggest is the
Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that Harlequin is available
in seeds by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be available in feminized seeds
somewhere by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it has been crossed to many other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find many CBD heavy and
one-to-one type phenotypes in many
[SPEAKER_00]: Harlequin crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another strain I should mention that is
known for making high CBD and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one ratio phenotypes is a plant
known as ACDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some breeding done to ACDC and
everything that comes out seems to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out CBD rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can find seeds of ACDC or a
cross of ACDC, you should find some
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially CBD rich and possibly
one-to-one type phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is going to be phenotype
dependent and you don't have a lab to test
[SPEAKER_00]: for THC and CBD, so you're going to have
to find a phenotype that works for your
[SPEAKER_00]: son or yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you really want a better
opportunity to get a true one-to-one
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, something you could do would be to
grow something like the Cherry Wine or
[SPEAKER_00]: another CBD rich variety like the Wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow some of that and then you
could extract that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could grow something that is high
in THC like we're going to talk about in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a moment and you could extract that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make your tincture out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a batch of high THC
tincture for yourself and for your fiance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got a vat of high CBD
tincture for your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could mix them at will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a 50-50 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a one-to-three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a 20-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make whatever kind of blend you
wanted out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could customize your cannabinoid
ratios that would work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, without lab testing, you're going
to have to experiment on yourself and see
[SPEAKER_00]: which plant works best for you,
see which ratios and which mixes work best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that is part of the fun of
medicating with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your condition is a little more serious
than some people's, so it's a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: critical that we get it correct and also
we're working with a small person here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we really need to make sure to get the
ratio dialed in so we don't create any
[SPEAKER_00]: discomfort that may scare the child away
from using it as medicine again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really want to work on getting it
right, but just a little trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take too long to get everything
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about some THC-rich
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you said strains that work well for
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a traumatic brain injury that
comes with a little bit of weird PTSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I have experience in that department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed through myself and talking
with other people that there are a few
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that really do help with things
like PTSD, so let's jump right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites, and maybe just
because I bred it and it is named after
[SPEAKER_00]: me, but one of my favorites that works for
my brain injury and my PTSD is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: strain called lemon jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffrey is a female lemon skunk
pollinated by a reversed golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that is a feminized seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffrey seems to work very well for
anxiety and PTSD type of situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, so I described that my brain
injury kind of makes it feel like my
[SPEAKER_00]: record skips a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my brain will be going just fine,
but then sometimes it'll just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just, it'll just, and then it'll
keep going right after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as it comes back around to that
part of the record, so it'll just skip a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else really notices it but me,
but I feel like if I smoke enough lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: jeffrey or a couple of the other strains
that we're gonna talk about, that little
[SPEAKER_00]: skip on my record just gets wiped right
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like record cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just polish up my CD, cleans up my
record, cleans my hard drive or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: puts all the files back in the correct
drawer so that my brain can access them
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like strains that have limonene
really work well for my brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: for my PTSD, for my traumatic brain
injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lemon jeffrey works beautifully for the
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another strain I can recommend for anxiety
and PTSD is jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something in the jilly bean that
just puts a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the PTSD kind of chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of bad thoughts, bad vibes,
bad moods, it all just kind of just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad vibes are washed away when you
smoke the lemon jeffrey and the jilly
[SPEAKER_00]: bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of, it just makes you feel
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a better mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's the high from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's the specific
cannabinoids in either one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the limonene and the lemon jeffrey
really has something to do with it just
[SPEAKER_00]: from as much attention as I've paid to
that limonene turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that one helps my brain a lot,
but the jilly bean kind of does the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't last as long, but it'll get me
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another strain that works really well
for the PTSD and anxiety type of stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: a strain called clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine smells a lot like jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine is very similar to the lemon
jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine has lemon skunk in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffrey also has lemon skunk in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me think there's something
about that lemon skunk turp or that lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk strain that is doing something good
for the PTSD, for the anxiety type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just thought of one more that I
should mention that fits right into this
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say the name of the strain,
you're going to go, oh yeah, that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one that really works well for PTSD
and anxiety and social anxiety sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is a little strain called tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people have heard of tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting kind of popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have heard of that one a
couple of times, but that orange citrusy
[SPEAKER_00]: turp seems to really do something really
nice for the traumatic brain injury PTSD
[SPEAKER_00]: type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those strains will be high in THC,
but they're not going to be the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be in the high 20s if grown
properly, the mid to high 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may hit 30, that lemon
jeffrey has hit 30 before, but not all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are going to be super high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's more about the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need those turps to get what
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the THC, if it were fireworks,
the THC tells you how high the firework is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the turps are kind of what colors the
firework is going to put off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the turps decide the display.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC decides how high it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the terpenes are going to have
a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't focus too much on that THC number.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is definitely important, but the turps
are what we need if we're aiming for a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific condition and you asked for
something for the PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, without lab testing,
we don't know exactly what type of ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the cherry wine will be rich
in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the few I mentioned will have
the opportunity and the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce high CBD phenotypes and also
one-to-one ratios, also other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: specific ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're going to get,
but they do have the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a lab test, you'll find something
in there that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a kind of a placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave you a bunch of lab numbers,
you would believe that that one with that
[SPEAKER_00]: good number works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without those numbers, the one that works
will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rely on your body, rely on what you
observe in your son, and you will know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly which plant to keep using.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so those are a bunch of
different options for strains that you
[SPEAKER_00]: asked information on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got something CBD, something
one-to-one, something THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of that information, I hope you
have made a decision on if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or if you want to stick to getting
those tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to grow a good amount
to produce enough tincture to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire family medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm the only podcast online right
now without a CBD tincture sponsorship or
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of CBD tincture advertising,
but there are many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many options available for
quality CBD tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you go at the reputable company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the place you are shopping has become
too expensive, shop around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, don't be fooled by gimmicky
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for snake oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read a lot of reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shop around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to buy a product,
type in the name of that product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: type in customer reviews and go read a lot
of reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish out the bullshit reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those reviews are going to be
fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were left by the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to find that shit and then read
the reviews and see what you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to get it from that one
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many options available,
but I hope you're able to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be able to grow and
produce a quality product, but it is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know there are options
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend out there in
Prohibitionland, I want to thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: this great email.
