from your heart podcast.

joined me once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking some time out of the
evening, setting up the camera,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the mic going and doing a podcast
with me.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Mike, what are you smoking on today,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I've got some apothecary as per
usual.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been shopping in a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time you went, you really went
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't need to shop for a few days,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Settle the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave some for the other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lemon G is what I've hit most
recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a little runny as per usual,
but it's so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always runny, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to chase it like it can run all
it wants to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get like a spoon type dabber
and get it on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the high, when I smoke it,
I'm just talking over your dab now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love it because it makes me like
full fucking psychedelic goofball mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a good 20 or 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a little giggly right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a Ramblecast, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said a moment ago that if you take
another dab, it should be indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, let's record then
because that means they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: chatty and talkative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't mean to interrupt you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coughing in your face and talking over you
when I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about your dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that lemon G, but today I am
dabbing a crescendo live batter from green
[SPEAKER_02]: dot labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about the crescendo on a
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the chem D I 95 and Mandarin
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to hold the jar just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's added the way that it's
printed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't read it looking at it straight
on it blends in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go to an angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the font sticks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I looked like a,
like grandma trying to adjust my bifocals
[SPEAKER_02]: over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just read this label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, on the package, it says it is the
flavor should taste like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavy chem gas and cookie dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first opened the jar, it's cookie
dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a vanilla cookie dough, chocolate
chip cookie dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like those toll house cookies that
mama used to make smell real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when you hit it, that's when the
gassy chem comes in, or for me at least
[SPEAKER_02]: the gas and the chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after you exhale, it's just that
chem on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like chem and sweetness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show the batter to the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, sadness.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one dab left in there,
except going at it, but that's what we got
[SPEAKER_02]: left.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last dab in this jar of the crescendo
live batter from our friends at green dot
[SPEAKER_02]: labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets me nice and stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice Indica punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It like makes me mellow, but it also gets
me talking to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really nice product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will see when I tip this jar,
how the font disappears.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they do that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that's an effect that
happened on accident, but digging this
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to hit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That very last dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, let's do the part of the show where
we give shout outs to the friends who
[SPEAKER_02]: support us on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I roll up big fat digital joints
or pack up digital bong loads or scoop up
[SPEAKER_02]: some digital dabs and I send them out
individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That eats up so much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say big dab to all of
our friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start off with a big shout out to my
buddy, Nick dude out there in Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a big shout out to my buddy,
Papa Roni.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have an email coming up from our
buddy, Papa Roni.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to send a giant shout out to
my buddy, the THC activator and his buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: G Farms 401.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for teaming up, throwing down on
the Patreon and getting us moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got any questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to send a giant grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my buddy, Dan, the indoor
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always showing us love, always being a
good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also got a giant shout out for my
friend, Lefty's Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always got a giant shout out for
learning and burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning and burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get any better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always be learning, always be burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last, but certainly not least,
I've got a giant shout out for my friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: Callie Canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks, big shout out, big fat dab for
everybody who supports the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show and you're not already doing so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can learn how to do so by visiting www
.patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did include a link in the show notes
to make it easy for my stoned friends and
[SPEAKER_02]: also Mike, would you like to remind them
about your Patreon campaign?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check me out at patreon slash
white Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you turn up your mic just a little
tiny bit, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll still get you dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just a little bit quiet tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're talking quiet to
keep the kids mellow, but we got to get
[SPEAKER_02]: you a little hotter or my mic is booming.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big knob, just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't fuck anything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you're still on the side of the
mic and I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That better?
[SPEAKER_02]: That now you're keeping up with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we're still getting it dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining us for another Zoom
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is learning how to be a sound
engineer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's getting fucking good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just learned how to turn himself up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we need to do in this part of
the show, Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about your Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've told them what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything good, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you want to cover before we get
to the email portion of the podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's grand, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to dwell too much on the
COVID-19 situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are recording at the end of April.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: 29th, the very end of April.
[SPEAKER_02]: April 29th, 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020, just in case you're listening,
way in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a month and a few days into the
quarantine situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't shaved in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is on a no shave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're wondering, I'm growing the
world's worst pandemic beard viewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It qualifies, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said in a previous episode, you look
like the guy where they tried to put the
[SPEAKER_02]: magnet beard on him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm growing it in solidarity with my
brother, whose wife convinced him to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dig of the day was my beard is really,
his beard is shitty, but my beard is way
[SPEAKER_03]: worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he feels a lot better about his.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your son's beard is almost as thick as
yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It finally got soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to shave it off today so that
the kids have relented and that you have
[SPEAKER_03]: to shave to like, well, it doesn't hurt
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long until the wife overrides this
solidarity move?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be much longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been locked down so long,
we're talking about beards and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't been, we're not supposed to
leave our houses unless we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: essential business, which includes
dispensaries and grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it really.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we really need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other crazy thing that just happened
yesterday or the day before, the Pentagon
[SPEAKER_03]: released UFO footage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys haven't seen it,
go check it out and then ask yourself why
[SPEAKER_03]: it got released now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that there is UFO footage,
but I have not watched the actual UFO
[SPEAKER_02]: footage because I don't know, I'm so
skeptical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it had to be fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize it was actually the
Pentagon that released that when I saw it
[SPEAKER_02]: because anybody can make a UFO video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the gear right here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a post about it and I was like,
oh, what's the onion up to now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I clicked on it and I was like,
NBC, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pentagon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there was alien footage or UFO
footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say alien.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a way different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was UFO footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hinted that it may be released with a
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just trying to distract us
and do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta quit saying they.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know their email address,
they aren't real people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be the conductor that puts
this motherfucking train back.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an email show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should probably get to an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we said in the beginning that you
took a couple too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, we're going to ramble for
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we are going to read a
couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's segue into that portion of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grab an email off of the
stack of emails over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like to send me an email,
my email address is grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_02]: at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love reading listener emails on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lets me know I'm helping at least one
person, at least this person right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get some help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if they've got the question,
more people probably do as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's quit rambling and focus in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Rasta Jeff, I've got a question for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be a show subject to touch on if you
feel the need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously it qualifies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says my pH pens are not near the top of
the line, but I believe when I mix in
[SPEAKER_02]: MycoChum or anything that's sort of thick,
it jacks my pens up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I let them sit in distilled water
overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should not sit in distilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you read the instructions on your pH
meter, it says not to set it in distilled
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want some type of water with minerals
and nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way it doesn't kill the probe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand exactly how that works,
but you want something in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually sell a solution,
which they recommend you leave your meters
[SPEAKER_02]: in overnight or over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the kind with the cap,
you just put enough in the cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You close the cap up and it stays in there
and keeps the node, the probe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps it moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't keep it in distilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they get used daily, but I seem to
never get them calibrated correctly after
[SPEAKER_02]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because you have left them in the
wrong water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're messing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any tips that could make my
life easier on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, you said that they mess up when
you mix in microchum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pull it right out of the
microchum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while that shit is still drippy,
go into a container of clean water and
[SPEAKER_02]: shake the shit out of it and make sure
you've got it clean and clean it once a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're calibrating it, also clean the
shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it is super clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we already touched on the main
issue here, not storing it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being stored in distilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the manufacturer packages will say
not to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is probably what's fucking you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your life easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the fucking book, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: RTFM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the fucking manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just being a smart ass, but that probably
would have saved you in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have taught you a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy at the grow store should have
given you a hint.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the grow store, they like to tell you
if it dries, it dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have hinted that at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have, but he didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't tell you that till you're
buying your third one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want you to keep coming back and
getting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on to say, I also feel that these
pins are the most important tool in a grow
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have any advice on a good brand
that's not going to break me that is also
[SPEAKER_02]: dependable and can hold up for a while
without having to calibrate constantly?
[SPEAKER_02]: The calibrate constantly thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like calibrating my gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to calibrate it at least once a
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I know it's some peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like giving people a driving test.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no one that they could still
drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like giving old people a vision test
before you let them drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you still see?
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we can't let you on the road and
they can still see who put you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that fucking pH meter qualified?
[SPEAKER_02]: I need it to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my situation, I'm in charge of
multimillion dollar facilities sometimes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't mess up the pH for millions of
dollars a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need quality gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I calibrate it once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is watching me do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is watching me teach the crew how to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike has probably stood there and waited
for me to calibrate pins before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've helped people throw away crops killed
by improperly calibrated gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've helped them trash and replant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then this person asks for quality gear
that I can recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not paid by anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like any time I recommend a
brand, I get 12 emails telling me that I
[SPEAKER_02]: suck for recommending a certain brand and
that I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you what I buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you what I use and what
works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just from experience and
financial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fits the budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the Bluelab 3-in-1 combo meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tells me my EC, my pH, and my
temperature of my solution with two
[SPEAKER_02]: different probes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stick them in there and I get three
different readings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a large reservoir,
you can screw it to the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes batteries.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be able to get it off the
wall occasionally to put the batteries in
[SPEAKER_02]: and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The batteries go in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put batteries in it, screw it to the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can drop those probes right in
your reservoir and they'll just be in the
[SPEAKER_02]: reservoir at all times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you push the button, it'll show you
your pH is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your temperature is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your PPMs or EC is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll show you right on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the Bluelab 3-in-1 combo
meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little pricey, but you only have to
buy it once if you take care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was trying not to cough into the
mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the coughs from the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking cannabis podcast goes,
but I recommend that 3-in-1 combo meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't get the 3-in-1, just get the
Bluelab pH meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I also like to test the EC or the
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I like to test the EC or the
PPMs of the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I test the water before I put nutrients in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll hold that PPM or the PM meter in
there and I'll pour in nutrients and stir
[SPEAKER_02]: it and see what it goes up with the first
one and see what it goes up to the second
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pay attention to the total PPMs or EC
of my solution before I water it to my
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when it runs off, I'll get enough of
that solution and measure that solution as
[SPEAKER_02]: well and mark that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm marking down the pH and the EC of the
solutions going in and out of my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to test the water a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those small variables will make huge
differences in your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something to think about and we're
going to work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question really helps us address
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me make sure I've got the right email
up because that just made me think how
[SPEAKER_02]: great the next email would be for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure I got it up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I'm right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is more to this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, these pens are cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recommend a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, like always, thank you for
sharing your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, your mix episodes have changed my
style for the better and answered a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: questions, which I have wondered about,
signed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to read their name because
it doesn't say if I can or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're huge supporters of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been around for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're friends and family now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that pen calibrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't show a little check mark,
when you calibrate it, it's time to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: new fucking meter, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have let that thing die.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have let it dry and it is rest in
peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be able to send it back to Blue
Lab so they can recycle it, make another
[SPEAKER_02]: meter out of it so you don't have to put
it in the landfill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe contact them for that or whatever
company it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a Blue Lab because you said it's
a piece of junk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it's one of those yellow ones and
we're not going to say the name of that
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike knows what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: He watched all the new growers get those
little yellow ones at the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just die, die, die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't like the pH, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like the pH meter I
recommended, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recommend a good one to me and I'll do
research and I'll see if it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I like it, then maybe we will also
recommend that to our friends on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you've got a pH pen you want
somebody to test, feel free to send us
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I said the next email would involve
that, but I do have another one that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: up first because we're going to do it this
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes from, again, it just says
cheers my friend and they signed it with
[SPEAKER_02]: an emoji.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it came up as just a square when I
printed it, probably a thumbs up,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it wasn't a middle finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I am a cannabis grower and a
cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also grow for medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know a lot about this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was searching the podcast app on my
phone for cannabis growers and I found a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch of podcasts on the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there are a plethora of cannabis
related podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is that I could not find
one podcast that would catch my attention
[SPEAKER_02]: for me to stick around long enough,
except your show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned so much more from you in just
one day of listening than the whole month
[SPEAKER_02]: of listening to another podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really try to be direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of dwell on one topic too long
sometimes, but I try to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody can absorb the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike learns way differently than I do,
differently than Matt does, differently
[SPEAKER_02]: than you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all have our own way of learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to put all those options out there
on the table so you can see what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching and I can paint the picture with
different colors and make sure you get it
[SPEAKER_02]: from different angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you appreciate the show and I'm
glad I keep your attention because I've
[SPEAKER_02]: got ADD and I know what it's like having a
hard time getting attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I taught you a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more to it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, to be honest at first,
I thought you were a talking robot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Rasta Jeff, the robot,
the grow drone.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but really just a fucking charismatic
dude that has a passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it says, the more I listen,
I realize that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says your podcast is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very informative and I just wanted to
say congratulations and keep up the good
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your grow room safety episode was on
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see more info on safety in
the grow pertaining to home growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't intending to cover that,
but I wanted to get our friend's message
[SPEAKER_02]: in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been waiting for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of quick things to think about
home safety when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got kids around, if you've got
other people around, a lock on the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: door is the first step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then right outside of that door,
a fire extinguisher is the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then inside of that grow room,
a smoke detector.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, if you have a fire from a light,
a fan, anything in there, it goes beep
[SPEAKER_02]: beep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You run, you grab fire extinguisher,
you kick open door and you go spray,
[SPEAKER_02]: spray, spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've saved the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are probably the first three
things I would think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would follow it up with a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can put some cameras in there on
the perimeter on the inside, cameras are
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I like a PL minder or some sort of a
sensor unit that lets me know what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several available.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know I work with PL grow.systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use coupon code GFYH25 and save a few
bucks if you get a PL minder unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like something that lets me know
what's going on in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can open up my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two or three spaces that are
registered to PL grow systems and I can
[SPEAKER_02]: see what's happening in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I know the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_02]: With those monitors, I can basically tell
if somebody has opened the door or not
[SPEAKER_02]: within certain timeframes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you open the door,
the temperature and the humidity spike,
[SPEAKER_02]: things change in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are ups and downs when you open the
door and I can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how long you were in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then also if I think you were in there,
I can look at the camera and I can do the
[SPEAKER_02]: footage with the fucking PL minder unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see, look, fucker, you left the door
open from fucking three to five and here's
[SPEAKER_02]: how much CO2 we wasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that kind of stuff on the
monitor and the minder unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are great tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use them as security features.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also help you with the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a door lock is number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first thing when it comes to
safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep motherfuckers out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way if something goes wrong,
we know something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then some sort of excuse why your house
smells like skunks all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably another good security
measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cameras are always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Professional power upgrades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Professional power upgrades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're an electrician, but don't
let me and Mike or Mike and I come wire up
[SPEAKER_02]: your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't overload your breakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always something to think about and
don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another important grow room safety
tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really plan a good grow room
safety episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I will make a note on this page to
do a better episode on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do a safety episode two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember- This is just off the
cuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did play the safety dance at the end of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty good basic list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure to get our
friends email on the show and give them a
[SPEAKER_02]: shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember that episode now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the safety dance at the end of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it as soon as I wrote safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, we played safety dance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making sure we covered all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I'm able to get another safety
episode out for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope a couple of quick tips help our
listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the great emails coming, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, I feel like we're going really fast
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just staying on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staying on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a couple of dabs, so I'm glad I'm
staying on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to jump right into the next
message or you got anything fancy to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your throat's not on point tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing podcasts and dabbing for
the past fucking, since 420, I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on this microphone, so my throat
will live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will catch on or it won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just have a throaty otomy pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That last dab got me right in the nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lemon cheese playing with my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been a great podcast guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not messing up anything too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes from our friend,
Thor, and Thor says, what's up,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_02]: If this makes it to the show, feel free to
give me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Thor from Prohibition Land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big up, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Viking handshake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, anyways, man, I've been
struggling with the water in my area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I started growing, I've been taking
empty jugs of water to those glacier water
[SPEAKER_02]: vending machines at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a major pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you're also going to get noticed
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking of buying my own RO filter,
but everyone says they're a big pain in
[SPEAKER_02]: the ass as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, but they have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology has advanced a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I'm kind of at a loss here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want good water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to hurt my ladies,
and I don't mind buying a good filter if I
[SPEAKER_02]: knew what exactly to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you said in Colorado, you have good
water, but here in Texas, I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got that Texas tea going on,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of filters would you recommend
to get the best results for my ladies?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned so much from listening to
your show, and I appreciate all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a fat dab and give moms a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thor brings up a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is not the same in all
municipalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has got some chunky water.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to make sure that water is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's considering RO, but we do have to
keep in mind, RO is quite wasteful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much of the water we run through that
machine, it is waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes right down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is gray water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it to wash the car and scrub
the floors, but you can't drink it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't want to wash anything like
yourself with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology has come a long way with RO
filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem you run into there is
balancing pH and adjusting and buffering
[SPEAKER_02]: the water becomes more challenging when
you don't have any solution in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go directly to RO unless your
water is completely nasty and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: running in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would recommend is a big boy or a
small boy filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that is the type of filter
they use in an RV, and I think that those
[SPEAKER_02]: are good filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will work well to clean out
whatever's in your municipal water to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it safe for your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to nerd out about it,
you can get a test and see what is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: water and then see how much of that you
want to remove, and you can get specific
[SPEAKER_02]: filtration for that water, but that's
going to get expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water test won't be expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably ask the city what they
put in it, but from the city down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: main pipe, to the other pipe, to the
branch off pipe, to the neighborhood ... I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know what the tubes are called,
the real names for where the water runs,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every pipe is going to have some sort of
sediment, some sort of buildup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get some other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time it goes from the plant out to
your sink, to your hose, it's got other
[SPEAKER_02]: shit in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may want to check on a water test.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really interested, see what's in
there and then see exactly what filtration
[SPEAKER_02]: is required to move those elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, you may want to go RO if
it's something real crazy, but I really
[SPEAKER_02]: think that a big boy or a small boy
filter, that's what I use in a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like water testing in Texas is
pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should be easy in most places.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I got there is get your water
tested and figure out exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get out of it, and then you'll
know how to attack it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some pretty gnarly water
filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nasty goes in, good comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, but then you have to think about how
much waste and how much the filters cost
[SPEAKER_02]: and how often you need to change those
filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good start would be to check your pH and
your PPMs with your new meters that we
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended to the last listener and then
see what you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got crazy PPMs in there,
you may want to take some shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the plants are acting like they're not
happy, you may want to remove some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a lot of chloramine in things,
the big boy and the RO, the big boy and
[SPEAKER_02]: the small boy aren't going to take out
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to have to use RO to
get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would recommend is research
what's in there and then decide what you
[SPEAKER_02]: need based on what's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reverse osmosis, and it's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get an RO set up for the home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that you have a float so that
you don't overflow your reservoir,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just go ahead and get a big boy or a
small boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You turn on that water and it just runs
all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fill up your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you get any of the float so it
turns off when it's full.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole other step, but do the
research, find out what's in the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: then get the appropriate filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of a vague answer,
I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big boy, small boy, and RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the three recommendations I
would make.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to get critical,
see what's in that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Thor, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all of the support,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've been around for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see your name pop up in the
email box.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got any more questions,
please reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have another email in this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to keep running right
through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike has got the giggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is three, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Email number three for this episode goes a
lot like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually says, feel free to shout
out my name on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am Davy Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So find our friend Davy Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No space, just Davy with two B's and
Hayes, Davy Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The message says, hi Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy listening to your podcast
and I felt I should contribute to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I signed up for the four dollar and 20
cent month, a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, that was hard for my brain to read
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 420 a month plan really made that
slash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it says, I feel I get more than
that value regarding grow tips and just
[SPEAKER_02]: the pure entertainment value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you're getting your money's
worth for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that money is scarce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it says, I live in a unfriendly
prohibition state and I've been growing
[SPEAKER_02]: and smoking cannabis for almost 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of us due to be a cannabis
warrior, a long time warrior, longer than
[SPEAKER_02]: us, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says your podcast and the Dude Grow
Show are my links to the outside legal
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool to think that people
are living vicariously through you and
[SPEAKER_02]: myself and the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frightening and awesome all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado showing people how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to enjoy these beautiful
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you are enjoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you're listening to my friends at
the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, big shout out to the Dude and Scotty
and Guru and JR and Maestro and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always forget somebody when I talk about
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm due for a visit to the bakery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take Mike up there also and go
see my friends at the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on to say, I hope to make it to
Denver next spring to attend the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's going to be summer or fall.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will be sure to say hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The DGC Cup will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the venue booked.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people can you get a Zoom
meeting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to be patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who wants to be smoking with everybody
right now anyway?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up and it says, I almost
forgot to mention, I just bought a pack of
[SPEAKER_02]: orangegasm from Seeds Here Now and I look
forward to popping these beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this means that you have got time to
grow some orangegasm and bring it to us
[SPEAKER_02]: when we hang out at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, pictures or it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see that orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Dabby Hayes, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to shaking your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to taking a fat dab with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever all this COVID stuff is over,
we're going to meet up at the Dude Grow
[SPEAKER_02]: Show up there in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's nodding his head like I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bro, you'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our footy Dabby Hayes will be there
and we're going to dab the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Mike, we're on a roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read one more email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just dive right into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going for four people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just jump right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, hello, you can call me Tonto as
my friends do if you use this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, my name is blank from Alberta,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put his real name in there also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to call him.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Tonto from Alberta,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to all of the hard work and audio
material you have put out at zero cost to
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone, which has given me the
confidence and knowledge to switch from
[SPEAKER_02]: legal productions to at home medical
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great opening line.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the hard work and audio material
and video material at this point at zero
[SPEAKER_02]: cost to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not require any payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is free, free, free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Ben Harper said, free freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm honored that I gave you knowledge
and courage to switch from working with a
[SPEAKER_02]: legal company to your own home medical
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on to say, I recently received my
license from health Canada to legally grow
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, no words or amount of money can
show my gratitude for sharing so much
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge with the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your podcast is my number one way to
consume and absorb information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I close my eyes, I imagine that I can
see my grow in Canada because this person
[SPEAKER_02]: has listened so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a trellis stout.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got three gallon pots under a
thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just doing my shit probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's beautiful to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the bottom of my heart,
thank you for providing a fantastic
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation of knowledge for me to build
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love knowing that people are having
success with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love knowing they're having success with
my advice, with my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why this show exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so rewarding to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you see them grow the seeds I
breathe and listen to the show and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they smoke it and they feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I return that feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I express that gratitude as well,
because without the listeners and without
[SPEAKER_02]: these types of emails, I wouldn't know I'm
doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: High five, fist bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect that and appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also goes on to say, I hope that you
and yours are doing well and safe here in
[SPEAKER_02]: this time of uncertainty in our world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people have been and will
continue to be hit very hard by COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very fortunate to be in my current
situation, which has left me better off
[SPEAKER_02]: than most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big respect to that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to show my thanks and support,
I have increased my Patreon subscription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although small, it still helps,
I am sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything helps right now, especially
like you said, in this time of COVID,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very generous of anybody to help
anybody else out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm going to shamelessly pitch
Mike's Patreon, patreon.com forward slash
[SPEAKER_02]: white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a new Patreon, so check him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, there we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a couple of questions I was
hoping you could answer for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I covered my face from the camera when I
do this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to be camera conscious.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to get a lapel mic and do
this differently so the mic's not right
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it says, I've searched the internet
for answers already, but the information
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't trust, or there was no source for
the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you are very smart for not trusting
some information that you read on the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet because people can type whatever
they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I just went and typed, hey,
it would be good for you to send Ross to
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff $4 every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's good karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just type that on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to be careful because people
could type anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you say, you mentioned it in one of
your episodes that you would remove any
[SPEAKER_02]: large fan leaves with a purple stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious as to why, since I first heard
it, I've been doing a bit more defoliation
[SPEAKER_02]: every grow as I get more confident.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you explain to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when they ask another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question to hear is why do we
remove the leaves with purple pedial?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've talked about when you're
defoliating any leaf with a purple pedial
[SPEAKER_02]: as a perfect candidate to remove from the
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I train the guys and gals in
commercial cultivation environments
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is a very easy identifier of
what goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's purple, it can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys and girls can see purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 year old stoners can see purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really identifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really easy to compare it to a nice
bright green pedial or green leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's purple, that means it's probably
big enough to be taken off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, the purple leaves are the
bigger leaves, the big fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those pedials are sticking off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can see that it's purple,
it's probably long enough for your eye to
[SPEAKER_02]: visually notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tells me you can take it out of the
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purple pedial leaves are the first
ones to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also the older leaves,
so they're probably bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also the ones that are going to be
nutrient deficient first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those bigger leaves are where the bugs are
going to hide first.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're blocking the shadows below so the
light can't get down or they're blocking
[SPEAKER_02]: the light so you got shadows down below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're the biggest leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also running out of nutrients is
why they're changing color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take those out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a real easy indicator to teach
the guys and gals in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get all the purple pedials and clean
them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they get real good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they can just take a little bit more
after that or take just another layer
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you just get them trained and they
can do it visually after a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start understanding what needs to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying that you're becoming more
comfortable with defoliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep doing it and you will see overdo it
on one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purposely overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what the limit is because you'll be
surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants respond very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants, they get kind of pissy with
you if you defoliate too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experiment with that and dial it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why I say take the purples because
those are the bigger, older leaves and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're beginning to become nutrient
deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a second part, maybe a third part
coming up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, could you explain or point me to
the podcast about reusing soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be more eco-friendly and save a
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to reuse my soil if there are
not too many cons in doing so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not the expert in soil recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it in a very archaic manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I do it in a very ...
There's no fanciness to what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to identify the fact that there is
soil and soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil is alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil's got microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably got some worms and shit
going on in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am using a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure which you are using,
but there is a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil is alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living soil will eat all of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a plant out and leave that
soil there, the root ball in there and all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the microbes and enzymes and things
happening in that soil will decompose and
[SPEAKER_02]: eat that root ball and turn that into fuel
for the next plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing it that way,
that's kind of a no-till environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could cut out the main plant,
cut out the main stock, put a new plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and backfill it with compost or
fresh soil cut with compost right on top
[SPEAKER_02]: of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not a no-till guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some details will be off here,
but you can basically pull out the root
[SPEAKER_02]: ball, put a new plant in there,
backfill with some compost or some cut
[SPEAKER_02]: compost, fill that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a new cover crop over it and continue
to grow with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cover crop will fall in, provide
nutrients to that soil base.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could put some worms in there and keep
all that shit alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a living soil, no-till environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is much easier to recycle that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even take it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull a plant out, you put a plant in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to flush it because you're
always adding organic amendments or
[SPEAKER_02]: organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chelated or buffered products
being force-fed to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a totally different environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll know if you've got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been feeding it microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been giving it worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been feeding it cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you went to the store and you got some
shit mixed with perlite and it's mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: peat and you got other microbes and just
shit like that and it was on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is probably soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a much different beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not alive, so you've got to flush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to clean it out if you're going
to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been feeding it, probably been
feeding it for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been giving it nutrients,
probably longer than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It flowered for nine weeks, then hopefully
flushed for two.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't remove all of the nutrients at
that point when we flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make sure that you get all the
nutrients out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you had any bugs or any problems,
I would not recommend recycling that soil
[SPEAKER_02]: in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get rid of that dirt because you don't
want to bring those bugs, those pests,
[SPEAKER_02]: those issues back into the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email keeps opening on my computer on
its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to recycle the soil,
first of all, I would try to remove as
[SPEAKER_02]: much of the organic matter from the soil
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get all the root balls, get all the roots
out of there because we don't have much to
[SPEAKER_02]: clean that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd put it into a container, then I would
probably add more soil to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would dilute it with some fresh soil,
get some fresh soil charged in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe like a third to half fresh soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix that up, then I would add some
microbes to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would water in some enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those enzymes will help break down all the
old dead shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's anything you don't want in
there, that enzyme will also help clean up
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a small pathogen or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get enough microbes and enzymes in
there to overrun all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a little bit of time, maybe a day
or three for that shit to get active,
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbes, the enzymes to move around,
stir it all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, in my opinion, at that point,
it is ready to mix with perlite or
[SPEAKER_02]: persilite and go right back into action.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you flushed it, as long as you
cleaned it out, as long as you put some
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and some enzymes in there,
I think you can recycle it if you did not
[SPEAKER_02]: have a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had a problem, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I am not an expert at recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do that very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer not to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to buy fresh soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my soil that comes from the grow
will end up in the garden outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: or we fill some of Mike's fucking untilled
land because he's got a new yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes for things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a friend across town.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to chime in with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to reuse it in the
garden, there's a bunch of other places
[SPEAKER_03]: you can reuse it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best vegetable gardens I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were terrible clay, nasty, sandy dirt in a
bad backyard mixed 50-50 with old
[SPEAKER_03]: soil-less mix and root ball compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of mine goes to a house just a few
blocks that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a summer garden every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got tomatoes and onions and peppers
and all the stuff you could imagine that
[SPEAKER_02]: we grow around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes and gets my old soil and takes it
and then brings me back vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot complain about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it I do recycle, but some of it,
once it gets old, I choose not to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not eco-friendly, but as long
as it ends up back in a garden outside
[SPEAKER_02]: some more, I think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do no-till stuff,
you could just pull it out and put it
[SPEAKER_02]: right back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you've got bugs or anything,
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had powdery mildew, if you had
thrips, if you had mites, I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend it because you're just going to
bring those right back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to love to live in that
dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been rambling on about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an expert at recycling soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my basic guidance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more to this message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure to get through all of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, during COVID-19, my access to RO
water from the store could be restricted.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the situation arise that I couldn't get
RO, would the calcium buildup do any harm
[SPEAKER_02]: in a vegetant or would it just build white
powder on everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming you've watered and let it dry
a couple of times and you see that little
[SPEAKER_02]: white ring around the bottom of your pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on how much calcium you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we talked about in the previous
email, do a water test, check the PEMs,
[SPEAKER_02]: check the EC and the PPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants want a little bit of calcium,
but not ridiculous amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a lot of hard water,
you could potentially OD the plants on
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may want to consider getting a big boy
or a small boy filter, but check the
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be anything to worry about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, do that water test.
[SPEAKER_02]: The calcium buildup, doing any harm,
if you're seeing it, it may be a bit much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know how long you've been
using whatever water you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how long it's been
building up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the edge of the sink and shit,
you're going to see buildup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't get too paranoid on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're seeing it in your pots,
it may be something to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I don't know if you've answered
this, but I remember hearing in one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes, not to mix liquid add-ons with
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently using Gaia Greens,
all purpose, 444 dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I be able to use liquid karma
without doing any harm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there even any cons to mixing the two?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've said not to use liquid with
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think I was talking about is
sometimes if you have got an all organic
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, many of the bottled nutrients
are buffered and chelated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may have higher low pHs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things in those bottles may
destroy or disrupt your organic
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what could be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to guess, but just
imagine how non-organic things destroy
[SPEAKER_02]: organic things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just wipe it right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to be careful when mixing
products like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can absolutely mix liquids and
powders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put dry veg bloom base newts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put dry veg bloom shine into a
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I add liquid new millennium
nutrients to that all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can add the liquids and the dry
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the organic and non-organic stuff
that's going to cause you possible
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: This person said they're using Gaia Greens
and they want to add liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Liquid karma will work well with almost
any nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got kelp in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to add microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to add density.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to add flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think liquid karma would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to increase your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not things that are going to burn the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and add the liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go on to list a lot of details of
their grow, which we don't need to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into because I think I understand how to
answer the question without that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm looking about your grow sounds
like it's doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything sounds like he's even added
perlite, just like I said before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read the last part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, lastly, I'm very excited to tell
you that I have ordered some of your
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up orange, gas, lemon,
Jeffrey and strawberry starbursts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a beautiful mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got oranges, lemons and the
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a really nice grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start posting pics, most likely
around the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it almost time for fall?
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you send this?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we've got to wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to check the date and if it came
from last year, it'd be fall time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard you last night on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know this person, Instagram live
saying no one ever follows through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I made the joke that everybody says
they're going to take pictures and nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram sends me the pics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say they're going to send,
but I hope you do my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it says, where are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't be the best, but I will bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to your pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're quality photos, I will be happy
to send them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to send me pics of my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have intentions of starting my first
breeding project sometime next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, from the bottom of my
heart, thank you for all that you do for
[SPEAKER_02]: this community and arming us new growers
with the knowledge, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to seeing your breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what you create,
what comes out of your palette?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it says, if you're ever up in Canada,
please let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, it sounds like we got somewhere to
go hang out now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they signed it from your new friend
Tonto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Tonto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I answered all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of great things going on
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure that I've got the same
message.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of great things going on in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know if you have any more
questions, how else I can help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know how the breeding project goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hopmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, I think that was four emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to call that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that sounds like we've done enough
for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should probably stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Save some for the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we still recording?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know that Zoom is still
recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a minute there, the screen went kind
of weird on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to get paranoid on you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may not even cut that part out of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had any major glitches yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to shut up about that
and keep talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the dice keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Troll the dice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Mike, thanks for hanging out with me
again, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't give you much room to talk in
this one, but you make a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a great cohost, a great show buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still off the Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been months and months.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not even going to- It's off the Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm off the cellular.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a brave new fucking world,
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to improve ourselves a little
bit every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of yourselves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fix your diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fix your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not here for motivational speeches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to grow cannabis and burp into
a microphone, apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Mike, I'm going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrap it up, homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to tell the fine ladies and
gentlemen how they can find you on social
[SPEAKER_02]: media?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find me on Twitter.
