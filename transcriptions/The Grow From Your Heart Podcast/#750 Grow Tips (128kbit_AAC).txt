[SPEAKER_00]: all of my friends to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently realized that I did miss the
birthday for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On March 28th, the podcast turned eight
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why I just noticed that and
just cited that in my other show notes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but happy late birthday to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we've been doing this for eight
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who's been
listening since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all the people who've just
jumped on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support, the words of
encouragement, the wisdom, the
[SPEAKER_00]: constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for putting up with all the throat
clearing and the dab rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of positive
feedback lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great emails, lots of great
YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I complained that the YouTube,
I didn't read the comments because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a minefield, a bunch of just
crappy comments, a bunch of negativity in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comments have really turned around on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing but positivity, nothing but
goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't delete the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let YouTube do the thing and the
comments come and go and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for the great YouTube
comments, for the encouraging emails,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the social media shout outs and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That like encourages me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It recharges me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a little bit of a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's try to get the show to 10,000
subscribers on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting close right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be about 9,600 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, if you are currently listening
on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher Radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where you might be listening,
but do please subscribe to the show on the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on YouTube,
now just simply click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do me the big favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me get to 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a goal that I have set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh also, please do continue to send me the
great cannabis culture and cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love fueling the show off of questions
that come from the viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me know that if I'm helping one
person, if one person asked me the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, that means it probably 20 or 30,
maybe 100 people out there actually needed
[SPEAKER_00]: that advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do send me those grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow help tab on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go fill out a grow help questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help me answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do keep those coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I love making listener
generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more quick thing to ramble
about before we jump into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like the podcast episodes with just
me or do you prefer a guest at the table?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys like Zoom podcasts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you prefer me do the show solo or do
you like somebody on Zoom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom shows kind of bug me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I was on another podcast and you
can see me hesitating to reply and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see us kind of talking over each other
because Zoom has just a microsecond of a
[SPEAKER_00]: millisecond of a delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be like, hey, how was your day?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll be just a quick delay
before the other person replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time they've replied,
I'm already going, are you cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, I can hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this weird just fucking
stumble over each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom drives me crazy, but it's better than
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are into seeing people on
Zoom, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd prefer me to have people here,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you just prefer the podcast
by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make adjustments as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I'm asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the main topics of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to talk about a couple of grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'm going to mention something that
I saw in a grow recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a friend's grow, just a regular
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend was watering their plants
with the runoff from their dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did express my concern because I'm
not sure that that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside of that dehumidifier is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the gunk and grime that's in your
environment is gathering up on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: parts inside of that dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are coils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are a lot of things
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's water collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the water runs down a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dehumidifier, anytime I've taken
apart a humidifier or dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been disgusting on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could only imagine that disgusting shit
is landing right in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're able to test that water
and you're making sure that it's clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing funky in that water,
I really wouldn't recommend watering your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with the runoff from your
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say, also your air
conditioner condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same way about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the same function.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say that's clean,
distilled water, but I do not trust the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to run off of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever it ran off of, dribbled off
of, could be dirty, could be funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: could have metals in it, could have funk
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the bottom line that I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend using the water from
your dehumidifier to water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do use that to like, if you've got a
power washer or a power sprayer,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe use that to clean the tables or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that for cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it for gray water, but do not use that
for feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a qualified argument that
you'd like to say why it is okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: go ahead, send me the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am open to feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had this conversation before.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion, still stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend feeding the plants your
dehumidifier water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I saw my friend doing
was he was not shaking the bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are feeding bottled nutrients
to your plants, when you pick up that
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle before you even unscrew the lid,
before you even think about doing anything
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, I usually place my forefinger
over the top of the cap to make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: cap is sealed on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick it up, give it a little twist,
make sure the cap is sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I shake the shit out of that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those products have a lot of heavy stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to shake them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, for the first few weeks as you're
feeding, you're just going to feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you get down, you're going to feed it
all of the main stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you get to the bottom, you're going to
have a bunch of chunks left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake your nutrient bottles vigorously
before you feed them to your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: before you mix up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, check the expiration dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things don't last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird things will happen inside the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you mix that weird product with other
products, even more weird shit will
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the expiration date.
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece of advice, I do recommend you
mix your potassium silicate first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're putting silicates in the water,
put that in the water first, then give it
[SPEAKER_00]: a stir, then mix in your other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter to me very specifically
which other products you put in which
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go the silicates, then your base
nutrients, then follow up with whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be done, the Cal Mag,
the potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just whichever bottles you're buying,
I don't know the order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then adjust the pH, then add your
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was going to say is stir in all of
your products, everything except your
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, then adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently saw somebody adjust the pH of
their water using the little pH adjuster
[SPEAKER_00]: and some drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the water to 6.4, then they added
their nutrients to it, then they added
[SPEAKER_00]: their microbes to it, then they fed it to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the correct order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about why that's not the
correct order.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the nutrient solution which we are
feeding our plants to be somewhere between
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.2 and 6.5, 6.6, probably about 6.2,
6.4 is where I hover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're saying different numbers,
do that what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about what I standardize,
what I normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mix the water up and then we watched
our friend put the pH drops in there to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it to the right pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add nutrients, it's going to
drastically change the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would put your nutrients in first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your potassium silicate, shake the
bottle, put the potassium silicate in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your next bottle, probably your base
nutrient, shake the shit out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it out, put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In whatever size container you're mixing,
I usually mix in if it's a small batch,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a 5 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a big batch, it's a 55 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's 500 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume you're mixing into a 5
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your 5 gallon bucket mostly filled
with water most of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start with your potassium
silicate, shake the bottle, put it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring unit, pour it into the
container, then give it a little wipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your measuring unit a little bit of a
wipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a shot glass or maybe something
bigger depending on how big I'm measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wipe that out, shake up your next bottle,
pour out the desired amount, toss it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your res, clean that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process until you're done,
then adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you put your pH meter in
there and you start putting your drops in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to get it to the amount that you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can check the EC at that time
also if you would like, but adjusting the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is the final step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do that right before you feed
it to the plants because it will change if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do anything else to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do anything else to it,
other than add microbes, that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I would recommend doing after the
pH, but anything else, it will change the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to add more water because
it's not full enough or if you've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: too high of an EC or a PPM, adjust that pH
after all of those adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then water carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something else I noticed that my
friends grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big pots, if you've got a
three or a five gallon pot, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend dumping all of your water
directly into the middle of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water around the outer edge of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your plants sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably a 10, 12, maybe a 14 inch
diameter plant or a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water the outer edge and then work your
way in with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is going to work its way in
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the roots of that plant that want
that water are out at the outer edge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about, look at the shape of a
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the shape of most plants that you
see in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the shape of a cannabis
plant, it is shaped kind of a triangular
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the top leaves,
they work like the shingles of a roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those top leaves, when the water hits
them, they will droop down and the water
[SPEAKER_00]: will run down those leaves right down to
the next set of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will gently run it down and
outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it goes down, it goes outward every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of the way that the
leaves in the plant are shaped and what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it lands on the ground,
you'll notice there's a nice circle around
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just get a nice light rain,
a nice little spring sprinkle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't over rain too much,
I almost said over water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any control of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't over rain too much,
you'll see just a nice circle around your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants around the bottom, like they were
sitting under an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're providing their own umbrella
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want all that water right there
on the toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it out there on the roots,
the feeder roots that are out at the edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water that outer edge of your pots,
of your buckets, of your containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and water the inside a little bit lighter
because that's where you run the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: over watering is flooding that inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my disclaimer, if you're running
little plants in large pots and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not fully established at this time,
water as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water where the roots are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get that pot filled with
roots, the plants really established and
[SPEAKER_00]: really banging, that's when you want to go
ahead and start watering the outer
[SPEAKER_00]: circumference, I think is the word I'm
looking for, the outer edge of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then work your way in toward the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those outer roots are the thirsty roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the roots that need the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already going out there to get the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that umbrella idea,
the shingles idea, the roofing idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really keep that in mind when you're
thinking about watering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I want to touch on
before we start wrapping up the episode is
[SPEAKER_00]: don't overlook the importance of your
vegetative space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen several grows recently where you
can tell that the grower obviously put 75
[SPEAKER_00]: to 90% of their funding, energy,
effort, and time into the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the veg space, you can tell that they
put 10, 15, maybe 25% of their time,
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, budget, effort, love and care into
that veg space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg space is your foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get excited in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you drag the plants into flower,
it's like, oh yeah, flowers are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pictures are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progress is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without a solid foundation,
you're not going to get the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pictures, the crop, the harvest,
the potency, the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that stuff will come if you don't
have a quality veg setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop overlooking the importance of the
vegetative phase, the vegetative space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start allocating more of your budget to
that veg room, the veg space, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people underfeeding in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that it could just kind of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it comes to flower, they'll
start really feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our plants take up and absorb and
store a lot of their nitrogen during the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of their nutrients come from veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So build them up, get them strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't put, so a lot of people say
it's just a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to feed it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, think about it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want high-performance cannabis
plants or do you just want lazy couch
[SPEAKER_00]: potato plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow plants that look like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five and I weigh about 190
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hide behind a flagpole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in pretty good shape, but I am super
skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is I am not training for any
fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get in the ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do anything anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or your other option, I could go to
the gym every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could pound protein shakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put steroids in my neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do all kinds of crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could Hannevar up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I could be the big Brock Lesnar
looking dude, but I'd have to put in a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of fucking more work to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have cannabis plants that look
like me or you can have cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like Brock Lesnar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to feed them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do the work to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give them the, the work,
the extra love, the extra care,
[SPEAKER_00]: the extra attention, or do you just want
to water them and just let them survive
[SPEAKER_00]: and let them grow up and be tall and
skinny like me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody really wants deep down
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want the fucking Brock Lesnar
ultimate warrior, fucking ninja warrior,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking savage plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we really all want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get to that kind of a crop,
you've got to do the work every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are details that need to be managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room needs to be checked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment needs to be inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water needs to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The watering timing needs to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you defoliate on the right day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you pop and twist on the right day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the fan coming on at just the right
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of details to dial in if you
want to get that Brock Lesnar bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds can only be in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your buds can only be as powerful,
potent, heavy, dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can only be as quality as your veg
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your veg is like a five out of 10,
your flowers are going, no matter how good
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowering room is, your flowers are
going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a five, maybe a six or seven out of
a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best you're ever going to get
if your veg room is shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your bedroom is a seven or eight,
you've got the potential of eight or nine
[SPEAKER_00]: buds coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not going to do great if you're
not paying a lot of attention to the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your lighting right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people overlook the importance of
a light and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a light that will get the plants
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if those plants fucking grew?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they exploded?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they had vigorous growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they were growing so quickly and
so healthily that you had to cut clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and harvest or cut clones and get into
flower early?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you were reusing the right
equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if your airflow was better in your
veg space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people with terrible
airflow because they say, oh, it can take
[SPEAKER_00]: the high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will thrive if you give them a
better VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That vapor pressure deficit will make a
huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're feeding these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do need food even in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them the CalMag that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them microbes to get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them anything you could imagine to
get them boosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while you're in there, give them some
general maintenance and care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the plants to grow up and get
thick, take off all that bullshit off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom that's wasting time, energy,
and space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light's not going to get down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just wasting plant energy by
producing all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you popping and twisting the stems at
the right times?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will definitely help your plants get
more strength, get more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will slow down the vertical growth when
it comes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing all that maintenance that
needs to be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff adds up to strong
vigorous plants and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't train them, if you don't
prepare them, when you send them into
[SPEAKER_00]: battle, they will not be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not be what you were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not get the desired outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pay for the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you do, the electricity,
the electric company, you can't call them
[SPEAKER_00]: and go, hey, I kind of fucked up this
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get as many buds as we were
hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like half a pound short.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you'd give me a deal on
electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go, ha ha ha,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay the electric bill and if you don't,
we're turning it off and you don't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to get the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be in there spending time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not put quality time in that grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just hang out and stare at
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called the grower's gaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learn a lot, but don't just be in there
wasting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go play video games until all the
work is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend the time that you need to spend in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to spend a lot of
time on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not spend a few extra minutes and make
it great?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spend a few minutes and make it
good, or you could spend a lot of minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: and make it fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to feed the plants,
feed them quality nutrients at a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: time on a good schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay for the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not feed the plants properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: The airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the airflow right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys see where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do it, do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the best herb that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that veg space set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that veg space dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you move them into flower,
there's no transition skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go, oh yeah, we were waiting for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here come the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few weeks later, you start seeing
the biggest, fattest buds building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I really do try to inspire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to overwhelm you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do talk about doing things correctly,
doing the proper steps, adding a few steps
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it right, taking a few notes so
that you can remember what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about having the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the right gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of shit's really expensive
and times are tough, but if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it, do it right and make it worth
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time you harvest,
invest some of that harvest back into your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here to inspire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to intimidate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a lot to take in, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep watching, keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get you all caught up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this will be intimidating after a
few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is all I've got for you
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it went by super quickly,
but I had fun.
