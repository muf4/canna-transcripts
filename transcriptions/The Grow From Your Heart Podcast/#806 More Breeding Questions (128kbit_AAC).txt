[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go family.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Natalie rise and you are tuned to
the highest frequency the grow from your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart podcast with rusted Jeff Yeah,
big up yourself every time rusted Jeff iry
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the place you want to be You know,
you got to grow from your heart to know
[SPEAKER_01]: from your heart to keep it locked the grow
from your heart podcast starts now
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world
I'm your host rusted Jeff this is episode
[SPEAKER_00]: eight hundred and six of the grow from
your heart podcast got a fun show lined up
[SPEAKER_00]: for you in this episode we're going to
give away free seeds that's right I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give away free iry genetic seeds
hang out we'll talk more about the free
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds later in this episode before we get
to the free seeds I do want to apologize
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to make an adjustment on iry
direct we can no longer ship to Canada the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian Border Patrol has sent me a
letter saying please stop then they sent
[SPEAKER_00]: me another letter saying no really please
fucking stop I don't want that third
[SPEAKER_00]: letter so at this point I have stopped
sending orders to Canada I apologize if
[SPEAKER_00]: your order did not make it to Canada send
me a message I will gladly send you a
[SPEAKER_00]: refund also you guys who are expecting
seeds for prizes in Canada maybe they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make it maybe they won't I apologize send
me a message if you don't get them maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you a t-shirt or something up
there in Canada again I apologize it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: my decision it wasn't my move this is the
decision of the Canadian Border Patrol and
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mess with the Canadian
Border Patrol any more than I already have
[SPEAKER_00]: so I apologize no seeds are going to make
it to Canada in the foreseeable future but
[SPEAKER_00]: we will work on something as soon as
possible also I want to send a big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my buddy white mic white mic was on
the last episode if you have not watched
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous episode I encourage you to go
back and watch the episode with white mic
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about hanging out at the dude
grows cup it was a wonderful time to have
[SPEAKER_00]: white mic on the show first off big fist
bump and a thank you shout out to white
[SPEAKER_00]: mic then thank you to everybody who
commented on white mics reappearance on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast a lot of people were excited
to see Mike on the show a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: were requesting hey bring Mike back there
you go guys Mike was back on the show I do
[SPEAKER_00]: plan on having Mike back on the podcast in
the future because I've got a setup idea a
[SPEAKER_00]: little production idea that'll be a little
bit different I was cool with the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: did it side by side but it kind of looked
like the cannabis version of are you
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage if you get that joke you're
fucking awesome but I was hard to edit
[SPEAKER_00]: that one a little bit symmetry problems
there I found a new way in my head that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think will work better look better on
camera so Mike I can't wait to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: back over bro we're gonna change the setup
a little bit and I have a good idea to
[SPEAKER_00]: make us both look sharp on camera it's
gonna be great so Mike you'll be back you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys Mike will be back on the show big
thanks to Mike for being on the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was saying thank you for all of the
great words of encouragement on Mike's
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance on the show it was fun taking
Mike to the DGC Cup so many people there
[SPEAKER_00]: knew Mike Mike felt like a rock star at
the event so shout out to white Mike let's
[SPEAKER_00]: keep moving I got a lot of energy today

[SPEAKER_00]: part of this podcast it is time to jump
into everybody's favorite portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart podcast that is the
grow question and answer part today I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: answering a question that came from the
grow help tab on the I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: website if you go to my website I read
genetics comm there are a bunch of tabs on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top one of them does say grow help or
grow questions click on there that will
[SPEAKER_00]: take you to a little questionnaire we ask
a few questions about your grow and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we give you the opportunity to type in
your main concern main question about your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow this one came from our friend Gabe on
the grow from your arm the I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: website grow help tab the question goes
Ross to Jeff thank you for reading my
[SPEAKER_00]: question and I hope you and the fam are
having an amazing year bro everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: iry so far thanks for the well wishes I
hope you and your family and your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: are killing it as well it says I've been
watching a lot of the podcast with other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders like yourself one topic that has
caught my eye was breeding out the Herm
[SPEAKER_00]: gene then he said I have a strain that was
fire but had a super high Herm rate an
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex rate is the word I prefer to use
what would be the best way to breed this
[SPEAKER_00]: out would it be worth reversing stable
phenos if that gene is recessive PS if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do read this on the podcast my friends
call me Panda big shout out to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Panda what's up bro thank you for the
great question um as a breeder so I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of different answers on a couple
of different levels you have to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind I make seeds for a somewhat
commercial level I'm selling seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: people on the internet I need my seeds to
be top-notch reliable not have any
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits hidden in those seeds in
any generations in any form because my
[SPEAKER_00]: customers my clients my friends the ivory
army do not deserve intersex plants it's
[SPEAKER_00]: my job to weed that out so if this were me
this strain that is fire but shows
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits would disappear I would
cut that bitch down I would get rid of it
[SPEAKER_00]: it would not last in my garden with all of
the seeds all of the strains all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones all of the options why would you
pick a plant that's got intersex traits to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with set yourself up for success is
my opinion that's my situation in my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding company in my grow in my rules
but you may not be selling seeds you might
[SPEAKER_00]: just be making seeds for yourself these
seeds aren't gonna go anywhere if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds for yourself it may be worth
breeding out that intersex trait but on
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's putting seeds out to other
people I don't want to do that but you
[SPEAKER_00]: could breed it out you could find another
plant so you've got the female that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know makes intersex traits I would grow
until you find one that does not make the
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex if you can find if you've got
several seeds if you can find one tested
[SPEAKER_00]: if you finally get one that doesn't make
intersex traits I would pollinate it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the different male and then start working
on the back cross make sure every
[SPEAKER_00]: generation is tested thoroughly to make
sure it does not have that intersex trait
[SPEAKER_00]: hidden in there you could also reverse it
if you find a phenotype that you really
[SPEAKER_00]: like but like I said a moment ago this is
like um this girl is really pretty she's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty nice to you but on the weekends she
stabs you with the butter knife in your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutsack like why don't you just find one
that doesn't stab you with the butter
[SPEAKER_00]: knife in your nutsack it would be that
easy in my opinion this plant can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: that good that it's worth having this
intersex trait so you asked what would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to breed out that intersex
trait find one that is minimally intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: which doesn't even make sense to me that's
intersex intersex is intersex it's got to
[SPEAKER_00]: go but find one that doesn't show intersex
traits or minimal pollinate that one with
[SPEAKER_00]: a stable solid male and then repeat the
process keep back crossing with that male
[SPEAKER_00]: and then eventually you could wash out
that trait but the first thing I wrote is
[SPEAKER_00]: why don't you have other options like
you've got to have other options you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a free pack of seeds since
you sent me a question so you could start
[SPEAKER_00]: with my seeds and not have to run those
intersex plants would be my theory my dude
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a better answer for you my
friend panda instead of telling you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with something that's intersex
that's not setting yourself up for success
[SPEAKER_00]: that's trying to work out a problem with
the plant that you know that's problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: when there are thousands of packs of seeds
available that probably aren't as
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic so get one that doesn't stab
you in the nuts with the butter knife is
[SPEAKER_00]: my theory and then breed with that so I'm
gonna send you a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you send me a question on the
grow help tab and I read that question
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the show you win free seeds my
friend Panda as long as you are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: States and I don't have to ship to Canada
please do send me your shipping address
[SPEAKER_00]: with a real name I can't call you Panda on
your box that's not gonna fly but send me
[SPEAKER_00]: a name and an address and I will send you
a free pack of I read genetic seeds my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend if you are in Canada let me know
and I will send you a t-shirt and some
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers I apologize like I said before
you just can't have any seeds up there in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada until I get your government to play
nice with me also I wish I had a better
[SPEAKER_00]: answer for you but as a breeder who puts a
lot of work into this plant has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: passion for this plant I can't find the
heart in me to tell you to breed with this
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plant I'd tell you to get the
fuck away from that that's what probably
[SPEAKER_00]: what a therapist and a good breeder and a
good grower and a good podcaster should
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you to do run from that problem you
can do better all right let's move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: also bro thank you for the great question
and I hope to
[SPEAKER_00]: see pictures of those seeds when you do I
hope it goes well for you then it says can
[SPEAKER_00]: you please explain how to finish a seed
harvest the first detailed question is
[SPEAKER_00]: should the light schedule stay at 1212 um
I've done several podcasts on changing my
[SPEAKER_00]: light schedule from 1212 to 18 hours on
and six hours off for seeded crops if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've bred made completed several crops
of seeds before and you know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for and a seeded crop I always
recommend turning that light to 18 six on
[SPEAKER_00]: your first time maybe wait a little while
to do that just so you can see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens with the plants understand it
before you fuck with it but the first few
[SPEAKER_00]: times you breed do that 1212 all the way
till the end then eventually you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: want to change that light timer to 18
hours on and six hours off after
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination if my plants are seeded I
generally do that about 10 days after
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination that's my goal so I'll
pollinate 10 days later I'll flip that
[SPEAKER_00]: timer back to 18 six now you're gonna
freak out you're gonna say that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up my plants no that would fuck up
your flowers if you were growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: usable smokable photographable buds is
photographable a word anyway photogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that would fuck up your buds these
plants are going to look like shit these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to look like shit they're
going to start to revege but that's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: big deal because we're not growing for
buds I'm not growing for buds when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding my plants my 100% focus is seed I
want as many and as many healthy and as
[SPEAKER_00]: many high quality germinating seeds and as
few crappy white seeds as I can possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: have in my harvest and I achieve that by
pollinating two times I pollinate at the
[SPEAKER_00]: peak pollination time I let that male
plant build up a load again pollinate one
[SPEAKER_00]: more time cut him down let the plants
absorb that pollen let them adjust for
[SPEAKER_00]: about a week then I switch that light to
18 six and I get a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: positively healthy amazing beautiful seeds
so that's the way I do that now the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give those plants more light is
because I believe light is the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: source of energy for these plants so I
give it more light that lets more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant they can metabolize more
guess what they can feed that seed more
[SPEAKER_00]: also you can cut down on several days of
the flowering cycle most of the time it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take about six to seven maybe eight weeks
for some seeds to be done you'll have them
[SPEAKER_00]: done by the end of week six with this
method so by changing the light cycle back
[SPEAKER_00]: it does make the plants look a little bit
wonky they start to revege they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit fluffy they start growing kind
of crazy but that's not the point we make
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of amazing seeds is what I'm going
for now if you don't want your plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: look crazy if you don't want them to grow
wildly if you don't want them to revege
[SPEAKER_00]: only change them back to 18 six for the
last 10 to 14 days at the end of your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle this will still speed you
up this will still give you healthy fat
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds but it won't make the plant room
look like shit as bad all right so do
[SPEAKER_00]: change the light cycle is something I do
same temperature and humidity basically
[SPEAKER_00]: yes sometimes I don't like the room to get
too humid when the seeds are in there I
[SPEAKER_00]: may let it get a little bit if you've got
struggles if you can get it too humid or
[SPEAKER_00]: too dry I would prefer too dry with the
seeds in there also don't spray the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: once they've been at all I was going to
say once they've been pollinated don't
[SPEAKER_00]: spray them and I spit as I said it which
is pretty ironic I sprayed it and sate it
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't spray the plants if you're going
to breed to them you want all those
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols to be as healthy and fat and
robust as possible so avoid any sprays on
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants especially thick oils before
and or after pollination you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use predator bugs in there if you're going
to use a pest prevention program the
[SPEAKER_00]: predator bugs may be ideal so same temp
and humidity keep the feeding flower
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition or some NPK ratio thanks in
advance so generally you don't need to add
[SPEAKER_00]: the bloom boosters because you're not
making big fat buds we're not growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds like I was talking about earlier
we're growing for seed so you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: the bloom boosters in there as much all
the the bat guano the what's what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: product the bud swell I would take out the
buds well because I don't need the buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: swell I want seed swell which is a totally
different feeding regimen so I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to a vegetative nutrient with a lot
of microbes and add a little bit of more
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalamag than usual and I said this on
another podcast recently I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever talked about this publicly until
I was on that cannabis podcast but add
[SPEAKER_00]: some amino products to your seed regimen
when you're feeding the plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded and those liquid aminos will help
you create more healthy fatter more robust
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds which will also be more resistant to
problems when they do grow so add that the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid aminos boost up the Kalamag just a
little bit and then feed that vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient is basically what you want to do
put some microbes in there feed whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else you feed to keep that plant optimized
and healthy but basically base newts a
[SPEAKER_00]: basic NPK from your vegetative nutrients a
little bit of extra Kalamag just to boost
[SPEAKER_00]: that up and then some liquid amino
products would definitely help in there if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can so I think that is most of how to
finish the seed harvest do you mean like
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're done so eventually the seeds
are going to start getting harder right
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll start seeing them popping out of
the plants they'll just start peeking out
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top the plants will pop open the
calyx will pop open a little seed will pop
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there the bract will open up it'll
be peeking out like I'm almost ready daddy
[SPEAKER_00]: pull some of those seeds out of there from
different parts of the plant and give them
[SPEAKER_00]: a squeeze if they rupture they're not
ready yet if you can squeeze it pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good to where you get a dent in your
finger a little indention a little mark
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed is probably done you should know
by now what a done seed looks like you've
[SPEAKER_00]: played with so many seeds right you've
grown them you could roll it on the table
[SPEAKER_00]: and press it it doesn't pop that's what
you want but you can also go too far so
[SPEAKER_00]: once they start hard being hard enough to
where they don't crunch you want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: them out pretty soon after that because if
you wait too long they'll become too hard
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll be hard to germinate and when
you put them in the water or the root
[SPEAKER_00]: cubes or whatever they won't pop open
you'll have to scar them or crunch them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to get them pop to pop open so
when they're hard enough that is about
[SPEAKER_00]: when it is harvest time you'll have to
determine that on your own the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest this is just how I do it there are
a thousand ways to skin a cat you pick
[SPEAKER_00]: your way I'm gonna tell you the way that I
do it a few days before harvest time I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go in the grow room and pick off all of
the big leaves any leaf I can pull off I
[SPEAKER_00]: just take it off right now I don't need
that coming in the dry room with me at all
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just gonna keep humidity in the
room and I don't want that with my seed
[SPEAKER_00]: drying so just get all those big leaves
off anything I can take off chop it off
[SPEAKER_00]: then I stop watering I let the plants get
kind of dry before I cut them down I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need all that extra humidity in the grow
room or in the dry room so I'll let them
[SPEAKER_00]: dry a little bit don't water them then I
cut them down then I take the plant tag
[SPEAKER_00]: that is in the pot and I attach that to
the plant just use some duct tape or a
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap or whatever and make sure that plant
tag stays with my plant I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck this part up it's very important to
me so I got my plant my plant tag
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling together I put that on a I've
got a little hanger thing that I use and I
[SPEAKER_00]: hang those in a spot in the dry and cure
area I chop all the plants down and I
[SPEAKER_00]: spread them out a little bit and I just
let them hang dry I've got these um
[SPEAKER_00]: they're stir light bins they're actually
bins that are made to put like store your
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes or your shoes in and they slide
underneath the bed they got wheels on one
[SPEAKER_00]: end these bins are made to slide under the
bed they're kind of shallow I like these
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can set them underneath the
plant and as the plant dries if any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds do fall out it'll fall down into
that bin eventually these plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get real real dry I don't really pay
attention to temperature humidity airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that in this room the
room is just naturally ambiently
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable it's a cool it's a decent room
it's cool it's dry it's dark it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable for having plants I don't have
to adjust anything for the drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing of seeded plants in this room so in
this room they'll be dry in about 10 to 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days I want to get them real dry so once
they start getting dry enough to where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about the buds crumbling and the
seeds falling out I will take the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically cut the sticks off and take
a glove and just grab the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: branch and just pull the branch out to
where all the buds fall off into that
[SPEAKER_00]: Rubbermaid or that stir light bin that I
was talking about earlier just catch all
[SPEAKER_00]: the and seeds are going to fall out as
this happens depending on how dry those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds are it'll just go crunch crunch
crunch crunch crunch and it'll fall right
[SPEAKER_00]: into that bin I'm collecting all the buds
and all the seeds into there I'll do that
[SPEAKER_00]: with every plant and carefully do not
cross the seeds from one bin to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you move the bins when
you're pulling shit so seeds don't fly
[SPEAKER_00]: into the wrong bin so I'll get all of the
buds off of the sticks now I've just got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of bins with sticks then I'll put on
fresh gloves because by now my gloves are
[SPEAKER_00]: caked and torn put on some fresh gloves
then I go to those bins and sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: wear a mask too because this can get very
dusty then I let it get super dry and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just take the buds in my hands and just
crunch them crunch crunch crunch crunch
[SPEAKER_00]: crunch just rub all the buds through my
hands there's other ways to do this I've
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown the buds into a five gallon bucket
and use the paint stir paddle on a drill
[SPEAKER_00]: it is and that'll go ahead and spin all
your fucking seeds out of your buds real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick but try to be gentle with the seeds
break them up with my hands break them up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the drill bit I've used a big spoon
and gone in there just use a spoon to
[SPEAKER_00]: break up the buds I want to get that
turned into dust I want to beat all that
[SPEAKER_00]: bud material into dust then I take my bin
and shake it now at this point all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds have fallen to the bottom most of
the weed material is up at the top we call
[SPEAKER_00]: that the chaff at this point I basically
kind of scoop that off don't go too deep
[SPEAKER_00]: to where you're getting to the seeds and
just scoop the chaff right off the top set
[SPEAKER_00]: that to the side give it a shake make sure
there are no seeds in there you'll be cool
[SPEAKER_00]: then at this point you've got to get the
seeds out of all of that weed or the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: out of all of those seeds is how I look at
it at this point but I use a machine to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it I've got a little machine that's got a
couple leveled angles and a computer fan
[SPEAKER_00]: and it catches all the junk in one drawer
and the seeds go into another that machine
[SPEAKER_00]: was quite expensive you could probably
build one I'm sure there are seed sorter
[SPEAKER_00]: machines available online but you're gonna
have to figure out a way to sort all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out of that junk I've seen people
use a vacuum don't turn it up super high
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't go hard with it but you can if
you've got the seeds in a bucket or a bin
[SPEAKER_00]: with material on top you can gently just
kind of feather that vacuum through there
[SPEAKER_00]: and stir things and you can pick up the
weed material and leave the seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed material is much lighter than the
seed so if you get the feel for it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're clumsy if you're a goofy kind of
person don't try that when you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: suck up all the fucking seeds but if you
got some faith in yourself kind of you can
[SPEAKER_00]: suck up the chaff material without sucking
up the seeds so at this point I've
[SPEAKER_00]: separated all of the material from all of
the seeds I will leave the seeds sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: out in a cool dry dark safe place for a
little while I have had a friend sort his
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds before this was not me this was
really a friend I would admit it if this
[SPEAKER_00]: were me he had a bag of seeds on a table
or a cup of seeds on a table they were
[SPEAKER_00]: open and a fucking mouse stole the seeds
I'm not joking a lot of good seeds we
[SPEAKER_00]: never got to grow that plant we don't know
what he even made because the mouse got
[SPEAKER_00]: all of his beans so think about that put
him some more recruiters won't get to him
[SPEAKER_00]: but I leave them open for a while and let
them get really dry sometimes I put one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those desiccant packs in there to suck up
the moisture not a Boveda pack a desiccant
[SPEAKER_00]: pack something to suck up the moisture not
add moisture but I want to get all the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture out of there then I either put
them depending on how many I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes they go in a big one gallon bag
jars and carefully label that bag I will
[SPEAKER_00]: write the new strain name so let's just
say frequency shift I'll put frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: shift then I'll label about I've got a
seed counter also I run them through the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed counter I'll put how many seeds are
in that bag frequency shift 20,000 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll put the cross New York City
diesel to a reversed Golden Goat then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: put the harvest date on there so I know
when those seeds were pulled I just like
[SPEAKER_00]: to mark shit so that I know how many seeds
when they were pulled that way if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem if you say hey bruv several
people say hey bro I bought a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds and they're not working I can
look at that whole batch and then I can
[SPEAKER_00]: run those myself and see if there's a
problem in there that I missed before that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys happen to discover because you
grow a lot more of those seeds than I do I
[SPEAKER_00]: run small batches and then you guys run I
run 50 or 100 you guys run 10 each and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's thousands of you doing it so
that's a lot of fucking seeds being grown
[SPEAKER_00]: but so that's basically how I do a seed
harvest I pollinate I change the light
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule I feed them pretty solid I
defoliate heavily toward the end let them
[SPEAKER_00]: get dry chop them down let them get super
fucking dry pull off the buds into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bins crunch up the buds pull out the seeds
count the seeds put them in a jar and get
[SPEAKER_00]: them dry as fuck that's the basics I hope
