[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear some jingle and some clang a

[SPEAKER_00]: my new air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making a lot of noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hot day here in Colorado the first
real hot day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be an old man and talk
about the weather but it's hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the air conditioner going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the software and equipment
will cut that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disclaimer there's some background noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been asking where is
the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to the iry army discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a new discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about this on a lot of
episodes but I'm trying to get the word
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if you share the
word with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had friends on discord and they're
not on the iry army discord server please
[SPEAKER_00]: invite them remind them that there was a
change in the server.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are no longer on the old server.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that that's a different
link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things went weird there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have abandoned that server.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have created our own new server.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great new mod team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are I just actually finished up an
hour and 20 minute mod meeting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord mods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of this is there is a new link
to the new updated discord server in the
[SPEAKER_00]: video notes and the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find the new discord server
join us on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are invited on that server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great content a lot of
great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things is the smokers
lounge chat or anybody can just come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and hang out and chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a video chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there at least one night a week
sometimes twice a week depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: busy things get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pop in just depends on if I get
done with my chores or maybe I'm packing
[SPEAKER_00]: up seeds something I'm doing sitting at
the desk that kind of work where I can
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just pop into the live chat hang out
with people answer a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm just hanging out listening
to you guys chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have normal everyday
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we talk very intensely about
growing cannabis and cannabis ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also one of my other favorite parts is the
tester tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send out a lot of tester seeds to people
and they post their reports there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tab and I love seeing what people are
growing the progress of the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also find tabs for most of the
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have created the users and the mods have
created a tab for most of the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say most because they're stuff that's
not even put out yet things they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about that are coming out that will
be out very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hint hint tease tease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've got a list on the side of
every single strain that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on there and you can see
other growers experiences with that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their flowering photos their
grow reports if they had problems if they
[SPEAKER_00]: have questions the answers to those
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find it to be a very great resource
and a useful resource for anybody growing
[SPEAKER_00]: iri genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point here if you are a part of the
iri army the grow from your heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: community which you are if you are
watching or listening I invite you to the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may pop in in the smokers lounge and I
may be hanging out right there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see me taking dabs might get to
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get to ask me your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing to ramble about then we're
going to talk about some of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: topics of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see if you know me at all you
know I'm a huge reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only am I huge I'm also a reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also a huge reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just works out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm 6'5 with dreadlocks down to about
my calf region you guys just in case you
[SPEAKER_00]: wondered how far down these crazy things
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hit the calf area and I'm 6'5 so I am
a huge reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few nights ago I got to go see with my
lovely queen Miss Dread Vibes also known
[SPEAKER_00]: as Miss Zara.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go see the lovely Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about me you know
that I smile weirdly when we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a great musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a great singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a great writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may have a little bit of a crush on
her and my girlfriend is okay with that so
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go snitching on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got to see Natalie sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see her perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about just the recharging of the
energy there that comes from a Natalie
[SPEAKER_00]: Rise concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felt really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to the few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw a couple people there that knew who we
were and what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to the crew that saw us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the great dreadlocks at
the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many people at dreadlocks at
that concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go see some live music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed and able to go get out and
see music again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't have to be reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into that go see whatever
you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into Norwegian death metal go
get your mosh pit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into some Celtic folk dance go
spin your legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing and have a good time is what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your vibes with some good music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your soul up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm fucking rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some cannabis cultivation
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this podcast is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked about cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently got a message from somebody who
was saying that they want to start a new
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that they look up to my company
that they see that what I've been doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted quite they had questions
about how important is seed packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to package seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus mainly on like seed
company with branding and all that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like an official company that's
going out for a seed vendor for retail
[SPEAKER_00]: sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about that type of packaging
and we'll also talk about just bro to bro
[SPEAKER_00]: peer to peer seed exchanges and that sort
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to commercial packaging
something that's very important is
[SPEAKER_00]: branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are not going to know who you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What your vibe is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What your motto is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know anything about you except
this package of seeds that they've got in
[SPEAKER_00]: their hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing that is representing
your company your seeds your expectations
[SPEAKER_00]: of those beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think branding is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the company name on my packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can prominently see I read genetics
displayed at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets you know these are premium seeds
that tells you what the brand is and what
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the package when you flip it over on
the back it tells you the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the middle of the pack it says on
the top once again it says I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want it to be redundant when you
flip it over you see it's I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle I use a sticker that says
the strain indicates what strain it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will put how many weeks it
takes to flower on that package depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on how old my labels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do that sometimes I don't I
should be more fluid with doing that more
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll put the brand the brand on top
the strain in the middle then on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom something I find to be very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my website address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not have the web address on there that
way if there are any questions any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems anything you want to know more
details you can go to the website on my
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a full report on that strain
possibly with a link to a podcast of that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain possibly with discord info all
kinds of great shit linked up to it that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could read about the whole strain get
the info you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main things I think about are the
company name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your company name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously I read genetics that's
printed on the very front then it says
[SPEAKER_00]: premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I created a logo I did not create.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an artist create me a logo big up to
my artist friends names Adam I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: they made me a very cool logo that I feel
represents my brand very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the name is Iry which is a
Jamaican word it's a patois word that
[SPEAKER_00]: means it's got a lot of meanings to it but
basically means to feel really good it's
[SPEAKER_00]: most powerful the most pleasing feeling
you could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as kind of like if you're
sitting on the beach or if you're sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: on a hill a grassy hill and the sun is
setting and you see the waves going maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: and you got your girl on one side and the
dog on the other maybe you're smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: fat joint and everything is just cool man
there's nothing bothering you nothing's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong nothing could go wrong everything
feels right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Iry feeling Iry got the Iry
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my vibe in my brand is obviously got
that Rasta reggae Iry sort of vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of red yellow and green
colors in there which then I use a cross
[SPEAKER_00]: logo that comes heavily from Rasta culture
then on the back when we flip it over it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a cool little design there's another
little design hidden under the main design
[SPEAKER_00]: also that you may not notice but then on
the back I feel like it's got my face on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and a website address I feel like
putting my face on there really puts a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of transparency to my brand that is me I'm
the guy to that brand you know who to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to when you email it you know when you
email my company you know who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to you know who the customer
service guy is you know who made the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: you know whose ideas these are you know
who you're representing and whose product
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top it says Iry genetics in the
middle it's got the strain on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got the website with my little face
logo on the bottom of the packaging so I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like we cover most of the important
aspects there on the outside we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: branding and we've got contact info and
we've got product information.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will put disclaimers of
some sort this is a novelty item souvenir
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes only it depends on where you're
shipping your product that is legal stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would consult your legal team with
I don't add that to my packages because
[SPEAKER_00]: many of my vendors will staple a card to
the package or a big order will get one
[SPEAKER_00]: card that says whatever it needs to say
depending on where it is going if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: novelty a souvenir a CBD a hemp item that
will be attached later on as necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where it's being distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I think about is
branding put your brand name on there this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the one off this is like your business
card this is the one opportunity people
[SPEAKER_00]: get to identify your brand associate it
with something in their head if you draw a
[SPEAKER_00]: dagger on it some people may not be into
that but the people that are into daggers
[SPEAKER_00]: are definitely going to remember it if you
put a lollipop on there some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: packages have really cool logos those
lollipop logo gets a lot of attention the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue raspberry truffle logo gets a lot of
attention orangegasm has a fancy logo it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets a lot of attention those packages get
noticed after many strains get success I
[SPEAKER_00]: will create a specific package for that
strain but most of my stuff comes in a
[SPEAKER_00]: generic package with I read genetics
premium seeds the cross logo you flip it
[SPEAKER_00]: over it's got the brand the strain name
and the website on the bottom keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: simple but give all of the pertinent
information that is needed then people can
[SPEAKER_00]: contact me from there kind of got rambly
forgot where I was going the next thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: should think about is protecting those
seeds what is inside that package is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part the branding is great
contact info is good having an identity on
[SPEAKER_00]: a table filled with seed packs and your
seed pack standing out that is really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: but are the seeds in there crushed because
they've got to get mailed handled and
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered so always put them inside of
some sort of protective packaging of some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort I buy bubble containers from a
company called LA containers dot com
[SPEAKER_00]: they're quite expensive I buy them by
three thousand at a time to be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: honest with you and it is quite expensive
shipping on those things is super
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive they ship from LA via UPS really
expensive that it that eats up a big cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of seed sales right there it's just the
packaging so I use the bubbles with the
[SPEAKER_00]: foam insert I open up the clamshell bubble
put the seeds in there put the foam insert
[SPEAKER_00]: over it and then I close it then that goes
inside of a three by three baggie with the
[SPEAKER_00]: folded card inside with all of the info
those all slide together then just for
[SPEAKER_00]: security purposes for safety for peace of
mind I like to heat seal most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: packages if you get them directly from me
they might not be heat sealed but if I
[SPEAKER_00]: send them to a vendor I try to make sure
they're heat sealed before they go out so
[SPEAKER_00]: they cannot be tampered with if they come
from me and they're not heat sealed they
[SPEAKER_00]: came straight from me bro the only person
that fucked with them was me and then if
[SPEAKER_00]: you plan on reselling them or something
just tell me got him straight from me it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be legit but yeah I seal most of
the packs that go out so they are in a
[SPEAKER_00]: protective bubble in a foam so they don't
rattle around too much in the packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and also so they don't go flying out when
you open that that gets put inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: baggie which has got a card folded inside
of it for all the info also that card
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps the light out now that the seeds are
protected from the light then that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: heat sealed then I bundle them in packs of
five they go into a container that is
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled properly that's how those go but
mainly think about branding put your brand
[SPEAKER_00]: name on there the strain name as much
strain info as you can and then some
[SPEAKER_00]: contact info I think my website info is
great so sometimes I do include a sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: on the inside with a link to my discord so
if people want to join the discord they
[SPEAKER_00]: can check that out as well but I try not
to put too many confusing things inside
[SPEAKER_00]: there now keep this in mind I do come from
the music industry so when you look at my
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging my packages are designed as
record labels if you look at an album like
[SPEAKER_00]: an album yeah guys we're going that old
people vinyls coming back back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: we had these big this is older than me
even but back in the day we had vinyls I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew up with CDs it's a square case with a
square design all the CD covers were a
[SPEAKER_00]: square I always wanted to be in a fucking
successful rock and roll band or some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: I had fun I did my thing but this is where
I'm supposed to be is in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry but I did tour with a lot of
bands I did a lot of work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: bands a lot of my art and design and
branding ideas come from the music
[SPEAKER_00]: industry so it's all about catching
somebody's eye and standing out and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of identifying your so in the music
industry if you're metal or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: hard rock stuff use skulls and like that
blood drip sort of fucking logo right we
[SPEAKER_00]: already know what that is if you use
certain kind of font we know that you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: rap group if you use a certain kind of
font we know that you're a pop group we've
[SPEAKER_00]: just identified certain things with
certain if you see the K you know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Kmart if you see that lady with their legs
behind her head you know that's Starbucks
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just certain things inside of our
brain they give us a certain idea I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned how to do that through branding
through bands with my seed company so I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned how to identify myself create a
vibe and stand out with my packaging so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a lot of that came from the music
industry is where I get a lot of that vibe
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of those ideas if you notice a lot
of my shit looks like a record label it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the band name the album name you flip
it over the songs are listed on the back
[SPEAKER_00]: here's our website that's a lot of how
albums do it that's kind of how I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it and then I found a really cool
artist shout out to my buddy Kevin who
[SPEAKER_00]: does great art for me also shout out to DP
710 but these guys do great art and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: put those on the packages that makes it a
lot of fun all right I've been rambling
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little bit here I did say I was
going to read a cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: question I do have one great question here
in front of me I said one great question I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do
this one came from our friend who calls
[SPEAKER_00]: himself used to be cool every time I read
that I say you're listening to the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: bro so you are still cool in my book don't
ever think you're not cool bro you're cool
[SPEAKER_00]: until you decide you're not cool anymore
it's just like getting old you're not old
[SPEAKER_00]: until you decide you are I'm rambling let
me stay focused a little bit this one says
[SPEAKER_00]: I had five plants in my four by four which
included two orange chasm plants all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them but one orange chasm finished between
55 and 60 days the remaining orange chasm
[SPEAKER_00]: appears to be within appeared to be within
10 days of finishing so to help it along I
[SPEAKER_00]: followed your pro tip about switching the
lights back to 18 six let me talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that because maybe people don't listen to
every episode I've talked about this in
[SPEAKER_00]: several episode this is a technique and a
method that I do use quite often when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering my plants at the end of flower
approximately 10 to 14 days before harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: around the same time that I begin to flush
I put my grow lights back on an 18 hour on
[SPEAKER_00]: and six hour off cycle my theory and what
I've proven by doing this several times is
[SPEAKER_00]: that my buds get chunkier they get more
dense and they finish up more quickly so
[SPEAKER_00]: that is why I'm doing this I'm turning my
lights to 18 six for a faster finish and a
[SPEAKER_00]: chunkier product now let's talk about what
our friend is doing and what has happened
[SPEAKER_00]: here I followed your advice and switch the
lights to 18 six I'm now on day 67 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining orange chasm still looks like
it's about 10 days from finishing I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure what to do if it doesn't finish
within the 14 days of the light switch can
[SPEAKER_00]: I go back to 12 12 if it's not done and
then okay I know I know where we are it
[SPEAKER_00]: says thanks for any advice you can offer
now this is a great question I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start off by I'm not gonna scold you but
I'm going to give you some constructive
[SPEAKER_00]: criticism that I keep saying when we talk
about the 18 six because I need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this piece of advice out and make it more
clear many people have taken to the 18 six
[SPEAKER_00]: idea at the end of flower it seems to be
successful for a lot of people one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make clear and reiterate and
remind you that I think is a better
[SPEAKER_00]: practice is to not do this the first time
you run a plant run the plant the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time find out how long that plant takes to
finish then do this the second time we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know how long that plants gonna go
our dude used to be cool here started too
[SPEAKER_00]: early now the plant is not done because he
didn't know the plant doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with this cultivar and now he's
got himself in a weird position and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure what to do so my very first piece
of advice is don't do this on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: run with a new plant run that plant once
run that plant maybe twice find out how
[SPEAKER_00]: long is ideal for that that plant to
finish that particular plant to finish up
[SPEAKER_00]: then do this technique the second time and
see if you can reduce the flowering time
[SPEAKER_00]: have some data to compare it to the first
time would be my suggestion now
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately we're past that we can't go
back in time we can't grow this one more
[SPEAKER_00]: time and then figure it out we've got to
work with what we've got so let's find a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution what I would do is keep going the
way that you are going keep going do not
[SPEAKER_00]: put it back to 12 12 you've already gone
from 18 6 to 12 12 back to 18 6 we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to confuse this plant anymore that's
when you may get seeds that's when you may
[SPEAKER_00]: get manners that's when you may get
problems that's when it just may
[SPEAKER_00]: completely fucking freak out ruin
everything so I would not go back I would
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going until the moment I see signs of
absolute revenge once you know what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure reveging on you that's when I
would cut down you should be flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: already so it's going to be ready to cut
whenever you're ready to cut it so as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see that revege cut but um it'll
take a little bit it's not going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to revege right away you've got a pretty
strong plant if it's still taking away if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still taking time to finish that
means it will take longer to revege as
[SPEAKER_00]: well that's just a commonality in the
genetics it takes longer to finish it will
[SPEAKER_00]: take longer to revege so that's a good
thing keep it going wait until you see
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of revege you've got more than the
14 days I say 10 to 14 because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal you won't see signs of revege until
at least 17 21 maybe 24 26 days pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the plant keep going and as
soon as you see that revege then cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down that's what I would do I would not do
the 12 12 it's had enough I said this
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's already stressed out it's
already had enough it will get confused
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll get pissed off I don't know what it
will do if you put it back under 12 12
[SPEAKER_00]: that really could freak that plant out so
I think the number one thing to take away
[SPEAKER_00]: from this and my dude I know it's already
too late we can't go back in time but the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one thing that I would take away
from this is do not do this with new cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't know how long they take to
finish because that is how you run into
[SPEAKER_00]: this exact situation to wrap it up I would
keep going until you see signs of revege
[SPEAKER_00]: revege will be little leaves poking out of
the top of the buds the bottom leaves will
[SPEAKER_00]: start curling up kind of weird I would
keep going until you see that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: already flushing so it'll be clean by the
time you cut it down as soon as you see
[SPEAKER_00]: that revege starting cut it down unless it
gets ready before that which it might
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another thing I wanted to touch on
since you're going at this light pace it
[SPEAKER_00]: is finishing more rapidly than you think
you're saying it appeared to be within 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days looks like it's still 10 days if it
doesn't finish within the 14 within the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few days this plant is going to show
a lot of progress it is getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: light it is going to progress much more
quickly than you're anticipating because
[SPEAKER_00]: it is at the end if it's not already
turning yellow the leaves are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: droopy that will happen very soon it will
begin to go into senescence and it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: done before too long just naturally
because the plant knows that it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: about time for that plant to be done so I
think you'll be alright and if not you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to cut down a plant that is a
little bit too early it's not quite done
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a learning lesson and if you
cut down orangegasm I think you'll still
[SPEAKER_00]: have if you cut down orangegasm too early
I think you'll still be happy you'll still
[SPEAKER_00]: have a satisfying outcome because it's
still gonna be a head ringer of a buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: that sativa buzz is really strong when he
cut it down early so even if it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit early you still may get a real head
ripping psychedelic sativa buzz out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that even though it didn't finish as long
as we could have let it go my dude used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cool it's been great hearing from you I
haven't gotten a message from you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: while hope everything is iry let me know
how things go let me know when you finally
[SPEAKER_00]: cut this plant down let me know how it
looked how it smoked how it tasted let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you got any revenge let me know I
want a feedback report thank you bro I do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that all right we've got one
more breeding question here this one came
[SPEAKER_00]: from our friend no need to give me a shout
out we know who I am so my dude thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: he wants to remain anonymous so we're
gonna quickly read this message and it
[SPEAKER_00]: says rasta Jeff you bad motherfucker I
hope all is well in your corner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world I'd like to start off by saying
thank you for providing high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: content practical and reliable advice and
at the best price the internet has to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer dude thank you that is a great way
to start a message I appreciate that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're welcome high quality content I
appreciate that that's a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: practical and reliable that's what it's
all about too many people on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: are giving crazy fucking advice keep it
simple stoner and then the best price yes
[SPEAKER_00]: the show is free I do appreciate it that
you notice that the show is free some
[SPEAKER_00]: people are bothered that I do ask for
patreon contributions but they're nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: forcing anybody and the people that do
contribute seem grateful so thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: that let's keep moving it says leading to
the question I found two plants that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: selected to breed for very different yet
specific reasons and then he talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants I don't think I'm gonna talk
too much about that he says one has
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral branches okay we can skip a lot of
this it says the second plant they talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the second plant now I know the
answer to this question is which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to skip over some of this I did
pre read this it goes on it says I know
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this was covered in a previous
episode but I cannot seem to find it but
[SPEAKER_00]: which of these plants should I reverse my
goal is basically to get buds and turps as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the shorter flowering time from
the tall skinny one and get the structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and vigor from the short one it seems
logical to reverse the taller one as it
[SPEAKER_00]: will seem it will have an easier time
pollinating the shorter plant more
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly that's a good logical approach
to that but I'm not sure the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go just because it seems to make sense to
me I attached picks it goes on to say I
[SPEAKER_00]: did attach picks I did look at the
pictures I'll have some feedback on that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know what your goal is I know what you're
going for I don't need to read the long
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions here you've got the right
idea I think you answered your own
[SPEAKER_00]: question with your own intuition you said
it seems logical to reverse the taller one
[SPEAKER_00]: something inside of you is saying to do
that and if you don't do that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to wonder what you would have
done if you what you would have done if
[SPEAKER_00]: you did that and didn't do the other thing
so my first advice is always follow your
[SPEAKER_00]: intuition if something inside of you says
to reverse that one as a breeder as a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant grower as the person in charge of
this product as the artist involved here
[SPEAKER_00]: do what your heart is telling you to do
what your intuition says when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding I often say learn about Mendel
charts learn about alial charts learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about dominant and recessive genes learn
about co-dominant genes learn about filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generations learn how to label things then
once you've got all that stuff figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about it and grow from your heart
and breed with love and use your intuition
[SPEAKER_00]: when you look at two plants in a grow room
something's gonna go man if that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant got together and made seeds and
made plants they would be amazing do that
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like you're on that path which is
the passion the desire the grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart the breed with love that's the most
important part of it then seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of it is the most fun if you are
making a project that is assigned by me
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an assignment that's work that's a
project that you're just doing do what you
[SPEAKER_00]: love to do do what at your heart is
calling for you to do and also my next
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of advice is do the other way also
because this isn't gonna be your last time
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding seeds your only time breeding do
them both and see what they both do then
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future breed them together that's I
know it sounds crazy it sounds like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: but as a breeder who's way ahead of you in
this breeding game who knows how this uh I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to say addiction but that's how
this addiction goes but that's how this
[SPEAKER_00]: passion goes you're gonna make some seeds
out of plant A to plant B and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them and you're gonna go hmm and
you're gonna do plant B to plant A and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna grow up and then you're gonna
see two plants and they're gonna go oh
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and then you're gonna cross those and
that one is gonna be your fucking the
[SPEAKER_00]: mastermind right there that's gonna be the
the ninja samurai warrior Yoda Buddha
[SPEAKER_00]: right there that you're looking for so my
first advice is use your intuition follow
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart do what your heart told you to
do if not that's almost a lot of things in
[SPEAKER_00]: life follow your heart use your intuition
because if you don't if there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to do and you don't do it
when you're too old to do it you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be like fuck I should have done that I'm
gonna I wish I would have done that like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna you're gonna really that's
when you have regrets is when you don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit that you thought you should do so
get that shit done do the one you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea for use that taller one as your first
pollinator then again the second time
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse that shit do the other one and let
that tall one receive pollen also it
[SPEAKER_00]: really depends on who and we don't know
this until we breed we don't know which
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has dominant and recessive and
co-dominant traits we don't know which
[SPEAKER_00]: traits are gonna take over the mix you've
never bred with either one of these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know what either one of them adds
so we don't know what to expect you could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly and this is just hypothetical you
could reverse plant A and pollinate plant
[SPEAKER_00]: B and the outcome could either be all
plant A or all plant B you could do the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite and both of those effects could
be the outcome or you could reverse plant
[SPEAKER_00]: A and pollinate plant B and it could be a
50-50 mix you could reverse plant B and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate A and it could be 70-30 on the
outcome on the phenotypes we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're offering it could be all
intersex plants they could be all intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do it one way and all solid fems if
you do it the other way so really we just
[SPEAKER_00]: have to breed with these plants is really
the only true way to find out you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed them make the crosses grow them take
a lot of notes and pay a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is where the passion comes from
that is what the passion is all about
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why we're growing from our heart
and breeding with love my dude who wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to remain anonymous I really hope I gave
you some useful advice my main piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: advice with this one is follow your
intuition do the thing that first inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: you to do this then you got the rest of
your life to do the rest of the projects I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended all right ladies and gentlemen
boys girls pimps hoes friends foes smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: growers clone cutters and Paul and
Chuckers all of you beautiful cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts out there I'm sure you can
hear my throat burning out so it is time
[SPEAKER_00]: to wrap up this episode if you have any
