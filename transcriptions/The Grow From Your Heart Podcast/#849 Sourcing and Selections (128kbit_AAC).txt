Of course, I do like to feature grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: or cannabis community pet peeves on the
podcast Of course, maybe you know what a
[SPEAKER_01]: pet peeve is a pet peeve is something that
just drives you crazy Maybe you go to your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends Grow you see something that just

see something in the grow room that just
[SPEAKER_01]: drives you crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you see it on the internet I
encourage people to send me their grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room pet peeves You can email those to me
at grow from your heart at hotmail.com If
[SPEAKER_01]: I read your grow room pet peeve here on
the podcast You will receive a coupon code
[SPEAKER_01]: for a free pack of seeds at iry direct.com
Today's grow room pet peeve came from my
[SPEAKER_01]: new friend who's going to be called traven
I think that's how I say that traven or
[SPEAKER_01]: traven Much respect, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know how to say your name,
but I'm glad you're a part of the army
[SPEAKER_01]: either way The pet peeve goes a little bit
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says hey Ross to Jeff I for sure have a
pet peeve that I think other growers can
[SPEAKER_01]: relate to and yes, bro I definitely
connected on this one made me chuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a conversation recently with a
friend about this I had a friend who
[SPEAKER_01]: bought a fat sack of good herb and they
were a victim of what you're about to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about Anyway, the question says I hate
seeing beautiful dense nugs with dog or
[SPEAKER_01]: cat hair all Over them pet hair is our
enemy as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Absolutely a friend of mine recently
bought some really good weed except about
[SPEAKER_01]: seven eighths of that weed is coated in
kitten hair So yes, that can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: ruin a good bag of good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all frosty green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got bright orange hairs It's covered
in trichomes and he turned that nugget
[SPEAKER_01]: over and there's a big sticky lump of cat
hair on there I've definitely taken great
[SPEAKER_01]: photos in my own garden been in there
super proud of the nugs I'm in there
[SPEAKER_01]: taking nug shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited I bring it to the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw the disk into the computer I load
the image up on the computer and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice nug shot with one fucking dog
hair right down the middle of it Been
[SPEAKER_01]: there so many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that I do not have a pet at this
time, but I do plan to acquire a new dog
[SPEAKER_01]: in the near future There are some steps in
front of that, but there will be a new dog
[SPEAKER_01]: when the new dog does come into the world
I will have to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to reconfigure the grow So
there's more filtration to make sure the
[SPEAKER_01]: dog hair does not make it to there also I
will have to change clothes more
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently when going in and out of The
grow space to avoid that dog hair from
[SPEAKER_01]: being moved into the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, my dude I'm just gonna call you
travin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna say that's how you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not that's how we say it today
my dude Thank you for the great pet peeve
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with you when you're
looking at a bud or a photo or any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: product and there's a dog or a cat hair in
it that is almost a heartbreaker It almost
[SPEAKER_01]: makes you want to cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so near perfection And then there's a
cat hair right in the middle of the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: who wants to smoke a bunch of cat hair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great pet peeve,

your grow question here on the show If I
[SPEAKER_01]: read that question here on the podcast I
will send you a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds at iry direct dot com
Today's question came from the grow help
[SPEAKER_01]: tab and it came from my new friend Doug
The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says what's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little question here I actually
found this to be a fun and intriguing and
[SPEAKER_01]: entertaining question and kind of an
exciting question for me to ask that
[SPEAKER_01]: always makes a big difference So not a
little question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a big one and I really like it
This is I just bought a tester pack and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious as to where your original
lineage comes from for your selections
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what beans or cuts are your go-to
when you were trying to find a new strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder that is a very fun question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very opening question.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gives me a lot of stuff to talk about
so basically this Person is asking how do
[SPEAKER_01]: I acquire new seeds or new clones or new
plants for my breeding projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do these plants come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I make the decisions where to get
them what to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very great great question as a
seed breeder as a seed maker as a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: lover This definitely opens me up to a lot
of conversation So where do my plants come
[SPEAKER_01]: from that I choose to breed with my clones
my seeds my cuttings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does all of this come from they come
from a plethora of different places and
[SPEAKER_01]: sources If you will, let's talk about I've
got a sort of a list here of things Let's
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one that I've got written down
is cherry paloma Cherry paloma was almost
[SPEAKER_01]: forced upon me when cherry paloma became
popular two different people sent me the
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry paloma cut They're like hey,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think you should breed with this
and you should work with this and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, ah, it seems okay I might work with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put one out in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't make it that plant got destroyed
that greenhouse got hit by a storm That
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry paloma plant was murdered out there
I thought it was gone and then guess what
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else is like, hey Do you have the
cherry paloma and I was like no and they
[SPEAKER_01]: sent it to me and then another friend of
mine in my close breeding circle In my
[SPEAKER_01]: group came to me one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my hands on this JR's cut of cherry
paloma So it felt like cherry paloma was
[SPEAKER_01]: almost forced upon me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the universe the weed world I
listened also the world was like take this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant do something great with this and I
did I've done a couple of great things
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cherry paloma We made the cherry
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also crossed it to the BC lemon skunk
I will talk about those in the near
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe those will be on the testing the
testing table soon, but That is where the
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry paloma came from Three different
people mailed me cuts of the cherry paloma
[SPEAKER_01]: and then somebody else a different source
actually mailed one of my very best
[SPEAKER_01]: friends Another cut of the cherry paloma
So over time I had four different cuts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the same plant arrive at my growing areas
and it was like a sign It was a sign from
[SPEAKER_01]: the weed gods or whatever god you believe
in it was a sign as said hey Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cherry paloma is a fun one to start
with I get a lot of cuts from my friends
[SPEAKER_01]: Locally and not so locally and also I work
or worked in commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities where I would see a lot of
great cuts One good thing about working in
[SPEAKER_01]: a commercial grow no offense to you guys
work in there But those guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: overworked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's two or three dudes
running a giant warehouse They're
[SPEAKER_01]: overworked the plants get overlooked
sometimes if they're focused on room a
[SPEAKER_01]: room B may not even get Touched all day
some of the plants get slightly abused
[SPEAKER_01]: They get beat up in there and I get to go
to that facility and see which plants
[SPEAKER_01]: handled the stress Which plants are not
getting the pest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the whole room got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one section that didn't get it I'm
gonna keep my eye on that plant try to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember these don't get spider mites
Those might go into my breeding projects
[SPEAKER_01]: later But I pay attention in the
commercial facility watching these young
[SPEAKER_01]: dudes Fuck these plants up for nine weeks
and then I get to see at the end of that
[SPEAKER_01]: nine week abuse what comes out real well
and how Things react to that abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they accidentally get
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they accidentally get
underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they get bugs Sometimes it gets
too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it gets too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes everything goes freaking
perfectly I get to see how these plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: large numbers react in that sort of
environment with those sort of conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: and so in multiple cases in multiple
occasions I've acquired cuts from those
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facilities to add to my
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've written down a couple of those the
platinum tangy and the Strawberry fields
[SPEAKER_01]: cut that I have both came from a
commercial cultivation facility in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: West, Colorado The platinum tangy was just
a great cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hyper vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew very quickly It could handle a lot
of problems We had one room with an air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioner intake that in the winter a
lot of cool air would come in there It
[SPEAKER_01]: would mess up a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew if I put that platinum tangy up
against that section, there'd be just fine
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants were super resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They handled all of the stress So when it
was time, I acquired a cut of that
[SPEAKER_01]: platinum tangy Also that strawberry fields
that I got came from the same commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility I watched that plant tolerate all
types of abuse and bang out gigantic
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry candy flavored buds with high
potency all day long I had to get a cut of
[SPEAKER_01]: that the platinum tangy made It made
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also made sun kiss It's made other
things the strawberry starburst cut ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up or the strawberry fields cut made
strawberry starburst Raphael Probably
[SPEAKER_01]: other things that I can't think of off
that the red pill came from that one So
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where that one came from Another
popular cut that I work with a lot is the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I get the golden goat?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the golden goat since probably
2008 or nine 2010 at the latest I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: say it's in circa 2009 I guess is kind of
where I think it fell in but There was a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary up north that sold golden goat
flowers all the time and the flowers were
[SPEAKER_01]: always fire super good Weed it was super
potent It always tastes real nice I just
[SPEAKER_01]: loved the flavor and the buzz of the
golden goat one day a friend of mine came
[SPEAKER_01]: to me We're gonna call him Pineapple
Express.
[SPEAKER_01]: He happened to be from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good grower really good friend
pineapple I hope you're well my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he came to me He said hey,
do you know this one guy in our group?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yeah, I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he likes me and he goes Oh,
no, he fucking hates you for some reason
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's a totally different story It
doesn't matter why I don't even care why
[SPEAKER_01]: that guy didn't like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold weed at the time He sold weed at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had all the good customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like me He gave my buddy
Pineapple Express a cut of golden goat and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's like I will give you this golden goat
as long as you don't give it to Jeff You
[SPEAKER_01]: know how things go on this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy was like sure thing we'll do that
and he took the cut Guess what did drove
[SPEAKER_01]: it straight to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I acquired the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of a There was multiple
reasons there First of all that dude was a
[SPEAKER_01]: dick and said don't give it to me and my
buddy was like haha And he brought it to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just kind of a spite move also my
buddy Knew that I was a good grower one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the the known growers in town somebody
that should have that good cut I got it
[SPEAKER_01]: and I grew it a few times and I realized
that golden goat was special and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why I got into my breeding project a Lot
of people in other places were like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not fair that you've got that golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got cancer I've got other problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'd love to have that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be medicinal for me So that
inspired me to make it into fem seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: ship it everywhere So that's how golden
goat fem seeds got made and put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where are we now the medusa?
[SPEAKER_01]: many of you don't even know about Medusa
what the heck is medusa medusa is a
[SPEAKER_01]: 16-week flowering sativa that will knock
your socks off It doesn't make me high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make me stoned It makes me felt
bent or crooked or it makes me feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: did different drugs It's I don't know it
does weird shit to my brain It's pleasant
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can be a lot sometimes if you're a
smoker that really wants to go to another
[SPEAKER_01]: planet and try something new Medusa will
get you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, I have crossed the medusa to
The afterglow I made feminized seeds and I
[SPEAKER_01]: call that wingsuit I call it wingsuit
because when you smoke it It's like you
[SPEAKER_01]: just jumped off the fucking roof of a
building and you spread your wings and you
[SPEAKER_01]: were hoping for the fucking best That's
what it's like when you smoke this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll sit at the chair and wonder about
life and your heart will just race and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be sweaty You'll burn calories by
smoking this weed just chilling out So the
[SPEAKER_01]: wingsuit takes about 14 weeks to flower
medusa is like 16 17 weeks that cut came
[SPEAKER_01]: from a friend of mine who wants nothing To
do with the weed world.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to grow and breed good cannabis
and that's what he wants to do That's his
[SPEAKER_01]: contribution to the weed world as he gives
us good plants to play with He doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want any spotlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what he's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a businessman He's a family man in
other realms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He uh, he hides in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was he's like Bane of the weed world
He's born in the shadows, but that dude
[SPEAKER_01]: breeds some amazing stuff and he gave me a
cut of the medusa He's a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also shout out, but I hope you see this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know who you are You don't even
need to say your name He gave me the
[SPEAKER_01]: medusa cut and I breed with that because
um, it adds diversity to my breeding mix
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my stuff is sativa dominant candy
flavored, but the medusa has got a really
[SPEAKER_01]: unique sort of a buzz to it Um,
it's a different sort of a buzz than what
[SPEAKER_01]: comes with most of my lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more paranoia inducing It's I I can't
even explain it properly most of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm high or i'm stoned and this one is I'm
bent and crooked and I don't know i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to park my car in motorcycle spaces
and Losing my sunglasses while i'm wearing
[SPEAKER_01]: them and shit like that Uh that but that
that my friends is the wingsuit and the
[SPEAKER_01]: medusa i'm gonna keep going i'm gonna try
to stay focused Obviously i've been taking
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of dabs today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one to talk about is the cream
Where does my cream breeder cut come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy random, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred the cream seeds I've been making
cream seeds for quite a while That is the
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies and cream number 13 to arise I
named it the cream because the cream rises
[SPEAKER_01]: to the top cookies and cream arise cream
rising the cream bro So i've got the name
[SPEAKER_01]: the cream is an amazing Plant i've seen
uh, so many people send me amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chunky It grows very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got amazing flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buzz is very desirable Recently,
I gave a friend some seeds of the cream
[SPEAKER_01]: and many other seeds And he ran them in
his grow locally in my neighborhood right
[SPEAKER_01]: down the street I pointed right there like
you guys knew where his house was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you don't but My dude grew a bunch
of seeds for me locally right down the
[SPEAKER_01]: street I got to go over there every three
or four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go there and smoke and hang out and
look at his plants and Check on him and
[SPEAKER_01]: see how the day was going just kill some
time over there and stare into the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hank hill and fucking dale gribble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just stare at him But we found he found
he grew a cut of the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew a seed of the cream That was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a clone also It's backed up in
two spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's his cut but he was nice enough
to give me a clone of the cream I promised
[SPEAKER_01]: him when I breed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll get some seeds back from it,
but I have got a Cut of the cream that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from a local friend that is
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be in my breeding rotation very
soon You'll see it as a pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it as a pollen receiver The new
cream cut that we recently found is I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to say hot fire, but it's frosty cool This
one is frosty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure is real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The color is beautiful The turps are
mostly there, but the turps are not
[SPEAKER_01]: overpowering to where I think so what's
real?
[SPEAKER_01]: What it's all it's really missing is
powerful turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells Good, but it's not like she bow
I think when I breed that to some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: more flavorful females that will leave
room For that structure that vigor that
[SPEAKER_01]: potency that trichome content the leaf
color Then we're gonna get flavor from
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody else is what I'm really hoping
for So we'll leave some room for those
[SPEAKER_01]: ladies to do some work in the breeding
project But that's where the cream came
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have more on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got AJ sour diesel I've got AJ sour
diesel AJ's cut I've got a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel cuts, but right now we're
gonna focus on the AJ sour and kosher
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I get AJ sour and kosher Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking those strains for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are awesome I honestly got them from
reputable clone vendors in the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: area I knew people back in the day that
sold clones that give you a menu They'd
[SPEAKER_01]: say we got these the clones are somewhere
between ten and ten thousand dollars a cut
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what you want to buy Pick
what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll send you a total.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring you the clones on Monday That
is where the AJ sour and the kosher Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: came from Amazing cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those you will see those in the
breeding very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of avenues and ways
that I acquire clones also I buy seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: clones off of websites just like normal
civilians I'm not afraid to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: website and if I heard about something
that I want and it gets my attention I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: go find it on the internet and buy it just
like a normal customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a civilian I'm a shopper just like you
guys I like to go buy new shit and add it
[SPEAKER_01]: to my repertoire, but also People love to
send me random seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it It's a box that sits on my
table It is a small lunchbox just filled
[SPEAKER_01]: with seeds that people have given me that
I do want to grow eventually But I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: so many seeds that it's not possible
within my lifetime to grow out all these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds But people love to send me seeds and
they love to send me clones Like I said
[SPEAKER_01]: that cherry paloma just kept popping up
couldn't get rid of the cherry paloma So I
[SPEAKER_01]: did take the hint ladies and gentlemen,
I did listen to the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did breathe With that I made some great
shit with the cherry paloma If you bred
[SPEAKER_01]: with cherry paloma, are you seeing a
couple of mutants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing weird offspring in anything
that came from the cherry paloma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just curious Let's talk as breeder friends
post your pictures send them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think So where was I
I buy and trade seeds and shit also If
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got some cool seeds and I may be
interested in them and I've got some cool
[SPEAKER_01]: shit I'm open to trade sometimes don't be
offended if I don't want your stuff But
[SPEAKER_01]: there is some stuff that's hard to find
that I was looking for and I also will
[SPEAKER_01]: trade clones if it It's the right clone my
inbox is gonna fucking blow up because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and in the future I do intend to sell
a few clones on I redirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be selling a few clones Very minimal
clones at premium prices because it'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: just me handling everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to sell clones before with help I
did not like the way it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will Cut the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will package the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will ship the clone It will all be me so
that when there's a complaint,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fucking on me last time I had a
helper didn't go the way we hoped for I
[SPEAKER_01]: apologize Now I'm talking in the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy seeds off the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy clones off the internet I buy clones
for sometimes from dispensaries if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere Sometimes a friend of mine will
just give me a really killer cut as a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder something I appreciate and enjoy
if you grow a pack of my seeds and you
[SPEAKER_01]: find a really killer cut I would love it
If you contact me and maybe help me
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire that cut from you and I would make
it worth it I would send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would promise you seeds in the future
Yeah, that that sort of stuff does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I put your name on that cut
If you want your name on that cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll notice there is the afterglow
painted lady cut The way that that worked
[SPEAKER_01]: was I sent painted lady some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: She grew the afterglow She found a fucking
stellar cut one better than what I found
[SPEAKER_01]: and she sent me a cut of that I named it
the painted lady cut it says painted lady
[SPEAKER_01]: right on the package She gets a shout out
every time I talk about that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the painted lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're well Also, if you need some
beans, let me know because I've made you
[SPEAKER_01]: promises.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you more beans I made a lot of
afterglow crosses with the painted lady
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut so if you want something reach out,
I'll get them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen you grow much lately,
but I hope you're well Alright,
[SPEAKER_01]: ladies and gentlemen, I am freaking
rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far have we been going?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about 20 minutes in with some edits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we do have time for another
question But before we go that far,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send my buddy Doug a big thank
you Doug I hope I rambled on and explained
[SPEAKER_01]: how I got my cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how I find seeds and cuts I am
just places where they are people send
[SPEAKER_01]: them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy them on the internet just like a
shopper Luckily, I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know clone very well Vendors sometimes
people send me a text message with like
[SPEAKER_01]: just ten things on there Like I got these
you interested and I'll say sure I want
[SPEAKER_01]: this one and this one and then suddenly
those clones just appear How do I choose
[SPEAKER_01]: to breed with them is a totally different
story I need to run those in my
[SPEAKER_01]: environment before I'm gonna choose to
breed with them 99% of the time Sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: like the the strawberry and the platinum
tangy I grew that so many times that I
[SPEAKER_01]: just brought it home and we fucked with
that right away But most of the time it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to the personal grow I grow it out a
couple of times see what it does Then I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: spread it around to the homies and we'll
put it in some breeding tents But I think
[SPEAKER_01]: I answered that one quite in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my buddy Doug, thank you for the great
question I say your name at the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: the show or at the start of the message
anyhow, but anyway my dude, Doug Thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: for the great question Once again,
do check your inbox and your spam because
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a coupon code for a free pack
of seeds from Iri Direct calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we're gonna keep this great
momentum going I do have another question
[SPEAKER_01]: here in front of me This one also came
from that grow help tab on Iri genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: calm this one came from our friend Zainy
in Michigan shout out to my new friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Zainy in Michigan also Big shout out to
all the growers out there in Michigan
[SPEAKER_01]: killing it holding it down keeping it real
I hope all of your gardens come out very
[SPEAKER_01]: well this season the question says hey
Rasta Jeff Is it wise to do a few fino
[SPEAKER_01]: hunts of different crosses all in the same
room?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming you've got multiple packs
of seeds and you want to run multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: packs and see if you can find a good Fino
out of all of those Packs or maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: population of each pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe three of this one three of this one
three of this one I understand what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think here is it wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I advise this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I absolutely do That way you get to
see how all those different plants react
[SPEAKER_01]: to that room Not only do you get to see
how plant a reacts to that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could see if maybe plant B acts
differently in the room if plant C reacts
[SPEAKER_01]: differently in the room that will help you
find not only the phenotype that you are
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping to find to smoke and consume but
the one That works the best in your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps one of these strains We're just
gonna go very basic one's an indica one's
[SPEAKER_01]: a sativa one's a fucking hybrid Maybe
you'll find that one of those works way
[SPEAKER_01]: better in that grow environment So not
only are you Fino hunting for the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that you wish to consume and smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: But also you are Fino hunting to see which
plants work best in that environment There
[SPEAKER_01]: are pros and cons to running a mono crop
Which means just putting one pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room and doing a Fino hunt from
that whole pack there but I do Like seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the diversity of the different packs of
seeds in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll show you a lot of different things
And like I said before now you're not just
[SPEAKER_01]: picking that one plant that works You're
gonna find a lot of different options.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find that one gem that works the
best in that room Don't fall in love with
[SPEAKER_01]: any plants before you've smoked
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fall in love with anything too early
Give every plant in there an equal chance
[SPEAKER_01]: because some of those ugly plants some of
those slower plants Those oftentimes turn
[SPEAKER_01]: out to be the beauties so give everybody A
fair chance in this run.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what grows the best smokes the best
and suits the needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing for a Personal consumption
reason is it medical or recreational?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing for somebody else's
medical needs or are you growing simply?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a profit find the one that fits your
your needs fits your niche fills your
[SPEAKER_01]: demands That's the phenotype which you are
looking for So now briefly let me jump
[SPEAKER_01]: into what I kind of just brought my mind
to there are pros and cons to running
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple packs of seeds If you're just
running that one pack of seeds you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger population.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find you're going to find
different phenotypes You're gonna find
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like opening up more baseball cards
You got that more of a chance of finding
[SPEAKER_01]: that that rookie card of the popular
player for today I have no idea who the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck plays baseball today you guys but
it's like finding that Mickey Mantle
[SPEAKER_01]: baseball card there the more cards you
open the more chances you have for that
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey if you're running 10 seeds of
something you got a 1 in 10 chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: finding that super gem you're looking for
if you're On a hundred seeds you got that
[SPEAKER_01]: one in a hundred if you only run three
seeds of something you're diminishing your
[SPEAKER_01]: chances of finding that phenotype However,
then then my brain does this also does
[SPEAKER_01]: this argument?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many seeds do you need to run out of a
pack of seeds to find a keeper in my fem
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's six of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you run three to six, I really think
you'll find a keeper So I think your
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers are gonna be okay if you do at
least three of each thing and this phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt I'm rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pros and cons to this like I
said before if you run a whole pack Of
[SPEAKER_01]: something and fill the tent with one thing
You got a much more a much more a broader
[SPEAKER_01]: view of what those genetics have to offer
You may find something more special in
[SPEAKER_01]: there But if you want a phenol hunt
multiple things You will see what your
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are doing your environment is
doing what your skills and work are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: to multiple different plants You may learn
things that way you'll see that some
[SPEAKER_01]: things do work Like we said before indica
sativa hybrid You'll see that some things
[SPEAKER_01]: work well for this plant that don't work
on this plant and this plant tolerate some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that These don't this one really like
something you'll see the diversity in that
[SPEAKER_01]: population and how they all respond to
different treatment All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really got me rambling on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is super good.
