[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 494 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me is my
buddy, Doubledore Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not ask if you want me to use your
real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I call you by your real name or do
you want to be Doubledore today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call me Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is Matt joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being here, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, for a long time when we first
met, I only knew you as Doubledore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you said, this is Matt,
I was like, who the fuck is Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a couple, I was like,
I don't know anybody's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, I know Doubledore Dank, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my buddy over there on the south
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I started having fun with it
because you didn't know my email either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I really threw you for a loop
because I was like, oh, watch this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to email him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I left my name off of that and he used
it in a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was the guy who didn't put his name
because I'm tripping Ross to Jeff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we go to any event,
I'm going to recommend this for the Indo
[SPEAKER_00]: Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it'll take way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything where we're going to interact a
lot, I think we should all have name tags
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm a stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that's going to be my first
excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a brain injury and I meet a lot
of people and it's hard to remember
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I got to remember your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bell goes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That primal memory thing happens where I
know your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you are, but then I've got to
find all of your labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to just have to remember,
there's my friend, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I've got to go, Matt Doubledore
Dank, also known as whateverwhatever at
[SPEAKER_00]: gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the owner of this company,
also the guy that does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to run through this encyclopedia
of things about people now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's almost gotten to like where you
have a login and password for every
[SPEAKER_02]: freaking thing in this life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to remember the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pull out your phone and like
do some facial recognition just to get
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's memory called back into your
memory now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can barely do that, much less
remember everybody's Instagram and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to call you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I catch myself doing the
Hollywood smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because that's general.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can mean a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like how you've been is not,
you know, something that anybody wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hey, how you've been?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smile and let them proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell me what they want or what
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really recognizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks to pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fucking knees, almost the calves these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big cheesy smile and I'm behind
the booth with my brand name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody knows who that guy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll remember your faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But God, putting Matt and Double Door or
Jim and at GoodWeed.net together,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's become such a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the weed world, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a stony, rambling show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're off to some good chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hanging out for a little bit,
having some nice chats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a good time, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the best things going to
the events and just standing there at your
[SPEAKER_02]: table and watching people just meet you
for the first time and not realizing how
[SPEAKER_02]: freaking big you are, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, even if somebody thought
they hated you online, no, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be the happiest dude to see that person
when you see how big Ross did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget sometimes that I am six foot
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, they hear the number
and they go, sure, he's tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then some people, it's usually guys
that are not six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at you and go, oh, fuck,
you're tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten percent of the people, the first thing
they say when they meet me is,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit, you're tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another ten percent of the people,
the first thing they say is, damn,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dreads are long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try not to be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to come off as peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm kind of a tall, memorable
folk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also it's just funny watching
people look up at you, too, when they walk
[SPEAKER_02]: up to the booth and just.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm totally not sure if I should bend
down, if I should just stay up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's awkward, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, dude, you do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living the dream, having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep talking about the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see all of my friends at the
Endo Expo January 25th and 26th in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is at the Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's like 58th in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday is open to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday is business to business day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to come on Sunday,
but I do encourage you to get your tickets
[SPEAKER_00]: and your travel arrangements made now
because the event will sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people from around the world come to
this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the world's largest indoor
cultivation expos that you will ever find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, there are a lot of people
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to hit this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at booth 533.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one more ad, then we'll get moving
into the real part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is brought to you by our
friends at SeedsHereNow.
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new, regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds Here Now is the place for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show where it gets
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the stuff we've
been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doubledore over here showed up with some
jars of some double door dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, let's talk about what you brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in the little jar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that one's kind of rare,
you only got a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some cookies and cream in this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite Fino's as far as
frost and just average cookie cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is one of the harder hitting,
more OG style, more gassy leaning than
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the cookie crosses where you get
that really doughy flavor and kind of more
[SPEAKER_02]: subtle effects from some of the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream has more of the OG, will knock
you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kept it around in my garden for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cookies and cream, not the
cream, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually the parent to the
cookies and cream cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mommy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one of my favorites to grow,
but the bud from it is worth having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that such a gamble, a compromise you
have to make as a grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, man, this tastes so good and
the buzz is so amazing, but I'm only going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get three quarters of what I would get
from this other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to make this choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to grow more or do I want really
good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like myself, you'd say,
I'm going to go for the really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just maybe not smoke that extra
fourth bowl every day and I'll grow this
[SPEAKER_00]: really dank shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm one of those connoisseurs
where I appreciate the way bud looks and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm mostly a flower smoker and that's
because I enjoy, you know, I'm also a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower and with tabs and concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get a chance to really see what
the strain has to offer density wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I'd want to put it in my
garden and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always keep flower and if it's a
really good strain, I'm definitely keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about your grow and
your grow style here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely very visually appealing buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your buds have great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very well trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say that earlier when I was
looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone stays up all night trimming,
I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Pepper caffeine pushing me through
the nights, but it's worth it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you can tell when somebody
spent a lot of love and time on a product
[SPEAKER_02]: just because, you know, you see sloppy
work and you're just like a little let
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can absolutely tell the difference
between that's connoisseur bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is grade a connoisseur top shelf bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a dispensary weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not machine trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell there was some love and I'm not
just kissing your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You encouraged me to break it up so that I
could smell the inner aromas and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about the smell of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on and talk about this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about the cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this other jar you brought?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is motor breath across to now and
later, both of which are strains that are
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty popular here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now and later has more of the fruity gas
and motor breath is pretty much straight
[SPEAKER_02]: gas SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a heavy OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of the best of both worlds
because it's what I look for in bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not only is it good for me,
I've had a few friends who have medical
[SPEAKER_02]: issues who've tried it out and it's
actually a pretty successful one for a few
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the heavy eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I dab, I feel like I get bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, I'm high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoked some of this, I've called it
Mendo later or now in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just created a fun name.
[SPEAKER_00]: For it in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I smoked that, my eyes got
droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got settled down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got stoned instead of being super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit made me stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was getting at is you handed me a
bud and you encouraged me to break it open
[SPEAKER_00]: because you wanted me to smell it so that
I could describe the smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very unique smell aroma coming
from the now and later Mendo breath cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I described it as several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very dominant white grape peach
juice sort of a thing, but then in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background there's something earthy and
harsh, but in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying like harsh in a bad way,
but whatever it is itself is not something
[SPEAKER_00]: you would think is pleasant to eat or
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like leather or maybe beef jerky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say maybe peach grape beef
jerky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what's funny is I've let
quite a few different people smell this
[SPEAKER_02]: and ask them because I wasn't too sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to put your finger on what
this Vino smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very intoxicating smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to stop smelling it,
but you can't figure out what it is that
[SPEAKER_02]: you are smelling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep going back to the jar going,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I described it almost as if I had grapes
and berries in a tool belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a nice mix and the leathery is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard burnt rubber as well,
a little on the gassy side, but grapefruit
[SPEAKER_02]: in there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the combination is I guess an old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grapefruit and leather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pictured this old man just carving a
stick on his porch or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, you cured it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the things I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I broke it open, not only did I get
those leather and grape aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got the proper sponginess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not wet, but it's spongy still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the Colorado crunch,
which I complain about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was impressed by your cure work,
which shows that also you're really paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to details there when it comes
to growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did you trim the shit out of it,
did you wet or dry trim that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, team dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the big boys are dry trim and I get a
lot of questions if I prefer wet or dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I absolutely prefer a dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you do wet trim, I think it
releases a lot of the chlorophyll flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: into that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're making more cuts in the
leaves and more opportunities for that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture to open up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that may not be 100% true,
but when I was a younger girl,
[SPEAKER_02]: it seemed the case that if I tried to wet
trim, the flavor and stuff wasn't as good
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas now I do a very controlled curing
process where the humidity and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: is monitored much closer, and I do jar
cure everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of on a smaller batch,
so it's really easy to do the jar cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the size jar you cured it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a pint or a quart?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the bigger mason jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm looking for the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not printed on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of the bigger mason jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not giant, but like a big spaghetti jar,
big spaghetti sauce jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an almost baller jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good size jar of weed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice jar to carry around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was mainly excited to bring some by to
smoke with you because this is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: harvests that kind of everything goes
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think a lot of people realize
not every round goes right when you get
[SPEAKER_02]: really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a miracle that we got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between that quality and
middle shelf dispensary quality is two
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One mistake you can kind of, oh,
I hope I can rescue this and keep it top
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two mistakes or one thing you're not
paying attention to properly would bring
[SPEAKER_00]: that down such major quality difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get these plants for about 120,
150 days, depending on how your cycles go,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 90 days for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make every day count.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 150 opportunities to either degrade
the quality or improve the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you grow a hundred days,
think you got a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you put in a hundred percent today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you only put in 99% now your
plant, you've only got 99% total potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you grow in soil too, you know,
it takes longer to notice deficiencies and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you may have cost yourself
two weeks worth of, you know, damage to
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant to recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you're already in flower,
you know, you're setting yourself back in
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're going to yield, what your full
returns are going to be at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're doing what I call the chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to chase that, whatever nutrient
that is, you got to follow your feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to chase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to catch that up before you can
even get the plant back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then you're screwed by the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to catch up with a plant
that's in flower because then you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to overfeed it and you're going to burn
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to redo all the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, how long have you been growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many crops do you have under your
belt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this is good looking herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I guess allegedly since I was 16,
if you ask some of my, how old are you
[SPEAKER_00]: now, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess about 25 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: 29.
[SPEAKER_00]: 29.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking good for your old age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, um, as far as
professionally, you know, I've been in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado for three years now, uh,
growing new facilities, uh, with some
[SPEAKER_02]: great people, great growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make a Colorado joke here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been in Colorado for about three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you've probably worked in 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, actually, uh, it's just a Colorado
joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our Colorado friends are going,
yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds about fucking right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, you know, it was one
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed, um, changed management a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, other than that, I stuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I enjoyed it and they were great
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of our friends in other States,
it's a new industry and, um, lead growers
[SPEAKER_00]: only last about a year in a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get going, once you get
comfortable, something just goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lead grower, a management,
uh, an investor, staff, HR, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody goes, Hey, it's been a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: New lead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels like that's how it happens
in this industry a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of over a lot of turnover,
a lot of management changes, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: standard standard operating procedure
changes overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new blossoming industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there's a lot of
opportunities even outside of our state
[SPEAKER_02]: opening up with Oklahoma becoming legal
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even the companies here you see
expanding and, you know, going new places
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I love seeing my friends that
started stuff here that have been here
[SPEAKER_00]: since the beginning of medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see them pop up in places like
Massachusetts and Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, look, I'm killing it out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing the people that have some
clout, that know what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that understand not just the industry,
but the plant and the patients and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the aspects of making it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know how to set up a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people can set up a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people can set up some sort of
extraction lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of them can't do all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they end up messing up either the
business end, the tax end, the rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere they miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really proud of my friends that get
it all together because that's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to talk about your style of
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to your spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your very unique grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a cool style.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what I call kind of a coliseum grow
and you called it a vertical grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to explain to my listeners
what is happening in your grow room and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe tell us how you got the idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay on the mic for this part because they
want to hear all the details for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vertical like growing is not to be
confused with vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are talking about vertical
growing where they'll stack, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: veg trays on top of, you know,
different racks and do vertical that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking vertical light growing,
which is a tube style HPS in the center of
[SPEAKER_02]: a room with plants stacked in a circle
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of most of our traditional
light reflectors, the bulb would hang
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've basically taken the light bulb out
of a reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reflector around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're just hanging that bulb,
the bulb from the ceiling, essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's hanging vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bulb is long way looking like a big
teardrop or a big raindrop hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically right in the center of the room,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, luckily I found a type of HPS
light that offered a tube for air ducting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, so instead of the
traditional square bottom on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it had a tube already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just remove the shield from around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I removed the shield, you know,
I noticed, you know, it's a perfect tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use this for vertical light growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, this will be something fun that
I've, you know, never played with before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give it a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea behind it is really that you
get 360 degrees for your light bulb of
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not reflecting half of your bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my light energy doesn't have to go up
and hit my reflector and then come down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming off of the bulb to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you said that you've got the
plants 360 around the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys imagine you've got a bulb
hanging from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it's a campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine all the plants hanging out around
the campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called it a Colosseum grow because
it's just like, imagine you got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people in a Colosseum and the bulb is in
the center and it creates a really unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What gave you this idea, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it something you thought of or was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen things in the past where people
will show me, you know, experimental stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like, Hey, this, you know,
one company tried these grow dam blocks
[SPEAKER_02]: and this, you know, circular thing around
HBS and, you know, I've seen those Ferris
[SPEAKER_00]: wheel or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gravitron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got it, you know, doing a
rotation thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, um, I've always grown
traditionally, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I had a chance to, you know,
do something kind of different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know, I want to do
some experimenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took this concept that I saw in these
pictures and basically just wanted to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it my own, you know, uh, okay,
I'm going to figure out a style using this
[SPEAKER_02]: method that's going to work for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so I had a 10 by 10, um,
Colorado, you're limited to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: six plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it, the beauty of this is you can
actually bed your plants to be monsters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of having a bunch of small plants,
what I wanted to do was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: stick to completely legal, you know,
I want to keep the, you know, the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my numbers, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't get rated or, you know,
they say how many we can have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't say how big they can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, um, I kind of took that as
well, you know, they don't want me to have
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just make some monsters instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, a lot of people told me who saw
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, you know, it looks like you're
growing outdoor, indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of what those plants,
I saw them, I saw them, uh, right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of flower and kind of mid flower,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did, they have that outdoor plant
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, what I found was as the plants
are around this light, it gives you a 45
[SPEAKER_02]: degree kind of angle that you're getting
onto your lowers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you can actually, you can
actually get more density on all of your
[SPEAKER_02]: lower stuff and leave some of that to
become tops on the inner side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I don't have to have my light
reflecting off of a reflector and then
[SPEAKER_00]: coming down, uh, and also I've got the
bulb facing the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking I can get more,
you got more growth out of your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to lollipop and pinch
and prune so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light penetration at an angle,
instead of being straight above your
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy where your leaves are flat,
um, actually offers you more light
[SPEAKER_02]: penetration throughout the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I got was density, dense,
thick nugs all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you increase your overall harvest
weight from your traditional style of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, um, I did the same number
of plants in a couple of tents a while
[SPEAKER_02]: back and I added an extra six ounces to
what I harvested from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can use an extra six ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said extra six ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, anybody else got extra six
ounces?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of a weird thing to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not some crazy number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado problems, but extra six ounces
under one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's that we'll all take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, um, it also allows you to
still get dense, big nugs on your lowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also reduce the chance of you getting
bud rot because you know, you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, if you focus too much of your upper
growth, a lot of times with a dense nugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to be throwing out,
you know, maybe a third of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize that people always
want to see big giant buds, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that when you have giant buds,
there's that risk of bud rot right up the
[SPEAKER_00]: center of it, especially in Colorado when
we've got these crazy temperature swings,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity swings and spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in large environments where we
have less airflow and less control,
[SPEAKER_00]: we create micro climates and some of our a
hundred, you got a hundred lights in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 10 by 10 sections, a different kind
of climate if you don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get some bud rot going in there
with those big old buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is it, it's a way that you can
reduce the chance, you know, if you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't, if you know that strain in
particular gets bud rot or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: develops coals that are going to be huge,
you know, you can leave on more of the
[SPEAKER_02]: lowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll reduce some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to get the density in
those lowers because of the angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a neat little trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what size pots were you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did five gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd honestly recommend if you're going
to vet your plants out to be like six foot
[SPEAKER_02]: monsters, probably go into seven or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sevens for something like that
would have been ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a seven would have made them much
happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you got to live and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a struggle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have a trellis in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had sticks holding them up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a struggle to get in there and work
in that room once it started going?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually because of them being in a
circle, it allows me to walk on the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the plants, which makes
watering super easy and they grow inwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they do is they all lean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives you plenty of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you plenty of walking space
around them on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets even more stadium-like as it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all start leaning inward toward the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do much defoliation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you normally do much defoliation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I normally do quite a bit of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us commercial growers in Colorado
have been trained kind of to just get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and make them naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strip them down, you know, day 25 or so,
day 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you notice that standard schedule of,
you know, get them naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I found was you can actually get
away with a little less defoliation if you
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing- Because you've got that angled
light coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, and the fact that your plants
are circled, so they're spread out more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you're packing under a light,
you're actually creating microclimates in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, whether you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be spots where they're
okay, the spot's super shady and the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves are touching, you know,
and you develop a little spot in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little sweat bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you have it circled around,
you don't get that as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually control the spacing much
easier and the airflow, you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: microclimates anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a good way for,
this is a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You proved this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had, that house didn't have very large
ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were normal ceilings and you grew
fairly tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you were able to get almost all
the way to the ceiling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the light wasn't above your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: How high did you put that light at the
end?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the light up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably the top of the fixture was
maybe six inches from the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I adjusted the angle to be basically
as high as I could go with the little
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustable straps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wouldn't let me get any closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this little four inch gap that I
couldn't close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little yo-yos have that little space
you can't seal up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had it on basically the max it
would go, but it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you can do it for low ceilings is
using this method.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get the vertical stretch in
flower that you normally get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the inward growth and getting
inward growth is much more beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get big plants and make the tops
completely form a canopy on the inside
[SPEAKER_02]: towards your light, which is kind of
unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who've never seen a canopy form,
in a vertical fashion, it'll freak some
[SPEAKER_02]: growers out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to see it late in flower,
but I can see it in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you almost consider building a,
I'm thinking maybe like a chicken wire
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't trellis horizontally,
but you could probably trellis that
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically with the chicken wire type of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if somebody wanted to try this
at home and I recommend you use,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's fencing that has four inch gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like yard fencing or whatever
construction zone fencing or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes in a big roll of like 52 feet
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to cut out like, you know,
but it's already because it's in a roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make these nice,
you know, cages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can do is around your light,
you know, measure out a diameter of about
[SPEAKER_02]: 46 inches or whatever you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your distance and you can use that and
make one big circle around your light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that as a trellis, weave your plants
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the inside will just be a solid
wall of buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many strains did you run in this room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran two strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask if you were,
if you think it'd be better to just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of limit your strains or if you want to
run a whole multi strain run in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For plant consistency, you know,
spacing wise, you want to run pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: the same stuff because one plant that puts
is really wide is going to start really
[SPEAKER_02]: spacing into the skinny ones and you're
not really maximizing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are going to try this
method, keep it down to maybe a mono crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe two strains that are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to go OG Kush and lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely want to keep it consistent
through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like it for fino hunting though.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted to do that because each of
your plants are separated, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: already weaved into a trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are fino hunting and you find a
problem, you can quick pull that plant out
[SPEAKER_02]: and not have to go, oh crap, you know,
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for fino hunting, they're probably
smaller anyway, so you don't get as much
[SPEAKER_02]: of a jungle in there and you can just yank
them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being beside each other,
it's much easier to cut them out of any
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like support system you've got
going on in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you're more likely to
notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you've worked in a commercial
grow because when you started talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about cutting things out of a trellis,
you started shaking a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has PTSD from working with those
damn trellises.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was a harvest manager and I worked
with a lot of people who wanted to work
[SPEAKER_02]: fast, but not, you know, pay attention a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been cut, you know, by razor
blades, you know, trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it happens, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working in a commercial grow is not all
it's cracked up to be sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed it done yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, did you run into any issues with
growing like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have any problems that if
somebody's going to try this method out
[SPEAKER_00]: there from listening to the show,
they're going to go get a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to hang it vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to wrap a chicken wire cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to set plants up in a
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going to jump the light in
the middle and then they're going to weave
[SPEAKER_00]: it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of problems should they foresee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they should really do this with
if you're in a high humidity zone where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're battling that because the spacing
between the plants is going to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the airflow between your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't end up with any issues with
PM or anything that's going to cause any
[SPEAKER_02]: issues that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you didn't even run into any
issues this whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see it in your finished product,
bro, because this this grape beef jerky
[SPEAKER_00]: leather face smells fucking delicious,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, no, it's a really great method
for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend it for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't run into any real issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, now that I've done it,
I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the new way for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's not something you see
done every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people have the low
profile LEDs and they're kind of expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: to get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I wanted to have an option
to I could tell my friends like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, you know, what could I get into for
cheap that I have low ceilings and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm not working with a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a method that you can
recommend to your friends like,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, you don't have a big plant count.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to make you some
monsters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to do just fine,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this method done a hundred years
ago, basically, in Canada, but it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It disappeared once Canada stopped being
super popular for their beaster buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started making our own herb here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this method kind of dwindle off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Canada, they didn't they weren't
savvy enough to use the cool tube method
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've still got ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a bit of climate control by
using the cool tube to get all that light
[SPEAKER_00]: heat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: On a larger scale, do you think this would
be scalable?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a question I've asked myself a
couple of times, you know, because I've
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked in facilities and I'm like,
man, you know, would this be something we
[SPEAKER_02]: could actually bring or kind of actually
use in a commercial setting?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I unfortunately think the way we have
it now is the way to do it commercially.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to kind of keep the
overhead thing going just because this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's going to benefit somebody
with low ceilings or who is space reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your room is perfect for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the best room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, you could do four
thousands in here or you could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you made the right move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's maximizing what one light
can do for you as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I see guys, you know,
pack a room out with four lights and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they don't consider the input
costs, you know, OK, now you're running
[SPEAKER_02]: four lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your electricity bill is going to be a lot
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That house where you are wouldn't run four
thousands in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd know every breaker in that
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifteen amp breakers, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just know that because I know that
that's an old, old part of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doorways aren't tall enough for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to duck to go through those
doorways is how old that part of town is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be blowing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a thousand or two is your limit in
that house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a lot of time crawling under the
house and running wires to make that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're double door dank today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fictional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody tell my landlords.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this town, he doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody stole the copper wires or the
copper pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fucking satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day I come home that, you know,
like it's just all still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to say bad about this town.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes when your shit is still
there, that's all you needed to see is,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just feels good around here sometimes
because sometimes it might not still be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a, yeah, no, I shouldn't
say that on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a sliding glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a terrible idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I, I have my old place had a
sliding glass door, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: used to make me paranoid as crap,
you know, especially being around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm like, wow, you needed a big dog,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big rock separated them and all my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, um, I do love it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry is doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a lot of things to try to
fix up Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the city center is growing and
everywhere you drive a dispensary has
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsored the roads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's important to recognize
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you said that because I talk
a lot about how the legal cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: changed this town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lived here since I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, I turned 15 here and I'm 40
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been here for, I've left and come
back a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, in Lawrence, Kansas for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in New Mexico for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone some places, but I've seen it go
from, uh, just a town with nothing but
[SPEAKER_00]: bars and a steel mill to an actual
blossoming place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a cool little place now,
uh, before you couldn't eat anything after
[SPEAKER_00]: eight o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we got Grubhub that I could,
it's one in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could Grubhub some good food now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the cannabis industry's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry brought more job
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought a working wage for a
demographic that didn't really have an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 22 to 30 year old dudes and bros that
were kind of fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably would have been selling
drugs and committing crimes or on
[SPEAKER_00]: unemployment or working at the fucking
mill, breaking their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they get to grow cannabis in a legal,
they would have been growing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That showed a black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, a lot of the black market
growers, a lot of hands raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all went right to that legal industry
as soon as it was fucking ready,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it gave us opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave the working class opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that brought owners and investors,
people all over the nation and world
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to open grows and dispensaries and
extraction labs and edible kitchens and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else they could get involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people with a little bit of money came
from Denver, they came from wherever,
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just picking places and they brought
some money here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owners and the investors have some
bucks and they want to go to dinner too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their wives want to go shopping also.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get their nails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brought the demand for better shit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other tier up above them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess those were the owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the investors, they want to come here
too and visit and see what's going on at
[SPEAKER_00]: the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that got everything, another step
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see it growing every, I don't know,
I guess every quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there's a little bit of
expansion here and it's cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, the dispensaries,
when you drive down the highway and the
[SPEAKER_00]: streets, you see those, this portion of
the highway is sponsored by, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to pick any dispensary because nobody
paid for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: This portion of the highway is sponsored
by iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so team iReGenetics was out there in a
fucking glow in the dark vest cleaning up
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking highway one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really cool that it's
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got job opportunities and that's all
from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from another place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here as part of our workforce
because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is pretty fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different subject, but it kind of
makes me sad and happy at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have came here and they're
doing really successful now that they have
[SPEAKER_02]: this as an opportunity, as a career.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me sad that they had to leave
their home and their families to be in a
[SPEAKER_02]: state that allows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it makes me happy to see a lot of
people thriving and doing well,
[SPEAKER_02]: such as yourself, Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that people are coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that we've got a blooming cannabis
industry, but now this is the polite way
[SPEAKER_00]: of saying we're closed, we're full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need legal cannabis in your area,
I'd love that people come here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the steps here to make it happen
and you can do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get enough people, you get enough
motivation, you rally the troops,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make cannabis legal where you are,
then you don't have to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the majority of the states now
have some sort of cannabis available to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, legal or medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you folks that don't and you folks
that don't have what you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it the way you need to do it through
legislation and do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to move somewhere,
I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody is a political activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't all have a white mic on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to white mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you were here for this episode,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may need to do what you got to do
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody needs to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody needs to uproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have a sick kid that needs
fucking medicine today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't wait for legalization and
legislation to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kid's having fucking seizures and
it's miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are OK, let's try to work on it
where you are so we can get all the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: nation legalized and then we can get some
sort of nationwide fucking legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: going instead of just state to state
fucking chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're thinking about coming to
Colorado for being in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I heard Oklahoma is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're in love with mountains or
something, I would almost suggest Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: over here right now because it's brand
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're I'm not even trying to be
rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're full here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get a job in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also hard to get a house here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get a parking space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filling up quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, also with Oklahoma opening
up, there is a lot of companies who are
[SPEAKER_02]: jumping there right now and it's a lot of
more opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the market's been open for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you you're not going to make a
big dent in a market that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and unfortunately, I hate to say
this, unless you know somebody now here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's all about it's not what you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's who you know here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Oklahoma's got a lot more
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you can get a bank account in
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you move here and you try to open up a
bank account, they go, where do you work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, I work at this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, oh, then get the fuck out of our
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't mess with you stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oklahoma may be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to discourage anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive and it's hard here and it
snows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a lot of great
places that are also opening up
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to be a little
harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our industry right now is kind of at the
point where it's going to be less easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a great paying job starting out in the
industry where, you know, a while back it
[SPEAKER_02]: was starting a little higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, unfortunately, the way that the
industry has gone and this is the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: any standard standardized commercial
industry goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly the reason why cannabis was
expensive is because it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not illegal anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we open businesses and build large
scale cultivation facilities and we
[SPEAKER_00]: produce countless fucking grams and we
have employees and payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the value of the product has quickly
gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we open to too many stores and that
made the value of the product quickly go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can drive four miles in any direction
from here and there's a dispensary with
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say it's top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, there's plenty of fucking top shelf
fire on my fucking table right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this stuff used to be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be worth a lot more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This jar back in the day when I first got
to Colorado, 400 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, you'd be lucky to get a hundred
dollars for that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even disrespecting your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, there's so much herb and
there's so much supply that the demand is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, nah, I've got weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to give you $400 for
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get an ounce for a hundred dollars
and it'll work in my pipe just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the value is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're not making any money at the
commercial facilities because we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make every single gram count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to get rid of every employee
that's not pulling their weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need trimmers that can just fucking
trim like savage machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need fucking joint rollers that can
roll like savage machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no money in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that there's no money in it,
how am I going to pay the growers any
[SPEAKER_00]: money?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I pay the trimmers any money?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people that make any money are
the people with the word head or lead or
[SPEAKER_00]: manager in the front of their title or at
the end of their title.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only ones that are actually
making a decent salary at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead grower, the master grower,
he's probably doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making like maybe Porsche money,
but everybody else is making fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Corolla money in that facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's why it's important to
just take pride in, you know, what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you come to the state,
just know that there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: with badges and you know, it is going to
be, you know, probably not start out as
[SPEAKER_02]: high as you thought it was going to be in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this is something you want to be a
part of in your life and growing and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, Colorado is a great place,
but you know, make sure you like Jeff
[SPEAKER_02]: said, you know, change the laws in your
own town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to sound like we're full,
stay out, but it's getting crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-25 is no fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the more advocates too, that,
you know, there are out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more people trying to make changes,
you know, the more we can actually make a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandfather, he was on city council in
a city I won't name for his sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things he tells me all the
time is, you know, we can make a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: changes in this town, but people don't
actually show up to the meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't talk about what's important to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care what gets passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so then it's just up to a
council of people who get to decide
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they decide, you know,
and you know, we could be a part of that
[SPEAKER_02]: and suggesting things along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a very large part of the
people, who were instrumental in getting
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the medical marijuana stuff in
place here were under the age of 30 when
[SPEAKER_00]: it was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to be a politician.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be some suit wearing
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I were a large part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I'm not going to say I was a lot,
Mike did it for me because I was too shy,
[SPEAKER_00]: too afraid to go speak out because I was
doing the growing and trying to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mike was a youngster when he was doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't 30 yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't old people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just, we were bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to get the idea,
learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to listen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like city council has to hear you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't kick you out because you've got
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the beauty is in most states this in
these days have some kind of law or some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of reform of medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so they're going to take you a
little more serious than, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 15 years ago when, you know,
they would just laugh you out of probably,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a city council meeting if you
tried to bring that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're finally at an age where if
we actually showed up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: made it a point, I think, you know,
we can expect it all to be coming around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start a Facebook group or join the local.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably can't start a Facebook group
to support your local cannabis movement
[SPEAKER_00]: because Facebook isn't cannabis friendly
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find some other way to start a local
group or join your local chapter of
[SPEAKER_00]: normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every state has a normal chapter,
the national organization for the reform
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been fighting for cannabis
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the seventies, you see Cheech wear
on a normal shirt and a couple of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy, the Cheech and Chong shows from
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been with us for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need guidance in becoming active in
the cannabis activism scene, they will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great launch pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find like-minded folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may help you start a local chapter of
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start speaking up,
stoners are really, we're shy until we
[SPEAKER_00]: find other stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you go to work,
all you're doing the first day at a new
[SPEAKER_00]: job is wondering if that guy smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that guy smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just looking to see,
everybody goes to lunch alone on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: day and you come back and you're looking
to see who's got red eyes, who smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you know they smoke,
you're like, Hey, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're potheads together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, it's just, and that's how it
will happen in the city council realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you'll go, I want to legalize weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone else will go, Hey,
me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll go, well, come on, I'll show
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've probably got two or three
other friends that go, you guys are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will snowball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll realize there are so many
people in your community that wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: take some sort of action and did not know
how.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just with the dance, nobody wants to be
the first idiot dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go dance, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go shake your booty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get the city council party started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's funny too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned somebody giving you the
glance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was always the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, I know you smell like
weed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know you smell like weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then you're like,
I know I smell like weed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always a social interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people just know I smoke weed just
from walking by.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, that guy probably has better
weed than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the vibe I think I give off with my
appearance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just try to enjoy it with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all the kind words about my
weed tonight because honestly,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just always fun to share it with
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the important part to
remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow from your heart and you're just doing
it for the love of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great spot to wrap this up,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for coming and hanging
out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great talk about your vertical grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to share your social media or
other ways that people can find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure they've got questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to message you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can people direct message you so they
can learn more about your vertical grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm on Instagram, Double Door Dank,
not Dumbledore.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people like to confuse that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a wizard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a weed grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Double Door Dank on Instagram and you
can find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any questions you have for me,
feel free to shoot them over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's kind of vague on some of the
stuff in the episode, but I'd be more than
[SPEAKER_02]: happy to fill you in on any questions you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were vague, but it's basically hang a
bulb and put plants in a circle around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm so impressed by it,
because I saw what you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me what your harvest weight was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to reveal that on the show
from one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you worked for me, I'd go, yeah,
you can keep your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not fire you for those weights for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole idea was just to have fun
and try something I hadn't done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope maybe you guys give it a shot
too, because there are a lot of benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: to that method as well as just the overall
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's hung up some lights and grown
the normal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a great new experiment to
try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expand your horizons, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to do some more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stay stuck in that bubble,
you're just going to be stuck in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome back any time you want to
come, bro.
