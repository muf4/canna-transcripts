[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last couple of episodes were quite
intensive episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 709 was all about the evolution of dabs
and dabbing and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course we had Pedro and Roz and
Ryan on for episode 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode we're gonna relax,
we're gonna cool down a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna have a good time, we're gonna
talk about something we all enjoy,
[SPEAKER_00]: something we all indulge in, something
that may be a little bit of a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: weakness, maybe a point where we spoil
ourselves and treat ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna talk about munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better than having some munchies
after you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly this may be a weird side note and
this may derail the whole show here but I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to get super baked and not eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to fight those munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like those munchies you
get super baked, you take a few fat dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you start eating cookies and the
next thing you know not even stone
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta eat more cookies or you eat a
bunch you take a bunch of dabs and you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to out to dinner and halfway through
dinner you're like oh I just ruined my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong I love to go to dinner,
go to Thai food, order two entrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: super blazed and eat them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying sometimes I like to fight
off those munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always go right for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to fight that hunger, enjoy the
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: However when I do let those munchies take
over sometimes they win.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I let those munchies kick in I will eat
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about munchies, let's talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like to eat once you are
stoned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've had however you like to smoke,
you took a few bong ribs, smoked a fat
[SPEAKER_00]: joint, maybe you took too many dabs,
maybe you ate some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is something else we're going to
talk about here in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you enjoy to eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I often talk about trying to take care of
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be it's 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to take care of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be treating our bodies like our
temples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super young anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in my 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel it when I eat junk food.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I eat unhealthy crap my body does say
hey bro don't eat as much of that or don't
[SPEAKER_00]: eat that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body does have ways of letting us know
as you get older pay attention your body
[SPEAKER_00]: will tell you that is terrible for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop fucking doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things we put in our
bodies we shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get blazed and I do get the
munchies I try to stick with healthy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: However sometimes I will allow myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm human don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to eat healthy most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetarian 100% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegan most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do at least one vegan day every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care about my diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to take care of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get blazed I will allow myself to
slip on the diet, have some crap
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm on a road trip and I have to say if
I'm the passenger on a road trip just you
[SPEAKER_00]: know for legal and safety reasons and I do
get blazed and we stop at the gas station
[SPEAKER_00]: or somewhere small like that to get some
munchies I definitely will use that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: good excuse to indulge in some crap food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about what I get from the gas
stations in a moment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do prefer honestly to stick with
healthier snack options if that's possible
[SPEAKER_00]: available affordable effective if I
prepared properly and also if that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: my high mouth wants sometimes my stone
mouth wants something sugary and terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: for me sometimes I'll treat myself also I
smoke a lot and I do podcast I constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking talk I never stop talking I get it
I do know that about myself I apologize if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sick of hearing me but that also
brings in a lot of dryness a lot of dry
[SPEAKER_00]: throat a lot of dry mouth so I need snacks
I prefer snacks that are juicy and not
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydrating and drying something people
hate the word moist but guess what I need
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice moist snack something with some
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not something that's going to induce more
cotton mouth more dryness more phlegm I
[SPEAKER_00]: try to stay away from crackers like I
definitely don't want a cracker I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely don't need dairy products it's
gonna make me sound all in the throat I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need sorry for doing that that was
fucking rude I don't need all that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: snack so I try to stick with like healthy
stuff what is healthy stuff fruit a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people think that fruit is it's kind of a
hippie snack it's great it's what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: put here for it's got enough sugar to keep
you going it's give you some energy it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got all the right components to make that
sugar not unhealthy it's got fiber and
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamins in there depending on the fruit
or vegetables you choose but fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables are great for when you're
blazed what's better than biting into like
[SPEAKER_00]: a juicy orange think about how good that
is we have forgotten we go to the store
[SPEAKER_00]: and we get all that shit on the shelves
it's packaged and processed we forgot how
[SPEAKER_00]: good a fucking orange is bite into an
orange a nectarine a clementine something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that let that juice run down your
chin a little bit let it absorb into your
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue feel how good that shit is we
forgot how good basic fruit is so when I
[SPEAKER_00]: get blazed I like fruit watermelon
strawberry stuff like that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious if it's available like I said
sometimes you don't prepare sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not where that stuff is sometimes
you hit the gas station and you just eat
[SPEAKER_00]: crap that is when I allow myself to eat
crap I did I'm going somewhere with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this I did post a question to Instagram to
Twitter I also posted it to my discord
[SPEAKER_00]: that link is in the show notes and video
description but I asked a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends what they like to eat and consume
once they get blazed that's where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: leading with all this we're going to read
the responses to those surveys I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling to set it up real good here I
asked about do you allow yourself to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: crap or do you prefer to eat healthy
snacks once you get blazed I also asked do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have road trip snacks that you let
yourself eat then also I asked about
[SPEAKER_00]: regional snacks because I live in Colorado
here in the summer we have a chili
[SPEAKER_00]: festival so chilies are kind of our
regional thing I'm sure there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: regional stuff I'm not thinking about but
chilies are kind of our regional snack
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where you go people are known
and areas are known for their snacks here
[SPEAKER_00]: we have cantaloupes we have a lot of
cantaloupes in our area the rocky forward
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupes are super delicious things
like that regional stuff then we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about seasonal stuff are there seasonal
snacks that you enjoy I've got a dear
[SPEAKER_00]: friend somebody I care about a lot who
loves a peppermint cheesecake and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: passed the holiday season and she is gonna
go crazy until December because we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get a peppermint cheesecake that's a
seasonal snack she wishes she could have
[SPEAKER_00]: how about some fast food do you guys
indulge in fast food when you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: munchies I really try not to eat fast food
I've talked about how healthy I try to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly if the time is right if we're on
the road if I'm blazed if things come down
[SPEAKER_00]: to it I grew up in Southern California and
there's nothing like some Taco Bell just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of bean burritos from Taco Bell
don't tell me what's in there don't talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it just let me enjoy that shit with
a bunch of hot sauce and just let me enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: it when I'm blazed that's one of my
weaknesses one of my guilty pleasures if
[SPEAKER_00]: you will hashtag soccer soufflé I guess it
is time to share some feedback I also like
[SPEAKER_00]: some chipotle too give me nice and blazed
and let me eat some chipotle that's always
[SPEAKER_00]: fun but then don't be around in like an
hour I guess now is a good time to start
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing the feedback that I have collected
I've got a lot of screenshots here I
[SPEAKER_00]: basically asked what do you like to munch
when you get blazed let's jump into the
[SPEAKER_00]: screenshots the feedback part of the show
this one came from our buddy Juanzilla on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter it said my favorite fast food is
Bojangles for a wake and bake a cookout
[SPEAKER_00]: for late night munchies my seasonal snacks
would have to be the peppermint pretzels I

a couple of people just said randomly pies
[SPEAKER_00]: for old people so some people supported my
statement pies for old people bro that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a joke don't get offended we're gonna
keep moving um it says from Mary J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanus says my favorite munchy to eat when
I'm high is probably apples and peanut
[SPEAKER_00]: butter that sounds fucking great dude
apples that crispiness that juiciness and
[SPEAKER_00]: then peanut butter just to give you some
protein and some texture in there don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have me do a podcast after that but that
sounds great favorite fast food is Dunkin
[SPEAKER_00]: Donuts I absolutely love their bagels
smothered in cream cheese that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty nice again we've got that coldness
from the cream cheese that is a trend here
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst the stoners we gotta have
something cold and delicious in our snacks
[SPEAKER_00]: however I do crave Twizzlers every so
often and beef jerky has to be peppered
[SPEAKER_00]: the beef jerky that has to be peppered all

server you owe Greybeard a fist bump a
[SPEAKER_00]: high five a shout out maybe a little kiss
on the cheek however you want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: great kid good dude giant hog he built the
discord server and his comment says candy
[SPEAKER_00]: is my weakness sour gummy candy to be
specific I like savory to salty to sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: if I could have all three sour gummy
candies and then savory salty and sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: see I'm not a fan of the gummy candy sort
of stuff I don't like digging that candy
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of my teeth I'm not into that
kind of stuff but salty and savory hell
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah bro and sweet there's a Chex mix that
will fall right into that it's like salted
[SPEAKER_00]: honey something Chex mix bro that is salty
sweet crunchy savory it's all of the above
[SPEAKER_00]: that one will definitely scratch that itch
if you will then he says I hate spending
[SPEAKER_00]: money on drinks I drink water and I love
crunchy but not much of a cake guy I get
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do really enjoy being a stoner
being a talker I love drinks we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the things I love in a little
bit but I do spend a lot of money on
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious drinks perhaps that's why I stay
I'm a skinny dude I'm 6'5 and under 200
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds because I don't eat a lot of junk I
think most of my snacks are drinks which
[SPEAKER_00]: means I get to just pee out most of it
then he goes on to say crunchy but not
[SPEAKER_00]: much of a cake guy sometimes bro birthday
cake cupcakes the cupcakes with fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkles on them at a gas station that is
one of my weaknesses oh yeah healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: snacks usually peanuts or almonds dude I
love pistachios especially the pistachios
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been cracked already and they're
coated in the the roasted Thai chili
[SPEAKER_00]: seasoning oh man I'll eat the whole bag
like the whole bag it says also some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fruit or almonds or peanuts I eat crap
food when I get stoned when not stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: something I'm trying to get better at oh
let's see I eat crap stoned oh he eats
[SPEAKER_00]: crap when he is stoned and not stoned I
get it bro we live in America where they
[SPEAKER_00]: feed us and offer us all of the shit that
we should not be eating and something you
[SPEAKER_00]: will notice this is a weird political rant
I'm not gonna go too far on the cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: the food the worse it is for you like the
worse shit is more affordable until you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to shop and eat like vegetarian
shopping is cheap once you figure it out
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and vegetables and things to
sustain rice is cheap but yeah they make
[SPEAKER_00]: they really make it seem expensive to take
care of yourself let's stay on track
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese and South Korean candy is the
best candy in the world yes one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: notes later is exotic turps Cheetos used
to come out with the cinnamon sugar puffs
[SPEAKER_00]: during Christmas could eat a whole bag of
those in one sitting I haven't ever seen
[SPEAKER_00]: those bro but that sounds like a great
idea that makes me think of the Taco Bell
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking cinnamon twist at Taco Bell
probably similar but better then he said
[SPEAKER_00]: subs Jersey Mike's Jimmy John's Penn
Station I love subs bro not to be a hater
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm a vegetarian and Jersey Mike's
just fucking sucks there's I can eat
[SPEAKER_00]: grease and cheese that's basically what I
get offered in there would you like a
[SPEAKER_00]: grease and cheese sandwich and I'm like
I'm gonna hard pass on that shit I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: get diarrhea somewhere else but I get it
if you're into subs if you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shaggy and scooby about your life you go
ahead and do your thing and enjoy it um it
[SPEAKER_00]: does go on there is more from my soil guy
you guys I do have a lot of feedback so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna get through these kind of
quickly because I feel I realize I am
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a long time it says my favorite
fast food when I'm stoned is the one
[SPEAKER_00]: someone got for me against my wishes but
because I can't think of any fast food I
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's there and it fits me so this
person basically is my soil guy friend
[SPEAKER_00]: here this dude is indecisive refuses to
think just wants food delivered and since
[SPEAKER_00]: he's nosy so indecisive let me shut the
fuck up and eat what is delivered I can
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that bro you'll take whatever
I'm having I'll just order two and pass
[SPEAKER_00]: you one and hopefully you like it that's
easy enough for me bro that's adventurous
[SPEAKER_00]: you may end up with some shit you don't
want this one I was waiting to run into a
[SPEAKER_00]: note like this a reply like this because
it says there was this sour tangerine
[SPEAKER_00]: homemade weed gummy that someone gave me
once I should never be allowed around
[SPEAKER_00]: those when I'm high it says they were so
good I would probably never come down so I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess sour sweets infused foods fried
snacks dude fried shit is good you could
[SPEAKER_00]: deep-fry anything and I might eat it
stacking different flavors of Pringles
[SPEAKER_00]: that's magical right there dude spicy
jalapeno barbecue ranch or whatever most
[SPEAKER_00]: Asian food boogers but I said boogers and
it says burgers if you eat your boogers
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down but please don't invite me um
sushi dim sum soda bro you'd eat just
[SPEAKER_00]: about fucking everything hard cider pasta
carbs comfort food this guy is down to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: everything oh maybe this is not a guy this
could be a gal they're called aria sin era
[SPEAKER_00]: sin I can't read and I apologize for
assuming your gender it's 2022 I should
[SPEAKER_00]: have known better I do see the rainbows
and the icon I'm confused it says there is
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing seasonal that I won't make any
time of the year if I want it I do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that the thing I wanted to talk
about is those damn edibles I do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I'll have some delicious edibles
there's a company called coda that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolates they're way overpriced but
they're decadent medicated chocolates I
[SPEAKER_00]: also have some peanut butter cookies over
there that will fucking ruin your life you
[SPEAKER_00]: eat these coda chocolates and you're like
that was really good I don't feel high I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna eat more of those chocolates and
then guess what you're fucked up but the
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolates are so good you just keep
eating more of them shout out to my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen Karen passed away a couple of years
ago love you Karen rest in peace Karen
[SPEAKER_00]: would made would make fudge and carrot
cake that you could not get enough of they
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to put electrodes around it
because I would constantly be reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: into the fudge and taking little bites of
it and I would forget that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: medicated and by halfway through the day
my eyes would be so heavy that I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: function I would have the money she's in a
lot like our friend here I would keep
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching in and going back for more of
that medicated fudge I would just be goofy
[SPEAKER_00]: by the end of the day things would be hard
to handle but I worked at a dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: where the owner made medicated fudge and
encouraged me to eat it so it's her fault
[SPEAKER_00]: love you Karen sorry for being so high at
work all the time it was your fault dude
[SPEAKER_00]: all right let's keep going I thought
that's funny though when you get high and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep eating the edibles and you keep
getting higher and you keep eating the
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles and you're like what's going on
here man you fall into that loop I love it
[SPEAKER_00]: the the weed edible matrix all right we do
have another one that came from snazzy
[SPEAKER_00]: sneakers big up to our friend snazzy
sneakers that last message came from era
[SPEAKER_00]: sin I apologize for assuming your gender
big up much respect you can correct me
[SPEAKER_00]: politely let me know who I'm talking to if
you care what goes on it says from snazzy
[SPEAKER_00]: my wife's cookies dunked in a hot cup of
coffee is going to give me diabetes but I
[SPEAKER_00]: will do it with a smile on my face bro
isn't that how it is sometimes snacks are
[SPEAKER_00]: so good you're like yeah taking fucking
six weeks off my life with every cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: but guess what I don't want to get old
anyway then it goes on it says sweet and
[SPEAKER_00]: spicy pickles are probably the only thing
resembling healthy food that I reach for
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm high that's such a good debate is
a pickle a spicy snack who cares it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: good and we're back to the trend cold and
refreshing I notice the pot heads like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cold and refreshing snack all of that cold
and refreshing snack talk makes me need to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit a drink of this cold and refreshing
kombucha here we'll talk about that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute I'm gonna take a drink not edit
this you guys hang out drink something
[SPEAKER_00]: while I'm doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the feeling of carbonation
going down the throat when I'm good and
[SPEAKER_00]: blazed I feel like what's that soap with
the scrubbing bubbles I feel like it just
[SPEAKER_00]: gets in there knocks out the what do you
call it earlier the pasties just gets in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and scrubs out the pasties the
cottonmouth nothing like some good
[SPEAKER_00]: kombucha bubbles I was I used to be an
avid dr. pepper addict I would drink a
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous and embarrassingly gross amount
of dr. pepper every day I was doing a kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a battle how high can I get and I need
to battle it out or even it out with
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine and now I'm too caffeinated let's
dab more now let's drink more caffeine and
[SPEAKER_00]: by the end of the day I'd be fucking
anxious and shaky and I called it blown
[SPEAKER_00]: out my mind couldn't fucking focus I
couldn't make eye contact with anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was so high and so caffeinated
that I wasn't either one and my body was
[SPEAKER_00]: just fried I haven't had caffeine and dr.
pepper in probably two and a half nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: three years I think if I've got my time
right something I've noticed is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: time period my thoughts are more clear I
have less anxiety my panic attacks are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost gone much less frequent so that
you're not taking care of yourself it
[SPEAKER_00]: could definitely help you feel better just
to make a few minor adjustments just take
[SPEAKER_00]: out some of the crap you don't even have
to add anything you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything just take out some of the crap
replace the dr. pepper with a bottle of
[SPEAKER_00]: water something like that all right let's
get back onto it that's enough preaching
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't come here for the preachy shit
you came here for the the munchy talk our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend snazzy also says bacon wrapped
cream cheese stuffed jalapenos that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hell of a snack right there bro that's uh
I don't eat the bacon part but that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: good it says there's this snow cone and
frozen custard place down the street from
[SPEAKER_00]: me where I used to live called s&j's that
has the best goddamn concrete sundaes I
[SPEAKER_00]: could smash all day it sounds like you
fell in love bro uh what's in there I
[SPEAKER_00]: might try one it goes on it says uh those
strawberry hard candies with the chewy
[SPEAKER_00]: center that are always in grammy's candy
jar dude I know exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about I talk about that that's
what strawberry starburst smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: those candies are delicious that gooey
texture in the middle oh yeah now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting older I can't eat shit like that I
feel like those candies are actively
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to pull out my teeth as I'm eating
them so don't eat that kind of shit but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah then he said plain ass ice water is
my drink of choice but I understand that I
[SPEAKER_00]: try to drink a lot of water water is super
refreshing for a guy that talks so much I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely need a lot of water a lot of
voice lubrication I understand that so big
[SPEAKER_00]: up on a lot of water you guys drink a lot
of water you will feel better your brain
[SPEAKER_00]: will function your body will function
better water is good for you and there it
[SPEAKER_00]: is again that cold refreshing snack for
the pot heads all right these next few
[SPEAKER_00]: replies I'm gonna burn through it says
responses these are from from Instagram I
[SPEAKER_00]: did post the same question what do you
like to eat when you're blazed on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram I'm quickly gonna go through a
lot of these I may skip some then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna talk a little bit about what I like
I feel like this episode has gotten longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than I had anticipated and preferred not a
big deal you guys like the long shows um
[SPEAKER_00]: what do I have up here that I want to make
sure not to miss oh before we go that far
[SPEAKER_00]: let me miss this and then we cover this
last note so I could scroll something I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed is super popular and this is just
a side random branch here I have I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: frequenting sneaker shops I go to a lot of
sneaker stores I buy a lot of hoodies and
[SPEAKER_00]: sneakers it's just something I enjoy while
I'm there I noticed that all of them have
[SPEAKER_00]: a small section of what they're calling
exotic snacks they've got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator with a bunch of crazy-looking
sodas and drinks and exotic snacks is
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what it is exotic turps there are
like Cheetos and Doritos and Lays chips
[SPEAKER_00]: from other countries with crazy exotic
foreign flavors we've never experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: there are candies cookies what did I try
the other day it was a Faygo rocket
[SPEAKER_00]: popsicle soda it gave me the most
tremendous burps and I haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with that much flavor in it in a
long long time but that shit was
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously delicious so this exotic
imported Chinese candy Chinese turps thing
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be really popular right now and
at the sneaker shops I frequent they're
[SPEAKER_00]: charging like 18 to 25 dollars for a
bottle of beverages that is the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: this water bottle just a normal maybe a
little bigger you know it's your 16 maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 ounce soda bottle for 18 or 24 dollars
they got some Doritos in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors I've never seen before flavors
that are summer I buy some of them and try
[SPEAKER_00]: them out sometimes my friends own the shop
in a couple of locations so we'll all just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw down a couple of bucks for a bag and
we'll open it up and I'll just try a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of Doritos some of them are amazing
there's one with tacos it's got I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Chinese writing I really am NOT sure
it looks Chinese to me and it's some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of Doritos and they've got a taco on the
picture it's taco flavored Doritos right
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the taco we get here this one
tasted like I was like crunch and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like okay it tastes like a taco then I was
like nah bro there's beef in there and I
[SPEAKER_00]: kept chewing up the Doritos and I was like
there's the lettuce and there's the cheese
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's the salsa and there's a little
bit of cilantro coming in right now like I
[SPEAKER_00]: tasted every component of a taco in these
fucking Doritos so these exotic turps are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting real popular it's really fun I
like just I'll buy a couple of random
[SPEAKER_00]: things and have a few bros over and we'll
come take some dabs and dab out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: about anybody want to try some fucking
Chinese Doritos we can't even read what it
[SPEAKER_00]: says on the label and we'll all try it and
see what it tastes like fun times some
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies some other weird snacks some
things with Pokemon on the label I had no

[SPEAKER_00]: to eat when I'm blazed never gonna wrap up
this show cuz it has gotten much longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than I had anticipated and prepared for
you guys have heard enough but thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for hanging out talking about munchies I
hope you ate a whole bunch of snacks
[SPEAKER_00]: during this show type in the comments
right now what you have been snacking on
[SPEAKER_00]: also while you're there click like and if
you haven't already please do subscribe to
[SPEAKER_00]: the show now let's talk about it I already
mentioned I like kombucha for the bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot I got to keep the voice fresh
I got to stay hydrated I got to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: moving I like kombucha a lot people have
asked me a lot about kombucha and advice
[SPEAKER_00]: about kombucha kombucha is a very acquired
taste there are lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties flavors types of kombucha this
one I'm showing to the camera here is
[SPEAKER_00]: Kavita brand nobody pays me I buy kombucha
at the store just like everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: Kavita K E V I T a master brew kombucha
this is a ginger flavored one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites I really enjoy the tart cherry
from this brand this is what I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: call gas station kombucha this isn't real
real high in probiotics real fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored this is kind of a kombucha soda
entry-level amateur kombucha if I'm at the
[SPEAKER_00]: gas station if options are limited if the
stores are low on inventory these are
[SPEAKER_00]: refreshing they taste good it's not a soda
it's a good snack it's a good drink for
[SPEAKER_00]: the day I like the bubbles a lot when I'm
blazed but if you want to be healthy and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're drinking kombucha for health
reasons I definitely prefer GT's brand
[SPEAKER_00]: kombucha they make a lot of different
great kombucha's there's the raw and
[SPEAKER_00]: unfiltered this one's organic and
unpasteurized a lot of them say synergy
[SPEAKER_00]: here you'll see a lot of different words
this blue flavor is one of my favorites
[SPEAKER_00]: they said it was going to be seasonal we
kind of demanded that it was not seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they heard us this one is called
sacred life this one has without reading I
[SPEAKER_00]: do remember I think it's got kiwi juice
coconut water and ginger and then all the
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics from a kombucha in there this
is more of a potent fermented pungent sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a kombucha this one it takes a little
getting used to if you're not into that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can drink a good beer if you're into
fermented things you will enjoy this it
[SPEAKER_00]: may take some getting used to some
adjustment this is more of the entry-level
[SPEAKER_00]: brand if you try one kombucha and you
don't like it that doesn't mean you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like kombucha's every brand does it
differently different flavors dilutions
[SPEAKER_00]: styles some are real bold and like dark
beer kind of flavored some tastes like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking bum wine and fruit juice there are
a lot of options don't let it turn you
[SPEAKER_00]: down turn you off also don't force it if
you don't like it you just don't like it
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really enjoy a good kombucha after
all that talk I'm gonna take a hit of this
[SPEAKER_00]: ginger kombucha just now I can't resist
anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah those good bubbles good refreshing
ginger bite it's got it like a nice bite
[SPEAKER_00]: to it and that fermented flavor I got some
German blood in me there's got to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: Norwegian some Dutch in me something like
that maybe some Scottish I got a red beard
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly I haven't done the 23
and me yet but those people from those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions tend to enjoy fermented type food
so it only makes sense that I would like a
[SPEAKER_00]: kombucha also I don't drink because I have
a problem regulating my alcohol content
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been drinking years but I love a good
dark beer so it's only likely that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy a kombucha let's move on what do I
like to eat for snacks bro lately I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been munching pistachios they're healthy I
don't feel like I'm eating shit they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not super sugary they're not bad for my
teeth they satiate hunger they give me
[SPEAKER_00]: energy I'm sure there's like some sort of
nutrients some sort of selium or selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: or some something's got to be good for my
hair teeth nails and eyes and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: pistachios the Thai chili pistachios are
divine I can eat the whole damn however
[SPEAKER_00]: big the bag is I can eat it all on a drive
on a road trip during a movie let's crunch
[SPEAKER_00]: down on some pistachios I like depending
on the mood the environment the situation
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like spicy snacks if I'm hanging
out with a lady watching a movie obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going 100% spicy I'm not gonna do
the garlic and oniony type stuff that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would enjoy if I'm hanging out with a lady
if I'm at the house by myself like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody here I'm gonna crunch down on some
garlic and parmesan boulder chips later
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like spicy crunchy savory sort of
snacks or something I mostly go for
[SPEAKER_00]: something that makes me feel I said a
moment ago full and satiated but not like
[SPEAKER_00]: a piece of shit like I'm just eating
useless calories and feeding my body crap
[SPEAKER_00]: now with that being said sometimes if I'm
on the road I've talked about this I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to get cupcakes and shit like that that's
my excuse just driving from Boulder to
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo or Denver to Pueblo or wherever I
might be going that weekend coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: from a concert or something all the
restaurants are closed I didn't plan ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiba Hut was closed I love some good
Chiba Hut when I'm blazed shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiba Hut but if I didn't get some Chiba
Hut if we missed the opportunity for Chiba
[SPEAKER_00]: Hut or Fuzzy's tacos or something that's
when I'm gonna go to the gas station get
[SPEAKER_00]: some cupcakes or I like to try like
different kind of energy bars and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: but those are overpriced and they're still
that's just a candy bar you're just eating
[SPEAKER_00]: shit anyway so you'll often see me get
like some Cool Ranch Doritos maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of garlicky spicy crunchy potato
chips or something like that and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: grab like a cupcake I mentioned earlier I
like those birthday cake cupcakes I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like the orange cupcakes I may sound crazy
but the orange flavored cupcakes are great
[SPEAKER_00]: the cake is good it's always nice and
moist to get that creamy center and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the frosting has got like a little just a
texture that I enjoy that's really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: for me I don't do candy stuff I've said
that I'm not into like the sweet tarts and
[SPEAKER_00]: crunchy candy gummy candy suckers that's
not for me no nerd ropes none of that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you may see me much a brownie if
the brownies are right a brownie corner
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little bit of crunch in that
texture I'm down with the brownie but I
[SPEAKER_00]: really try to stay away from that stuff
drinks I said that I drink a lot of drinks
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of my snacks are drinks I cannot
