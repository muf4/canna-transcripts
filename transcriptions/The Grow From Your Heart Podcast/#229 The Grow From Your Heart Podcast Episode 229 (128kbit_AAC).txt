[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 229 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kev, Ku and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody's having a great evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you are as dabbed out as I am right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am smoking on some, what am I smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me grab the label because I keep
messing this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called Screaming Tangerines and it
is delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking the Screaming Tangerines
for the past couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a really nice orange candy sort
of a flavor and a really nice sativa head
[SPEAKER_02]: buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I open the container,
it just smells like an orange candy or an
[SPEAKER_02]: orange creamsicle or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really digging the flavor of the Screaming
Tangerines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I usually prefer candy flavored dabs
like Tangy or Tangerines or of course the
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon Jeffery or maybe the Strawberry Icy
I had a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Clementine is always delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer that candy flavored sort of dab
thing and I've also noticed that the candy
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors are quite often the sativas that
give me that nice head buzz that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I go for a dab, I usually prefer
the Tangy, the Screaming Tangerine,
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon Jeffery, anything with that candy
sort of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually my favorite sort of dabs to
go for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was at the dispensary a few days ago
and they had some Gorilla Glue live batter
[SPEAKER_02]: and something about the smell of it,
smelling it right now, just really drew me
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer my flowers to be the cushy,
diesel-y kind of smell and my dabs of
[SPEAKER_02]: course to be the candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I smelled this Gorilla Glue,
something in my nose was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, buy a gram of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got a gram of it and I had been
dabbing on it and when I smoke this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just does something to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me have to sit down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Gorilla Glue has been fucking me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this nice change has been a great
treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad I smelled that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that episode a few weeks ago called
Follow Your Nose and I'm glad I took my
[SPEAKER_02]: own advice and followed my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, before I get too far and too
rambly, let me make one apology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, my episode did not load and so
it's not repeated in iTunes, but if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: listening on like Pod Bay or Podcaster or
something like that, that episode will be
[SPEAKER_02]: in the feed twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on Stitcher, I encourage you and
invite you to go back and listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: episode number 227.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have came out Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not make it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The episode features Mike and myself and
I'm sure you would like to hear what you
[SPEAKER_02]: missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the episode is up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also apologize for it taking me until
Friday to correct a Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept thinking maybe Stitcher would email
me and reply and fix it and I didn't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to repost it and then have them fix it and
the episode be there twice and it just be
[SPEAKER_02]: a clusterfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead, I just did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being patient with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, huge thank you to everybody who sent
me a tweet, an email, a Facebook message,
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone who reached out and said,
hey, dude, where's my Monday episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets me know that you guys are actually
paying attention and that you miss me when
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for keeping an eye on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it ever happens again, please do email
me right away because I don't listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: the show on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen to my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I record it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listen back and edit it and then I put
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really weird of me to listen
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me know if it fails, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could tell that those tangerine dabs
are making my brain spin, can't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going super fast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a quick second, center the
self.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would like to read an article
from the Westward that talks about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis recalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This article is from the Westward.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was written Friday, July 28th.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually published Friday,
July 28th.
[SPEAKER_02]: The article is by Thomas Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the start of the article, there's just
a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline is Denver issues first recall
for mite infested moldy marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's get to this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture of a plant, a cannabis
plant that is in full bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would guess this is seven or eight weeks
into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is close to being harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this plant is fucking covered in
disgusting spider mites, just riddled with
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spider mites have built a teepee on
top of this bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a web that goes from the top cola
of this bud out to every single leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it forms like a circus tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a circus tent of spider
mites, but it's all just a big web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And inside that web, I can see hundreds,
if not thousands of little spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're crawling all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every leaf, every section of this plant is
crispy and crunchity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every plant behind it looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the worst case of spider mites I
have ever seen a photo of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in a grow in Denver where we
are allowed to grow legally, where we are
[SPEAKER_02]: given guidelines on pesticides we can and
cannot use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow this shit still happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's read the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem didn't end there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two days later, the city of Denver
announced that Buddies Wellness was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first Denver marijuana grower recalling
marijuana for mold and mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you guys, they do test our
cannabis for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not allowed to use a lot of
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you grow in a commercial grow,
before you can sell anything, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a sample bud from that grow and send
it to a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is then tested for mold, it's tested
for yeast, it's tested for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: The results are sent back and then once
they are sent back, the product is what's
[SPEAKER_02]: called released and we are allowed to move
it from the grow location to retail
[SPEAKER_02]: locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until then, it sits in a safe room and it
cannot be touched by anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been several cases of crops
being destroyed because of pesticides
[SPEAKER_02]: being found in the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first case of them destroying
and recalling products for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's ridiculous that they had
spider mites that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to continue with the article
before my iPad reloads the page again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It throws me off, it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: On every cannabis product you buy,
I'm just gonna pick up something here,
[SPEAKER_02]: this one, this jar right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a jar from a dispensary in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got their label on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can find their OPC number.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, okay, this came from MMC number,
Medical Marijuana Cultivation Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 402- and I'm not gonna read you the
numbers for my product because that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to implement their numbers in
this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell where this came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell where this was grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was grown in MMC number 402- and it
was extracted by another one that I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: find the number on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, oh, it's all the same center.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was grown and extracted by the same
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that product was tainted, they would
issue a recall with the number on it and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would take it back and they would give me
a full refund.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would probably exchange out for a
different product that wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: To tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, so everything does have an optional
premise cultivation code on every
[SPEAKER_02]: container that you buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything with the optional, and I'll read
out the number for you guys right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything with the OPC code of 403-00364
from La Bodega prior to July 27th,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are urged to return or destroy your
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if it's already, if you bought a
gram and it's already half a gram,
[SPEAKER_02]: take it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if they'll give you another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if they'll return it just because of
this recall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take this article with you and be like,
no, they said to bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my money back.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've already smoked it, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you're not going to get sick
from smoking a little bit of powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew and spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chances are you've smoked a shit ton
before and just didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just act like you didn't know this time
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do feel sick from it, if you think
you've got some problems from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to the doctor and get yourself checked
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Powdery mildew, it can make you sick on
its own, but what it will do is if you've
[SPEAKER_02]: already got a compromised immune system,
powdery mildew can definitely exacerbate
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever problems you've already got,
especially if they are sinus related,
[SPEAKER_02]: respiratory related, immune related,
any kind of mildew added to that will
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely fuck you up a little extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got product from there,
return it or just throw it away,
[SPEAKER_02]: your choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes, the DEH recall notice said there
have been no reports of illness from
[SPEAKER_02]: Buddy's products, but noted that samples
of dried marijuana contained potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: unsafe levels of yeast and mold while live
plants were found contaminated with mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: and mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk about the yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very easy to fail a yeast test for
cannabis in Colorado, just a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: too much moisture for a little bit too
long and yeast develops on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can lose entire crops to just a
little bit of yeast in your post harvested
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times it happens after the plants
are cut down, they're cut down,
[SPEAKER_02]: they hang dry, they're harvested,
they're trimmed, they're put in a
[SPEAKER_02]: container and then somebody closes that
container for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's moisture in there, it walks up the
moisture, the air, they put it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: dark, it starts making a little bit of
yeast and then they test it and the
[SPEAKER_02]: growers think they're curing the product
perfectly, but that little bit of excess
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture creates yeast and then they fail
a microbial test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not a hard test to fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one is really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with all the other shit going on,
I'm just going to assume that these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are fucking that up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unsafe levels of yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mold is powdery mildew, mold could be
bud rot, mold could be a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to assume it was a powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: While live plants, oh no, it says they
differentiate between powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had straight bud mold,
they had moldy bud in their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: While live plants were found contaminated
with mildew and spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show a picture at the bottom of the
page here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant has got enough powdery mildew
on it to where it just looks like a
[SPEAKER_02]: powdered donut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you just threw powdered
donut sugar all over these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how somebody worked in there
and didn't get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to have been wearing a respirator
just to walk in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they know not to do something about
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to continue with the
article here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the mold recall stems from a DEH
investigation to residual levels of,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me try to say this right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, I've always read this word and
I've never tried to say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think unless it was on the
podcast, myclobutanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was easier than it looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Investigation into residual levels of
myclobutanol found in Buddy's trim and
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates by state approved cannabis
testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to department of health
investigation reports, received through a
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado open records act requested from
Westward.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really long sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myclobutanol is used to fight powdery
mildew and marijuana and is commonly found
[SPEAKER_02]: in Eagle 20, a fungicide applied to grapes
and other agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is banned as a marijuana pesticide by
the Colorado department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you guys, we cannot use
Eagle 20 in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should not be using Eagle 20 in your
private grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to follow the Colorado marijuana
enforcement division guidelines on any
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that I am in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is a marijuana enforcement division
regulated grow or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a private grow, if it's a
commercial grow, if it's a caregiver grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is, I try to follow those
guidelines because I feel like they have
[SPEAKER_02]: done their research and they know what we
should and should not be using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why not just learn how to do
everything based on their rules because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the way everything is heading
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just learn to play by the rules,
you don't have to adjust so strongly when
[SPEAKER_02]: they start enforcing the rules on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just follow the rules from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's keep moving in the
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like this, Buddy's owner and
operator Gabriel Sandoval says that
[SPEAKER_02]: myclobutanol levels on his trim and
concentrates resulted from a residue left
[SPEAKER_02]: in his pesticide applicators years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moldy and mite infested plants cited
by the DEH were plants put on hold for
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide testing that he'd been waiting
to destroy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's saying that the pesticide was a
residual that was left in the paint
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayer because a lot of these guys use a
paint sprayer as an applicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was left in the pesticide applicators
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he didn't clean out his paint sprayer
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what he's trying to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's just been in there for years
because you're supposed to clean those out
[SPEAKER_02]: when you get done using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what kind of sprayer you're
using, you're supposed to triple rinse
[SPEAKER_02]: that bitch before you put anything else in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sounds fishy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he just let it sit for a couple of
years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he not clean it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has he not sprayed anything else through
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't sound right to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he also says that the plants that were
moldy were plants that were put on hold
[SPEAKER_02]: for pesticide testing that he'd been
waiting to destroy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he wasn't even taking care of the
plants that were going to be tested to see
[SPEAKER_02]: if they were contaminated with pesticides
because he knew he had to destroy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes on to say, they told us not to
spray anything before we took the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we left it alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said this stuff was going to get
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, I didn't want to waste money on
lights and water to maintain them because
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they weren't going to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's telling him that he was told not
to spray anything, which doesn't make
[SPEAKER_02]: sense because you're allowed to spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they're coming, they want to know
what you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they're coming to check.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making sure you're doing shit
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't want to keep feeding the
plants and take care of the plants because
[SPEAKER_02]: he knew they were going to get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did he know they were going to get
destroyed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he know they were not going to pass
tests?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they would have passed tests,
there would have been no need to destroy
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were only going to be destroyed if
they failed the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he knew they were not going to pass
these tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: He quit feeding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just quit taking care of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandoval should have maintained the plants
well enough to keep fungus and pests at
[SPEAKER_02]: bay, according to a DEH investigation
report filed right before the July 27th
[SPEAKER_02]: recall was ordered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based upon visual evidence, of insects and
mold on live flowering plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, statements from staff regarding
pervasiveness of insects and mold within
[SPEAKER_02]: the facility, and laboratory reports
listing high levels of yeast and mold in
[SPEAKER_02]: dried plant material, the Denver
Department of Environmental Health finds
[SPEAKER_02]: sufficient evidence that plant material is
potentially unsafe for human consumption,
[SPEAKER_02]: the report reads.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I'm glad I've never had cannabis with
that label on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unsafe for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fucked up stamp to put on your
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, despite Sandoval's claims that he
was ordered to not spray or clean the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants for 72 hours, DEH food safety and
marijuana program supervisor Carolyn
[SPEAKER_02]: Laveau says that any marijuana plant put
on hold by the DEH can be fully
[SPEAKER_02]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that includes allowing the application
of Colorado Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: approved fungicide and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is pretty sure that that's a
clear thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that works in an MED regulated
facility should know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody with any worker protection safety
training should know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody with any Department of Ag training
should know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you work in these facilities as a
master grower, that is your responsibility
[SPEAKER_02]: to know that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't know that shit,
you got to call the lawyer, you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: call the owner, you got to call the
compliance officer, you got to call
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody and figure it out, quit fucking
it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in charge of a grow,
find out what you are and are not allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: to do because this is serious right now,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to continue with the article,
but first let's talk about this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buddy's Wellness destroyed every plant in
its Cedar Avenue grow on July 27th.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture of a warehouse with some
five gallon buckets with some shitty
[SPEAKER_02]: looking dirt in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like cocoa with not enough
perlite and they've got tomato cages on
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but all the plants are just chopped
down on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have got five gallon buckets of cocoa
on a concrete floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a professional setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the plants up off the fucking floor,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, it says the July 27th recall
came on the same day that the,
[SPEAKER_02]: that Buddy's voluntarily destroyed every
plant in its grow, throwing away 72
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering plants, 119 vegging plants and
nearly 20 pounds of dried flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: according to a Department of Health
investigation report.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like they're trying to shut us
down, Sandoval says.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a small family run business,
so this is a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this may sound like some
bullshit to you, but as a small family run
[SPEAKER_02]: business, this should never happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a small family run business,
that was very few plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got more plants than that in one room
at the grow I run at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got more plants than that in one
small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take care of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have taken care of this grow by
myself and not have gotten this many
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: With two pesticide applications per week
and then a release of predator mites just
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of weeks into flower,
they never would have had this problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to be cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened, but they were
failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very small grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's trying to say we're a small mom
and pop business.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're that small, this should not have
been a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have been able to get in there
and fucking take care of these pests by
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell that these plants are not
defoliated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are mites all over every leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would have pulled off some of the
leaves, you would have taken off a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the opportunity for powdery mildew to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have taken off a lot of
opportunity for spider mites to hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys don't seem to have done
anything to prevent bugs or powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't seem to know what they needed
to do by the looks of the pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: The DEH pictures below show a cultivation
riddled with powdery mildew and spider
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandoval says he's decided to destroy
those plants weeks before the photos were
[SPEAKER_02]: taken, but wasn't allowed to do so until
Department of Health and Marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: Enforcement Division agents were present
per state regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says the plants pictured below were
destroyed the same days the photos were
[SPEAKER_02]: taken on July 5th and July 21st,
and DEH investigator Richard Pruckler
[SPEAKER_02]: confirms that Sandoval destroyed the
plants after the pictures were snapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a case like this, you guys,
normally on a normal day, if I've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant in the grow and I decide,
hey, I don't need this plant, I can
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes through a wood chipper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered green waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be destroyed towards
unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes through a wood chipper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets mixed into a bag with kitty litter
and leftover soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it is mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it is put into a trash can that is
locked and it's removed by a trash
[SPEAKER_02]: service.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I have to do is go to my
computer and mark that plant number that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's killed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to cut the plant tag in half and
throw that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that plant is dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not exist in my system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a case like this, when they've got
contaminated plants, they have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: destroyed under supervision.
[SPEAKER_02]: People from the MED and the Department of
Ag and the Department of Health come and
[SPEAKER_02]: watch you destroy these plants to make
sure they are not snuck out the back door
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that you don't do anything
fishy with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they watch them destroy the 20
pounds of herb that they said they had to
[SPEAKER_02]: get rid of also, because I don't want that
shit to make it to the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, that's why black market cannabis
is dangerous, because there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit sprayed in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be yeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be having fungus in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't give a shit because they
need to make their money and nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_02]: going to come look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would recommend that you go through a
dispensary if you were in Colorado and get
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis through a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not tested, it gets destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't enjoy doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: DEH investigator Kelsey Hanley says,
commenting on the city destroying plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and issuing recalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try our best to work with them,
but mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabriel's doing his best to correct them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The DEH has issued nearly a hundred public
recalls for marijuana products,
[SPEAKER_02]: but virtually all of them are recalled
because of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laveau says, Buddies recall is the first
ever issued for mold or mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buddies now has until Sunday, July 31st to
contact business and medical patients with
[SPEAKER_02]: available contact information who
purchased Labodaga products in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: three months to advise them of the recall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are some photos and it
says, here are the pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are DEH photos of the now destroyed
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant, I cannot see through the
webbing to find where the plant is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one just looks like they put a
plastic bag right over the plant and then
[SPEAKER_02]: just filled the plastic bag with spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: This next picture has got so much spider
mite webbing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like cotton.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one shows, that was a nice plant
until it got fucking riddled with mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decently, they just don't know how to take
care of pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at this powdery mildew,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is very sparse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very, very branchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very beefy, but the powdery
mildew looks just like a powdered donut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks like you dunked this fucker
in sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's all the pictures in this
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you bought anything at
Buddies, I highly recommend that you go
[SPEAKER_02]: back and exchange that or just return it,
get your money back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you just bought one gram and it's
far away, just fucking throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make yourself sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll probably gross yourself out when
you hear those spider mite eggs popping in
[SPEAKER_02]: there anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't want to dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we don't see a lot more of this
crap in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if anybody out there runs a
commercial grow, a marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: division regulated grow, and you're having
problems with powdery mildew, spider
[SPEAKER_02]: mites, fungus gnats, almost anything,
myself and a couple of friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: we know how to get rid of the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give you a little bit of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't charge you anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we need to do a full-on consultation,
we'll set up an appointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody will come to your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll tell you what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may take a little bit to schedule
somebody, but we're here to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of this can be handled through some
emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need help, see, I'd rather just
help you get rid of this shit so we can
[SPEAKER_02]: quit destroying and recalling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you need help with it, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're in a home grow,
whatever, you got problems, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a lot of episodes on pest
prevention and pest management and powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew management, but it gets different
when you're on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a giant grow and you're
getting problems, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not even waste time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that are approved by the Colorado
Marijuana Enforcement Division and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Department of Agriculture that
you can apply to your plants to keep away
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early in the phase or early in veg or
before a flower, you can use a product
[SPEAKER_02]: called, I'm trying to remember the name,
Banish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banish is oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banish also has a buddy product called
Smite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smite's for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banish is for mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are both oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not apply them with the lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will burn the fuck out of your plants
if you spray them and have lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you turn the lights off if you
use Smite or Banish.
[SPEAKER_02]: In flower, for powdery mildew,
I recommend Xerotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Xerotal smells like hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't leave a smell on your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't leave any residue on the
plants, but it does destroy powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: on contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will dissolve the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will stop the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a couple applications, you will
destroy it, and then you'll rinse it right
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can mix Xerotal with a product called
Cease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cease is a beneficial bacteria in a
carrier agent, and it smells like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you mix the Xerotal and you mix
the Cease together, the Cease is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the only bacterias that the Xerotal will
not kill, so they will not destroy the
[SPEAKER_02]: other product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can mix the Xerotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do Xerotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much Xerotal do you want to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say 35 milliliters of Xerotal per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get your gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add 35 mills of Xerotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then add 45 milliliters of Cease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stir the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put in a nice squirt of Cocoa Wet or some
sort of wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then just douse the plants with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave the lights off while you douse it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the plants dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn the lights back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: After one or two applications three days
apart, you should at least knock down the
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more application about three or four
days later, you won't have powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Xerotal and Cease, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anybody I said that because
those are trade secrets in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want you guys having powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how important it is to me,
all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Also try to figure out why you're getting
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there too much moisture in the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there not enough airflow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have too many plants crammed
together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you need to do more defoliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes time to harvest,
you don't have to take off any fan leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've already defoliated them
throughout the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: About a week before harvest, I'll go
through and pull off every other leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been left and then by harvest time,
they're naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just don't be afraid to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to apply the proper
fungicides at the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to get rid of your
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you can apply the Xerotal and
the Cease mix very late in flower up to
[SPEAKER_02]: like the last week of bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be just fine because the
Xerotal evaporates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kills what it needs to kill and then it
evaporates or dissipates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cease, I would cut that out maybe one
or two weeks before fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will not leave a flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't leave any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just apply it carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it time to dry before you turn on the
lights and have plenty of airflow in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room until harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a whole lot of talk from one
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have more stuff planned for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not want to just do the whole
episode on this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab of this Screamin'
Tangerine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to drink a little bit of water
and get my voice corrected and then I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be right back with more podcasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fulfilled all of my promises.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drank water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took dabs and I am back for more
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to some
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how much I should say,
but a friend of mine was here a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: ago and they visited and they left me some
strain specific CBD Terp sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some granddaddy perp CBD Terp
sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge fan of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD does not do a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there are patients out there
that should be smoking the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do not waste it, but this stuff
tastes fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This granddaddy perp CBD Terp sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend that if you're looking for
something with delicious flavor and a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: mellow calming high, this shit is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if I should say your name or
where it came from and you understand why,
[SPEAKER_02]: but huge thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promised more podcasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to some emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love answering emails from listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a question, that you
would like me to answer, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I will read your email on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep saying I've got a stack of emails
to get through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been printing them out and I'm trying
to get through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's cut the chit chat and get right
to an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is from a person who doesn't say
if I should use their name or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to get them in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to call you AL.
[SPEAKER_02]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started using Veg Bloom, Shine,
Push, and Plus Life on your
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things in here I want
to address.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recommend Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Shine, Push, and Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very simple program, although I
would definitely recommend adding things
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an experienced grower and you
want to push your garden, there are things
[SPEAKER_02]: you can add to it and it will not mess you
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to add carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I find that I need a little bit
of cow mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're using mills as your base,
I think your plants are going to be really
[SPEAKER_02]: happy with additions of Shine,
Push, and Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't switch, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're happy with what you're getting,
if you're getting pretty decent numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it is a little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: $500 right now, that's not a lot of money
if you're running a big crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're spending $500 on
nutrients, I'd imagine you're pulling a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty nice harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would stick with the mills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would basically, just like you did,
add the Shine, the Push, and the Plus Life
[SPEAKER_02]: to the mills recipe just like it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use the Veg Bloom base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use the additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use RO, don't use dirty,
don't use HD, don't use any of the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use your mills base.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is working, it's going to work
beautifully in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Shine will increase your resin
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might add a little bit more weight to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Push is definitely going to add vigor
to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Push makes the plants go much faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Plus Life is going, you're just going
to see more vigor, happier plants with a
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep using that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the mills.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you go on to say, anyway,
do you follow the recommendation to use
[SPEAKER_02]: just Shine at one gram a gallon from week
seven until flush?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always add stuff when I'm using Veg
Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, when I'm switching to the
flush phase that late, I increase my Shine
[SPEAKER_02]: to two grams per gallon and start reducing
my base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So reduce everything a little bit and then
use two grams of Shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it comes time to flush,
I'm in cocoa in my commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really easy to flush things out
and I don't feel like Shine builds up a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll use two grams of Shine plus a few
other things until about the last 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use Shine for the last feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it gets just a week of just
straight water, pHed, and then it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: flushed out real heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make sure there's plenty of runoff on
the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to get like 20, maybe 25% runoff
during flush time to make sure that that
[SPEAKER_02]: cocoa is really cleaning itself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at my photos on Instagram,
I'm irey underscore genetics, I-R-I-E
[SPEAKER_02]: underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see when the plants start showing
me that they've been properly flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I know my flush is on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also measuring the TD S,
the EC, and the PPMs and the pH that come
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the bottom of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know what we're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what we put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the two grams of Shine at the
end, right until flush time, I go,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do it through flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give myself a flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the Shine at two grams really
does something to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes them sparkly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes them beefy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would continue to add a base nutrient up
until flush time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, get your flush time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that seven to 14 day flush time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a hydro base, if you're in
cocoa, seven to 10 days is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a soilless mix, 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even go 21 days if you'd like to,
but you're missing opportunities in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one extra week of feeding is a missed
opportunity if you don't give it
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not go with just Shine to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would add some base nutrients,
whatever else you think you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a light bloom booster with the Shine
will really chunk it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you do give it the flush period
of just water at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess if you've got a nine week plant
and you're running hydro or cocoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: add the two grams of Shine up to week
eight, along with your base nutrient,
[SPEAKER_02]: along with the bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you might need Cal Mag at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed if you use too much Cal Mag
too late in flower, you can fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But use that stuff up to week seven or
eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then week nine should just be clean
water all flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to put the Shine in there
for the last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't find it necessary and I don't
want to take too long to taste it and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want my buds to burn weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got nine weeks, feed it for
seven, maybe give it Shine for week eight,
[SPEAKER_02]: then flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that does greatly depend on your
medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, like I said, any type of like a
hydro stuff, you can feed it up to that
[SPEAKER_02]: week before flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in soilless mix, give yourself
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to taste Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to taste Shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to taste any of these funky
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what's in Shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how long it'll stick around,
how heavy it is, how hard it is to flush
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it to make your buds burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't risk it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I hope I answered your question
clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I just sparked more questions,
feel free to email me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to reach me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, dude, thanks for the
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I can feel my throat
doing that thing where it starts getting
[SPEAKER_02]: scratchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 32 minutes into the podcast,
so I think I'm going to start wrapping up
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will make sure this gets up to Stitcher
properly Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make sure it's up on iTunes properly
on Monday morning.

there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post pictures from my personal grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post pictures from caregiver grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I definitely post a lot of pictures
from the commercial Grow at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead and check me out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all I've got for you this
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to Barry
Oh, and until next time, take a fat dab
[SPEAKER_02]: and give your mama a hug for me.
I'll see you next week.
