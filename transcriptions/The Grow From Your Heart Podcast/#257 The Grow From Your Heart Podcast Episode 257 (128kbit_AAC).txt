[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, if you're a new grower,

[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Kat, Coode and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: This episode is going to be coming out on
April 18th.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everybody is in the middle of a
happy, amazing celebration for the 420
[SPEAKER_06]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: With 420 being on a Wednesday,
I'm sure a lot of people started
[SPEAKER_06]: celebrating Friday evening, Friday at 420
when they got off work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're having a great 420 weekend,
wherever you are, whatever you're doing,
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you got a fat blunt roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're taking a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you've eaten some edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you're taking a fat bong rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: However you like to consume your cannabis,
I hope you are doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird without the cannabis
cup here in Denver this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's spread out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the party is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where everybody's going to
be, but I know where I am going to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be at the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to learn more about the Secret
Sesh hosted by my friend, Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also heard a rumor DJ Juggie would be
DJing the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check out Secret Sesh
Colorado on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot do anything to get you tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was lucky enough to get myself one
ticket because of course I am family.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got one for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot help you get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do anything for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Figure out how to find their Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are instructions on their
Instagram on how to try to get yourself
[SPEAKER_06]: into the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time this airs, it may be full.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk about something that I saw
on the cannabis just recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little bit related to the
cannabis cup not being here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a lot of people kind of
backed out on coming to Colorado without
[SPEAKER_06]: the giant cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to read an article from the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the headline goes like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cypress Hills cannabis cup concert just
moved to a much smaller venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sub headline says, I think that's
called the byline.
[SPEAKER_06]: That says fewer people will be getting
insane in the brain for 420 this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then this article is by Ricardo Baca of
course from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says, and the hits to the cannabis
cup in Colorado keep coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: First the US cannabis cup got booted from
its Denver adjacent home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's planned to stage a cup in
Southern Colorado fell apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then high times magazine's largest event
moved from Colorado for a greener,
[SPEAKER_06]: more lenient home in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now the cups loan Colorado event,
a high time sponsored concert with Cypress
[SPEAKER_06]: Hill, George Clinton, and others with a
cannabis cup award show tagged on is
[SPEAKER_06]: moving to a much smaller venue less than a
week before show time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even with, excuse me, let me try that
sentence again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even with the move to the smaller
venue, tickets are still available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of playing the 6,500 capacity
first bank center in Broomfield,
[SPEAKER_06]: the Cypress Hill concert and high times
award show is moving to the 1,700 capacity
[SPEAKER_06]: Ogden theater in Denver, according to
promoter AEG live.
[SPEAKER_06]: All tickets for the first bank center are
good for the Ogden and a limited number of
[SPEAKER_06]: tickets remain and are on sale now
according to a media release.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tickets are $65.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bills other acts are George Clinton
and parliament Funkadelic, Action Bronson,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Kronix.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, you've heard Kronix on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might write it down to end of the show
with Kronix.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put a little note on myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably end the podcast with Kronix.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of my favorite reggae artists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kronix with two X's at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great artist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going to go to this show you
guys, because it was at the first bank
[SPEAKER_06]: center.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a big event.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a big venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're up in the front of those big
venues, it's just a party and you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: even really get to see the concert.
[SPEAKER_06]: The artist I want to see is the least
known artist on the bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's going to play first.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll probably get like 30 minutes to
play.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a small venue like that,
it might be worth it for me to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're 6'5 and you got dreadlocks
down to your ass and a reggae man starts
[SPEAKER_06]: playing and you know all the words and you
walk from the front, people move the fuck
[SPEAKER_06]: out of your way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would just go right up front and
check out Kronix and then I'd be gone by
[SPEAKER_06]: the time I might check out Action Bronson
and Parliament Funkadelic.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'd stick around and see the
rest of it if I paid $65 for a ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just want to go see Kronix.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, it'd be a great time in that
little tiny club.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna continue with this article here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, so why didn't the event sell?
[SPEAKER_06]: Surely the lack of accompanying Cannabis
Cup Expo didn't help ticket sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with Snoop Dogg playing Fiddler's
Green, Wiz Khalifa and Lil Wayne playing
[SPEAKER_06]: the 420 rally, and Method Man and Redman
playing Red Rocks all in the same week,
[SPEAKER_06]: competition is no doubt fierce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this venue downsizing indicative of the
420 to come?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too early to say, but Colorado will
surely see fewer cannabis tourists this
[SPEAKER_06]: 420 because of the Cups move west.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of my friends that normally would
come out to Colorado for the 420 weekend
[SPEAKER_06]: from California, from Oregon, from
Washington, from Michigan, from all over
[SPEAKER_06]: the damn place, from North Carolina,
they are not coming out because there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of vendors that I'd like
to hang out with that probably I will not
[SPEAKER_06]: see this year because we usually bump into
each other either at the Cannabis Cup or
[SPEAKER_06]: age.
[SPEAKER_06]: So unless they're at age in the winter or
the fall time, I will not see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Oil Slick crew,
Handmade crew, the Hitman Glass crew,
[SPEAKER_06]: Task and Highly Educated, everybody that
shows up at all the events.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one group in my head that I'm
thinking of that I cannot think of,
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B and the No Goo crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: How did I forget about those guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: See all those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to miss seeing them at the Cup
this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B, I hear you'll be on the road
with the Goo Mobile.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: HapCant, Jules, all kinds of folks that
I'm not going to get to see because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's no Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm just ranting and screaming
about not getting a Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like a little bitch suddenly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll quit whining about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: This concert, you guys, it sounds like a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've moved it to the small venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did put out a press release and
it says, you cannot medicate in this
[SPEAKER_06]: facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there will be no ganja smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they say.
[SPEAKER_06]: They always say that kind of shit at these
events.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this venue is tiny and they can see
you from all angles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: If one person starts puffing and then two
people start and then the whole place is
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking, they can't kick everybody out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, you never know what
they're going to try to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to say no smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll probably just let you do it in
there anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm burping while I'm recording a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_06]: 23 flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, that was my news
article.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to read any more news in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go ahead and close that web browser
and we will go ahead and focus on some
[SPEAKER_06]: emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did an episode about listener emails and
that spawned more emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody sent me a message about a
probiotic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned that I like to consume
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like kombuchas and fermented products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're good for digestion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some stomach problems, which is
part of why I have a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll talk a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody really wants to hear
about my medical conditions, but my
[SPEAKER_06]: stomach is messed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wrecked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to take probiotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me feel like my food digest
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me feel like my body's better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think your gut health has a lot to do
with your mental health and your physical
[SPEAKER_06]: health.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it all starts in the gut.
[SPEAKER_06]: So probiotics and good food.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our listeners sent me an email
asking about a specific probiotic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to tell you the truth, I lost the
message.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot find where that message came in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't find it on the Facebook pages,
the Instagram, I can't find it in any of
[SPEAKER_06]: my emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: You asked if I had heard about a product
or if I am familiar with the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I've never heard of that
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I intended to save the message you sent
and go and research that product and tell
[SPEAKER_06]: you what I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, I don't know what happened
to the damn message.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you sent me that message,
let's do this easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me it again on an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way I'll find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will read your email again and I
will research that product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do apologize for losing the damn
email.
[SPEAKER_06]: It drove me crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent about two hours just searching for
that email.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, not all at one time,
but I put about two hours into looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: that thing probably, and I can't find the
message.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, our next email comes from,
I'm opening the message right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: This message came from a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if he wants me to say his
name, so I'm not gonna, but it says,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a new listener to the show and I gotta
say I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very thankful for the wealth of
information you provide and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledgeable guests you bring on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am listening from another state at the
moment, but have plans on moving to
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado soon to get involved in the
industry any way I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I listened to the episode about the MED
badges and I just had a few more
[SPEAKER_06]: questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have your med badge, does that mean
you can go into a medical dispensary as a
[SPEAKER_06]: customer to buy products as well?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is that a different car?
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that makes sense, but thanks again
for everything and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting you one day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to meeting you too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we get to take some fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully smoke some flowers together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see what kind of flowers
you are getting in your location and I'll
[SPEAKER_06]: show you what kind of flowers we've got
here and we can smoke down together.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a new listener.
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage you to go back and listen to a
few of the older episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a new listener, listen to,
I think it's 50, 55, then there's an
[SPEAKER_06]: episode about scheduling your growth,
scheduling a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's episodes about building your
garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I strongly recommend listening to some of
those more educational, in-depth,
[SPEAKER_06]: informative episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did you say here?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're very thankful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely very welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your main question is, the MED badge,
does it work like a Colorado red card or a
[SPEAKER_06]: medical marijuana recommendation?
[SPEAKER_06]: The red cards are now purple, which is a
drastic change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: The main answer is no.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Colorado MED badge does not work the
same as your Colorado medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot shop in a medical marijuana
facility just because your badge.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not work like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your badge will get you some discounts at
other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you shop at a dispensary, it also gets
you into some of the smoke lounges for
[SPEAKER_06]: free.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that if I wear my badge to the
Canna Canyon, Camille does not charge me
[SPEAKER_06]: to get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Camille has never charged me.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's ever charged me to get into the
Canna Canyon because I do advertising and
[SPEAKER_06]: I show love to the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you have an MED badge, they will
not charge you to get into the Canna
[SPEAKER_06]: Canyon is where most people would pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: $25 at the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are some perks of having the
badge, just some industry perks and
[SPEAKER_06]: friendly things that come, but it does not
work as a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_06]: To get a medical marijuana recommendation,
to get into a medical marijuana facility,
[SPEAKER_06]: you do need to see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no doctor involved in the MED
paperwork and questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I will mention, if you do have a
Colorado medical marijuana card,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can use that card in Las Vegas in the
state of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevada has medical marijuana and they do a
reciprocal program where other states
[SPEAKER_06]: cards work there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're a tourist and you are in Las
Vegas, or if you're in the state of
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevada, before you go to the bunny ranch,
you can stop and grab yourself some ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big up to Nevada for being a
reciprocating state on the medical
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana recommendation cards.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please send me more questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do appreciate the listener interaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got another email.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_06]: From a friend of ours and he asked me
basically what stops people or is it
[SPEAKER_06]: possible for somebody to buy a package of
seeds and grow some plants out of it and
[SPEAKER_06]: then call those plants something else and
then enter cannabis cups or other
[SPEAKER_06]: competitions with something that they
claim is something they bred, but is
[SPEAKER_06]: actually something that they have
purchased from a seed bank or they got a
[SPEAKER_06]: clone from somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the answer to that is nothing is
stopping that other than our community and
[SPEAKER_06]: people's morals.
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, if I sold you seeds of any
strain that I bred, you could take them
[SPEAKER_06]: home.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could grow them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could find the keeper.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could wait three or four months until
everybody forgot that you had that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you could say, Hey, look what I
created.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could name it your whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got arrowhead water bottles in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to see, you could say you
bred your arrowhead and you can call it
[SPEAKER_06]: this arrowhead and you could enter it into
cannabis cups and you're going to fool a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of people, but you won't fool the
people that are really into the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: that know what strain is what strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are guys when we go to cannabis
cups, you can smoke a flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody will pass you a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of these guys will say,
Oh, is that Aaron's OG Kush that he grew
[SPEAKER_06]: over there at the clinic?
[SPEAKER_06]: And people know what these flowers taste
like, look like, smell like we're catching
[SPEAKER_06]: on all the stuff that stands out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are very few things that stand out
enough to be cup winners.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when we smoke these things,
we notice them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We remember the flavor, remember the high,
then we smoke it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's familiar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you try to pass it off as something
else, somebody in the circle is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: notice, but honestly, 90% of the people in
the world would be fooled.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will believe you, but the only thing
stopping you from doing it is having some
[SPEAKER_06]: morals and not being a cannabis dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember the year exactly,
but I do remember that several years back
[SPEAKER_06]: there was a person who bought a bunch of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember where he purchased the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he bought it from a coffee shop in
Amsterdam or from a grower in Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_06]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he entered it into the cannabis cup in
Amsterdam, the original cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he walked around and persuaded people
at the cup to vote for him as the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of bought votes from people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a legitimately won cannabis cup,
but these guys won a cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of stole a cup from DNA genetics
by buying another professional grower's
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers and putting their name on it and
marketing it as their name to create their
[SPEAKER_06]: new seed company, to make hype on their
seed company.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of the people, most of the folks
in Amsterdam knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that were voting for them were
mostly tourists and people that were not
[SPEAKER_06]: really familiar with the weed game.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the people that, all the local
Amsterdam had smoked it and they were
[SPEAKER_06]: like, Hey, this is whatever's haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew whose haze it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew exactly, but these guys called
it uki kabuki and they fucking won a
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis cup by stealing a strain,
renaming it and entering it into the cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then persuading other people to vote
for it by kind of buying votes,
[SPEAKER_06]: by giving them weed, by talking to them,
by kissing their asses.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually kind of a documentary on
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to Google it and look for it,
hold on and go find the name for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, I did a little bit of
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I can find is some stuff on ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check out icmag.com,
join the forum.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says in 2007, Hager produced a reality
TV show based around the High Times
[SPEAKER_06]: offices titled High Times Office.
[SPEAKER_06]: The show's 12th episode culminated in the
20th cannabis cup where Big Apple Seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: from Brooklyn, New York won a blind taste
test against DNA seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was judged by Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was later revealed in High Times that
Doc and Dom, the owners of Big Apple
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds, were actors and their entry uki
kabuki.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uki kabuki was actually Neville Hayes
purchased in Amsterdam from a pot broker
[SPEAKER_06]: with a good nose for good weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was posted up on ICMAG from a
poster calls himself Saluki.
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like he's well known on this
place here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just read part of your post.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even know who I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who you are, but you just got
to shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a legend of uki kabuki and how
that went.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot of rumors on how that
went down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just what I found on this one
forum.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of brings back a lot of memories.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the original question was, can somebody
steal a strain and rename it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this example, these people didn't even
grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They bought it and then entered it into
the cannabis cup and it was Neville Hayes,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is always going to win.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the best strains on the
planet when grown properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right back with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I am back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get too far, I want to give a
huge shout out to our friends at Nugs in
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nugs 303, Denver's newest dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check them out at 3899
Quentin Street in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday through Sunday, 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: to 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are currently only a medical cannabis
facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the future, they will have a
recreational side of the building.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will be able to serve iRegenetics
products to the entire recreational
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is coming soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big shout out to our friends at Nugs in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you follow their Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is nugs.303.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got another email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is a question about seed pack
labeling and flowering times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're looking at seed packs
online, you look at a package and it will
[SPEAKER_06]: say flowering time, usually 56 to 63 days
is what most packages will say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some will say 60 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully they're writing the truth on
there, but usually it's eight to nine
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks and they'll indicate that by the
number of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what that number is, is the flowering
time, unless you've got auto flowering
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got auto flower plants,
this doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: This does not apply.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you've got regular photo period
plants, this is what that number means.
[SPEAKER_06]: When a breeder labels his package of seeds
and it says that this plant takes whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: eight to nine weeks or 56 to 63 days to
finish, that is the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how long that plant is going to
take to reach full maturity from the time
[SPEAKER_06]: you initiate the flowering period.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is when the very, from the very
first day you turn that timer to 1212 and
[SPEAKER_06]: the lights go from 12 hours on to 12 hours
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is now day one of that phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: That nine week period that's written on
the package has nothing to do with your
[SPEAKER_06]: veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can veg those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can sprout them as seedlings.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get them like two inches tall and
then you can flower them if you want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that could be 20 days or you can sprout
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can veg them for 12 weeks and take a
million clones and then flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what you're going to do with
the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: The breeder doesn't know either.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the only one that knows what you're
going to do with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the veg time is as long as you want it
to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flowering time is what is indicated on
the package and it begins the day you turn
[SPEAKER_06]: those lights to 1212.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that breeder pack says that the
plants are going to take 56 to 63 days,
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually recommend going the full 63 days
unless it's completely obvious that that
[SPEAKER_06]: plant is going to be done earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of course some phenotypes are
going to finish sooner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are going to finish a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to push them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to see what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes a plant won't start putting on
its bulk until the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be cutting yourself out of some
weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be cutting yourself out of
potency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes those plants will just throw on
a whole another layer of trichomes right
[SPEAKER_06]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know what you might be missing
if you cut down too early.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the package says that it could go
nine weeks, let it go nine full weeks on
[SPEAKER_06]: the first run.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then hopefully you've got clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you get to pick your favorite
phenotype out of that seed pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to run it again and then you get
to dial in exactly how many days to flower
[SPEAKER_06]: that plant for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes your first run with the plant is
just an experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to see what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my take on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The time indicated on the pack is how long
the plant will flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep that in mind when you're
purchasing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking for a reputable seed
vendor in the United States, I would
[SPEAKER_06]: recommend TheDankTeam.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: The D-A-N-K-T-E-A-M.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: TheDankTeam.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got things from Gage Green
Genetics, Sour Seeds, Mile High,
[SPEAKER_06]: Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a lot of great stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may even have some iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what's available.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to go and take a look for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move on to another question.
[SPEAKER_06]: This question actually came from a friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Los.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a varietal.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a plant that goes around our
region that is a sour diesel clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it is grown properly,
you cannot keep it in a baggie,
[SPEAKER_06]: in a jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't put it in a baggie inside of a
jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't hide this weed from anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put it in a baggie, in a jar and in
your car, you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can smell this sour diesel outside of
the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: This shit is potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some super loud weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: This shit is crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I give it to a lot of my friends,
they cannot grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I myself cannot grow this strain worth a
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know three or four people that grow this
strain fucking amazingly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_06]: The calyxes swell up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets that gassy fuel funk smell to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So me being the inquisitive guy that I am,
I know a few guys that grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I asked them, I was like, hey,
how do you grow that sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_06]: And all three of the people that grow it
successfully have told me that it grows in
[SPEAKER_06]: some type of a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what that leads me to think,
these guys, myself included, that are
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to grow this cultivar, this clone,
this varietal, this plant, this strain in
[SPEAKER_06]: a soil or soilless mix, we're not going to
have much success because this plant was
[SPEAKER_06]: probably phenol hunted from a pack of
seeds by somebody that grows in hydro.
[SPEAKER_06]: This plant was selected for a hydroponic
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody growing it,
and this could be wrong, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_06]: most of the people growing it in soil are
ever going to bring out that flavor and
[SPEAKER_06]: aroma that my friends in the hydroponic
system are getting because I feel like
[SPEAKER_06]: some plants like hydro and some plants
like soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a perfect example of
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: The grower that found this plant probably
grows hydro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he thought, look at this amazing plant
that I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he gave it to all of us soil
growers and we're just frustrated.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so angry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that some strains, and I keep
saying all these different words,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're known as different things in
different circles.
[SPEAKER_06]: People will call them varietals and you'll
hear cultivar also.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say strains or clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some strains or clones or plants are just
not simply going to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that if you took one of my
soil plants and you tried to grow that in
[SPEAKER_06]: a hydroponic system, you may not have as
stellar results as you would have in soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just some plants are going to like
some things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I think is going on with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to Lose for asking me that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of told him the same thing and he
scratched his head and looked at me like I
[SPEAKER_06]: was a genius.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I would share that with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that's enough emails for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a couple more emails that I will
read on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like if I get into one of them
today, it will be way too long of a show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, there is one email I can
definitely reply to right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody sent me an email asking about
cannabis and sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, can you talk about cannabis and
sex?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is my take on cannabis and sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody else also sent me an email about
cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to know about the pros and
cons and the advantages and disadvantages
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis use during pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I am not well educated in that
subject.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am going to do some research and I
will try to get you an episode that
[SPEAKER_06]: features a little bit about cannabis and
pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get that out to you in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to do it soon because it sounds like
somebody might be pregnant right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that goes well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope mama is happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope the baby's healthy and I hope daddy
is doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That pretty much wraps up this episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, if you see me at the Secret
Setch, please introduce yourself,
[SPEAKER_06]: shake my hand, say hello, give me a fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to meet you.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you then.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys got super high.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, this is a great episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am joined by my good buddy, Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox, and we talk a little bit about CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, White Mike was on the show,
but he had to run halfway through the
[SPEAKER_06]: show.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a really long podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to ramble on too long,
so I'm going to let the music play for a
[SPEAKER_06]: second, and when we get back, we will be
joined by White Mike and Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, take a fat dab, sit tight,
and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking terrible at rolling.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we are back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting at the table with our good
buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, sitting across from me, welcome to
my house, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting across from me at the table is
Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox from Run CBD, slash Fox Tracks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the humble abode, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to finally be here, neighbor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to have you here, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: You live in Pueblo now.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that feel?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it here, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to have you here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to have both of you guys here
on the podcast at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to meet you, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: He calls you White Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's never going to be White Mike forever,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell who knows me strictly from
the podcast because that's where that name
[SPEAKER_01]: exists for the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just came out as White Mike on the show
one day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's White Mike for life for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag White Mike for life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting some echo.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that echo from?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it under control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are not sound guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I asked anybody else what
the echo was from.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because we turned up the bass on Mike
because Mike's got a head cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you get well, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Working on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fancy didn't say you didn't hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kabuki's over here rolling a blunt,
and Mike was quite impressed by your
[SPEAKER_06]: rolling skills.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way better than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a bunch of dry sieve frosting on my
fingers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tearing the leaves apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually I'll do a better job.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the episode after 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do a little bit of a 420
recap.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about where everybody was,
what they all did on 420, and we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to talk about some bullshit that happened
on 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, what'd you do on 420, my friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really low key 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the day off, but I also didn't have
childcare that day, so I hung out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: kid until about six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran around town and picked up a whole
bunch of marijuana products that don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: you high and ran those up to a friend in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to your friend in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we are able to take good care of
him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Working on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag fuck cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your CBD, your 420 was spent... You
guys, you may have to excuse us.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be some stutters and some
stumbles and some randomness in this
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many giant dabs have been taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many giant dabs have happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two e-nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: A relatively small amount of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: A short amount of time, lots of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two e-nails on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a beautiful rig from our friends
at Bear Mountain Studios.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Evan and Cass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to those kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met them at the Cannabis Cup a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mike hung out with the kid on 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask Kabuki what he did,
but he's taken a glob over here of some
[SPEAKER_06]: rosin, so we're going to have to give him
a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a week's worth of Mike dabs
right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to change that tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to clear this head cold up and
give him a variety of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen what happens when we give Mike
too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: He turns different colors, has to run to
the bathroom and hide for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's nice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my friend Kabuki, what did you do on
420, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: My 420 was pretty low key-ish.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, my girl's mom was in town,
so we just kind of kicked it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is your girl's mom a smoker?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she's totally pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to moms that smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to moms that support cannabis,
even if they don't do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then I sponsored the 5280 Glass
Showcase, which was really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I heard, it went on pretty long
from like four to midnight, and I caught
[SPEAKER_07]: it towards the end of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I showed up at eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where was that happening?
[SPEAKER_07]: At Native Hotel in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: N-A-T-I-V.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and it was cool how they handled that
because they had two buses outside where
[SPEAKER_07]: any dabbing or smoking or any consumption
was done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, though obviously we couldn't do
anything, you know, in the hotel,
[SPEAKER_07]: they had made space and a con for people
that were getting medicated, and they
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't fucked with it all night,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a shout out to Adam Dunn
and his crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were the first people I ever saw use
rented buses.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had tour buses for bands,
and we parked them outside of the Fox or
[SPEAKER_06]: the Oriental Theater one night.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, you can't medicate in
here, but this is a VIP bus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were able to dab in there because
it's private property.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how that worked out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it was a cool event.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposing a local glass artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people showed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of friendly faces.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was super fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: After that, I wanted to see some good
friends of mine downtown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wanted to eat some pizza, some mac and
cheese pizza from Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, I can't remember the name of this
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, mac and cheese pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking like, you know, because the white
cheese sauce from the Mac and New York
[SPEAKER_07]: style bread on the... It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you do that at the start of the
show?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I wonder how much pizza was sold on
420.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I want that so bad right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I want to say a million dollars for
the pizza, at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much pizza is sold in
Denver on a daily basis, but I actually
[SPEAKER_06]: know a guy that works at a pizza place who
said that the owner of his pizza place
[SPEAKER_06]: almost had to close the business because
they weren't surviving here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then cannabis was legalized and now
their business is thriving and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: opening more locations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, shout out to cannabis and pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Pueblo for smoking more weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, more weed than... So, you've been
all over the place, Fox.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have stuff to talk about on this
podcast, but we're going to get ADD today
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of good shit comes out in
these random conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, always.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you find smokes the most,
Nerv?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we talking Colorado only or are we
talking in general?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anywhere you've been, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_07]: California is interesting because I was in
the Bay and Northern Cali and it's very
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis friendly up there as far as the
cities go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lifestyle culture is very cannabis
integrated.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as of lately, Colorado within the last
year, I feel, has really stepped their
[SPEAKER_07]: shit up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to say there's so many fucking
people that blow it down heavy down here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, between Denver and Pueblo,
there's a lot of heavy heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me reiterate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: From the mountains up North to Pueblo,
there's a lot of really heavy heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I still think that people in Colorado
really throw it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's time for the city and our culture
to catch up with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, shout out to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, we smoke a lot of herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you guys do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, hey, from Miami to California
to New York to Oregon to Washington,
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, all these places are different and
stuff, but Colorado is still the bedrock.
[SPEAKER_07]: People always look to us regardless of
whether we want to admit it or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's just about, you can accept that
it's not about wearing a badge or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything, but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, embrace it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, do you have a good 420, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was super nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Minus the drive from Pueblo to Denver to
Pueblo on the same night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the same thing on 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a bad drive that night,
but there was a lot of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which luckily, I didn't hear about any of
our friends or anyone in close relation of
[SPEAKER_07]: our circles being fucked with in that
sense, but- I know a couple of folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: got pulled over, but they didn't get cited
for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got pulled over and sent on
their way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's nice, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: At least someone got fucked with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was taking a hit off this blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it looks delicious and I'd love to hit
it, but not with the cold, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was your favorite piece of glass you
saw at this glass showcase, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Calm at Combo on Instagram,
Calvin does the birds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of Weezy's favorite glass
artists also.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's my favorite sculpture artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, his husband.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love his birds.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But him and Alex Tuba, who does those
Warlock pendies, they just went to Japan
[SPEAKER_07]: and the fucking collabs that they did with
Team Japan, the Aquarius, the dudes that
[SPEAKER_07]: do all the dot work and all that are just-
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blew my mind, literally.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one bird with a Mandela dot work
on the stomach and it was just like,
[SPEAKER_07]: the detail is insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have gotten lost in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those pieces that I probably
wouldn't even use.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would, but you know- Do you know
what the price tag was on that piece?
[SPEAKER_07]: 15K on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you talk Team Japan and anything
calm, it's going to be pricey,
[SPEAKER_07]: but holy shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful artwork.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a lot of other great artists
there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: John Taylor made like this with- Shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy's coming up quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He made the AK replica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know he's very adamant about gun stuff
and stuff, and you can see it in his glass
[SPEAKER_07]: work because the detail to the piece is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did it with Pogo Glass, who he's a
great friend too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that guy kills it in his own regard.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Lunchbox Mechanic, Matt Pinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was there doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of shit there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got there pretty late and it was mostly
about just seeing people, because I hadn't
[SPEAKER_07]: gone into Denver almost two, three months
on any event like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was nice just catching up with all
friendly faces from up north who came into
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver from the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the fun part of these events.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the art was just a bonus.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird not having a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually the cup is where I see everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say as much shit as people talk
about the cup or whatever gripes they have
[SPEAKER_07]: against the competition side of it or
whatever it is, you can definitely feel
[SPEAKER_07]: the myth and the mystic presence of that
event.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: People had their opinions about it and
whatever you thought of it, it was just a
[SPEAKER_06]: great place to meet up with everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would see everybody from Addison DeMora
to Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox to just my random local friends there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would all get along and hang out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would dab with Danny Danko, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd just hang out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be such a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's nowhere else you can go and
see that many people.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at the same place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And though it's cool because now I
unfortunately missed Secret Sessions,
[SPEAKER_07]: this year, so I'm glad that I've been told
that they're going to be planning it for
[SPEAKER_07]: the next one because we'll be out there
hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of events were planned.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like of the fucking,
of the five to seven events that I heard
[SPEAKER_07]: of, three to four of them, all but two,
and the showcase got raided.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cops did shut down almost all
consumption events.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I was just laughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: My laughter was because I tried to pick up
a water bottle off of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an oil slick pad and there was so
much oil on the oil slick pad that the
[SPEAKER_06]: water bottle just stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was pretty damn funny if you heard
my goofy laughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's what that was.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what that was all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were doing a magic trick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I, I accidentally, I'm a magician
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you mentioned Secret Sessions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's obviously where I was for 421.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm laughing at you guys complaining about
your driving.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work in Colorado Springs for 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: I woke up, I live in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I woke up, got stoned as shit,
drove up to Colorado Springs to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: The boss called me at two 20, or called me
at two o'clock and he said, be ready for
[SPEAKER_06]: two 20 dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pick you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to lunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: We came back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to work for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: My alarm went off, said, Hey, it's four o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went and took another break,
celebrated 420, took about a half gram
[SPEAKER_06]: dab, went back to work, came home.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next day I went to secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went Pueblo Springs, Pueblo woke up,
drove to Pueblo and drove to Springs on
[SPEAKER_06]: 421, handled the garden, the stuff that
needed to be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drove to secret sesh in Denver,
raged secret sesh from about four in the
[SPEAKER_06]: afternoon until about one in the morning,
dabbing with all kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took 11 grams with me and I think I
smoked seven of them at the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus whatever other people were dabbing me
out with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you gave me a dab at secret sesh,
shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a huge good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a huge list of people I want to
give shout outs to from that, but I wanted
[SPEAKER_06]: to talk about a couple of the things
first.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what I was saying,
but I drove back from the secret sesh to
[SPEAKER_06]: work to check on the plants again,
because I didn't get everything done in
[SPEAKER_06]: the first half of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I knew the plants weren't ready for
more water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I gave them some time to chill and went
back and took care of them again later.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I showed up to the garden at like three
in the morning, took care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, shout outs to you getting your shit
done, regardless of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: our holiday, which, you know, regardless
of, you know, it's great for the patients,
[SPEAKER_07]: but when you're in the industry or you
have, you know, work to tend to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to balance the both, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to extend that shout out
beyond myself to everybody, all the kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of soldiers that have a garden that when
you can see who it is, we'll be having a
[SPEAKER_06]: good ass time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And six or eight people look at their
watches and you see them go, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to go do something at the garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all just take off, go to our separate
groves.
[SPEAKER_06]: That blunt is sticky, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a bunch of frogs in the inside
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the whole reason for the sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I of course went to the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to everybody at the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a long list of people here that I
want to give shout outs to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I want to give a huge shout out
to my boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: John Hunt, the grimy motherfucking Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag I know Hunt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody was trying to hit me up,
hit up Hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody was hitting up Adam Mill,
trying to get into the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, there's one way to get into the
secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go to the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to follow the rules and either
you get in or you don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys were very apparent about the
rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't, I can't help it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were quick to respond.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt can't help you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam Mill can't help you unless you're
already in our crew and on the list of
[SPEAKER_06]: promoters or vendors or sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to pay and you got to pay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to try to get in like everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no fancy treatment here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was even there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Adam Mill, of course,
for hosting the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.

[SPEAKER_06]: Sad that I missed him, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's another guy.

Rock's material.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I've met Juggie one other
time, but it was more crowded.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was actually was blessed enough to
be hanging out in the green room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a little green room past this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were all hanging out in the green room
and Juggie is just a cool ass level headed
[SPEAKER_06]: dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's mellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's calm.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a fucking classy adult.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to that dude.

[SPEAKER_06]: I had never met Nick Mailman until Secret
Sash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick's the homie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that guy's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why haven't I met that guy before?
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be friends, Nick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hang on.

Wellness that's known as Nugs in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool to finally meet him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a shout out to Tony from LA who works
the camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like a dick smoking this in front
of a white mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not big on the blunts anyway,
so you're not hurting his feelings too
[SPEAKER_06]: much.
Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy them, but yeah, don't feel bad
about leaving me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad about risk and getting you guys
sick at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to join the blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have that back, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me give a shout out to Official Tim
also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I do Official Tim?

[SPEAKER_06]: Huge shout out to all of the seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a bunch of them?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a bag of seeds that was gifted to
me from one seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one breeder gave me this bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just imagine what my backpack looks
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gifted seeds from, this is from,
I want to make sure I get it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Concentrated genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to them because they hooked you
the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys aren't in the room to see it,
but homie pulled out a big, a big,
big bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call that a quarter pound bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a quarter pound bag for sure.

[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of us, we're going to go get Thai
food.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll invite more potheads.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go have a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's all the shout outs I need
to give.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I skipped you, I fucking apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I smoked like six or seven
grams of shatter at the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate everybody that hung out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made some new friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know David from rare was there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary saw, dude, I know your name and I
can't think of it right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary's motivation, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Brett, Brett, Brett's the homie.
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad he was revving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a, he's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good ass dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really cool to meet all those
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry if I didn't give you a shout out
because like I said, we got dabbed the
fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to run to the green room and get
snacks one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I am so high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to go to the green room and get
snacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I abused the shit out of that green room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever, you're, you have a booth and
stuff at the cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever get to where you just need a
fucking break?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, I love everybody and this is
fun, but I just want to go not talk to
[SPEAKER_06]: people and just not, not be here for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't get that on a year that you want
a cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the green room was an amazing place to
have.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never had that before.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like snacks and a chill place.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but you're totally, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to sit down for like 20 minutes and
not like do anything while I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I had my girlfriend at the time
helping and a friend from Miami and yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so tired after day three.
[SPEAKER_06]: That cannabis cup was the first time you
and I ever shook hands and met face to
[SPEAKER_06]: face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you gave me one of those banana bars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I ended up getting some Arise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some Arise seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the black cherry cam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that's what you asked for specific.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yes, your black cherry cam.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the whole reason I've been
following you for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to mention this while we're on this
topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I love the support.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the cravings for my seeds,
but I cannot ship you seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all you guys that are emailing me,
they're hitting me up through the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to get you some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that you might be able to get
seeds is to go to the dankteam.com and see
[SPEAKER_06]: what's available.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may have Irene genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can recommend to you Mile High,
La Plata, Sin City.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can highly recommend Rare Dankness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cali Connection has a lot of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot send you seeds, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just how it is in my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ditto.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come here and I can give you some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I sent out a bunch of free CBD
seeds, but you know, they're all like,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's all pretty much a verified habit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did it for a very short amount of
time where I was like, yeah, I'm sending
[SPEAKER_07]: out 32 to ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and then I had to do it again
for that same reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need CBD seeds, come to Colorado
and Fox and I will hook you up with
[SPEAKER_06]: handfuls of free CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, but there's, you know,
like you said, Rare Dankness, La Plata
[SPEAKER_07]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mile High, Canned Adventure, Sour Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all good friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Nice from old school back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually grabbing a big chunk of mango
hay seeds because I just came knowing to
[SPEAKER_07]: me that that was the strain that I grew up
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have a similar friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's just trying to give me mango
hay seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to that person.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to be public.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to get my hands on these and,
you know, get back to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find that what I grew up on, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we talked about the events that we did
attend and then you kind of hinted at
[SPEAKER_06]: events getting busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite a few.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Colorado Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Steve DeFino.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll get into that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's a good friend.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should get him on here to talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Colorado Cup was rated and I've
actually got a copy of the search warrant
[SPEAKER_06]: on my phone if we wanted to read it,
but I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we should delve into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be interesting actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: They claim to have found some drugs
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, in the DJ booth.
[SPEAKER_06]: They claim there was some drugs in the DJ
booth.
[SPEAKER_06]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also the DJ booth was the only room
without a camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's hard to say what happened
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so there was an event at a place
called Rigs R Us and it was the Colorado
[SPEAKER_06]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was an event similar to a cannabis
cup where people enter their strains of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, extracts, edibles, and cannabis
wares and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people judged them and they decided a
winner.
[SPEAKER_06]: On 420 at 3 p.m., the Denver City police
came in with bandanas on their faces and
[SPEAKER_06]: shotguns in their hands, kicked in the
front doors and started yelling,
[SPEAKER_06]: get out, get out, get out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And half of the people that were in there
thought the place was getting robbed
[SPEAKER_06]: because they did not announce that they
were police until everybody left and
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody was on the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then a uniformed officer walked in and
delivered a search warrant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: After everything was all... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody thought the place was getting
fucking robbed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a friend who was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: She sent me a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: She sent me a video from the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cops that first went in just looked
like thugs in dickies and combat boots and
[SPEAKER_06]: bandanas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were followed by armed cops who
were then followed by riot cops just to
[SPEAKER_06]: come shut down in illegal smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of peaceful fucking stoners.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They needed riot gear.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much of our tax money was that?
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually... Sounds like 60 grand from
what you just said.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were several MacBooks being used for
data entry for the cup that was happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these cops poured bottled water all
over the MacBooks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you fucking serious?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just dumped bottles of water over the
MacBooks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For no reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: Destruction of property.
[SPEAKER_06]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, those are some serious claims.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to my source on the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Denver PD doesn't have the cleanest
record for how they deal with...
[SPEAKER_07]: Public affairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to read any of the... I can
read you... Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were 38 charges filed against these
folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go find the message.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So while you find the message,
I'll delve into AJ Hashman a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, AJ?
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's the thing with AJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not one to talk shit or say
anything of anyone, but I'll tell you my
[SPEAKER_07]: first experience with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back last year, do you remember the Gypsy
Jane Fest?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did take it, but I remember seeing the
posts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a huge joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they got stooped to come in to do
whatever he did for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Half the artists didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: The company running it lied about ticket
sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of vendors got fucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people bought $40,000 booths and
recouped nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of that, it was like a three-day
event.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the second day, a lot of these
people's stuff got broken into,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the guys that came in to promote the
event and help build it, it all left and
[SPEAKER_07]: left everything high and dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So AJ's role in this was they had seeked
him out to do the judging portion of the
[SPEAKER_07]: edible competition and concentrate
competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what ended up happening was he took
like 17 grams or 14, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was over half an ounce of concentrate
from us and told us that no dispensaries
[SPEAKER_07]: would be entering and that it would just
be an independent thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we made the time, got some flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ran it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the case was, and it was okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But fuck, I can't remember the name of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: The clinic or someone who had just gone
rec came in and bought fucking ounces of
[SPEAKER_07]: this shit and turned in entry for every
category and just kind of voided
[SPEAKER_07]: everything he said.
[SPEAKER_07]: So on top of that, we found out that my
entry was never judged.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was a year ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's flash forward to Colorado Cup,
Steve Dufino.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his flour entry, he had two entries,
his Cheesequake, which I can personally
[SPEAKER_07]: say as an extractor, as a grower,
as a breeder, you know, he does great
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to extract it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to squish it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super terpy material.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He also entered your Heart of Gold,
which is a Golden Goat cross.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So very sativa dominant cross you would
say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the whole scheme of things,
you know, like you just said, they got
[SPEAKER_07]: raided.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve almost lost his possessions or
whatever the case was because of that
[SPEAKER_07]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He ended up getting it and they're giving
him shit or whatever the case was.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he didn't find out until a few days
later after they announced the winnings
[SPEAKER_07]: that his entries weren't even judged,
which is typical of something that AJ
[SPEAKER_07]: would do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now let's rewind a little bit again.
[SPEAKER_07]: He would do these things and promote these
events called Canterraves and whatever the
[SPEAKER_07]: case was.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't really around for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've just only heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the same similar thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wouldn't get permits for anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cops would constantly come to the
events.
[SPEAKER_07]: The vendors would get fucked because he
would collect money.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was charging more money for what he was
like, oh, if you want your entry tested,
[SPEAKER_07]: $40.
[SPEAKER_07]: What that actually cost is 25.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was actually skimming off the top of
every entry.
[SPEAKER_07]: That, you know, that was made on top of
what he was getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like, you know,
I can understand why someone would be
[SPEAKER_07]: upset.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve, our good friend, Steve was not too
happy when he heard that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was verified.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just feel like one people with that
kind of track record should just not do
[SPEAKER_07]: events.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have nothing ill to say about AJ,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking I'll smoke with you, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't say the same for Steve or some
of the other competitors.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you kind of fucked over.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that being said, me and Steve have been
talking about authenticity and competition
[SPEAKER_07]: and trying to do something more towards
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was a huge bust on their part of
the competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, yeah, I wish it hadn't gone
that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: When people told me about the Colorado
Cup, I asked who was throwing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I heard who it was, I kind of had to
pull from it, knowing that one,
[SPEAKER_07]: the cops who they get to get involved or
two, my entry is going to be taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it can just go to patients
if that's the case, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: why bother?
[SPEAKER_06]: So- So that reminds me that I did not do a
shout out to the venue where we held the
[SPEAKER_06]: secret session.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that I want to say the name
of the venue because we're going to do it
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's a secret, dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big shout out to the venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: That place is brad, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Word on the street is we're doing secret
session again in May.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a good chance that Rasta Jeff
will be the co-host because in June and
[SPEAKER_06]: July, I will be the host of the secret
session.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things go our way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might not be supposed to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So only listeners can know that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't tell anybody, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all a secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam and I are going to get together and
talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably be hosting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get ridiculous up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I found a list of, this is the
inventory that was confiscated by the
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver police.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are 20 articles, 20 items listed
on the front page.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says, number one, marijuana
concentrate in the basement storage area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, marijuana in the basement
office.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, marijuana concentrate in the
basement storage.
[SPEAKER_06]: They list marijuana concentrate,
marijuana concentrate, marijuana basement,
[SPEAKER_06]: suspected meth basement, marijuana
concentrate, basement, marijuana dab room,
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana concentrate, basement bar,
marijuana basement bar, marijuana cookies
[SPEAKER_06]: on the basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: This might have been someone's unknown.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably reclaiming their life.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to charge them for this too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that charge is very funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, unless it's AJ's ID in the DJ room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: The legal disclaimer, Ross and Jeff in the
Grow From Your Heart podcast has no
[SPEAKER_06]: evidence against AJ Hashman and any
wrongdoing.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all the opinions of Kabuki J
Fox.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all allegedly, whatever other
legal ground we have to cover there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: The same goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you my personal experience
with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in no way trying to- Mike just got a
phone call and says he has to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to press pause and I'm going
to check on my friend, make things are
[SPEAKER_06]: good, and we'll be right back with the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, folks, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it best.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, we're back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike had to take off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize for having to cut off the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike just had to give somebody an
unexpected ride, not an emergency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the little guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the prom went well, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where were we?
[SPEAKER_06]: We were kind of in the middle of
slandering AJ Hashman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, not really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expressing my views, which had
nothing to do with you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for letting me express them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I am expressing them on the behalf of
my friend Steve, who really feels like he
[SPEAKER_07]: got shafted.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just unfortunate, you know,
because I tried to warn him and him being
[SPEAKER_07]: a good person, tried to give him the
benefit of the doubt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hey, it's like chlamydia.
[SPEAKER_07]: You learn your lesson once with that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And AJ is just kind of like dealing with
him in a business sense is never a
[SPEAKER_07]: wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not looking to go back and get
burned twice.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you learn your lesson and that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give a shout out to Steve
DeFino.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve DeFino, if you'd like to come on the
podcast once again, we can meet up at the
[SPEAKER_06]: canyon.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can come to my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're in Colorado Springs,
so it may be easier for me to come to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should come down to Pueblo,
Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, either way, there's a third chair
now since Mike left.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Steve, you're invited.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Steve, I'd love to have you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got anything you'd ever like to
say, if you'd like to talk about the VFA,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you'd like to talk about events,
bro, this is partly your show as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got always got a welcome seat on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate what you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect what you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually got an email from somebody
who is trying to get in touch with the
[SPEAKER_06]: veteran farmers alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do need to put you in touch.
[SPEAKER_06]: With them, Steve, we appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're trying to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're part of the team, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got your back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to support you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move on from the AJ Hashman,
the Bashman session here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to use that as a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashman, Bashman.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's actually, we're 30 minutes into this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a thing on my phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me find.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just took a screenshot of a message
somebody sent me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know everything is in our damn phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy stupid how much these things
are like lifelines.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy says, I'm going to summarize a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says his mother-in-law has Parkinson's
and is really against pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to the point where she's really
getting bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: After listening to countless hours of my
show, this listener figured that I may
[SPEAKER_06]: have an idea as far as strains and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's onto the idea of medical marijuana,
but has it in her mind that the CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: available in Texas will not help.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this person is sure that they won't.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could please lay some knowledge on
this listener about this, there's a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: family that would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I'm going to be a grammar
Nazi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's correct the world here with CBDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just start saying CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBDs is not pluralized.
[SPEAKER_07]: The same way that we don't pluralize
THC's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's just, we don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, waters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't say, I want to get some waters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get all the waters out of this
glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's yeah, it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also since I'm on this, it's not
strands.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strands are hair, strains are cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to get specific, you could say
cultivar or varietal, but let's just not
[SPEAKER_06]: say fucking strands.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard the strands in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard it the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It made the hair on the back of my neck
stand up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, you're so pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just said strands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaving.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this guy, and also since we are,
we're making jokes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mother in law has Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is terrible to hear about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Fox is the guy here that is great at
helping with this type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first he wants to know if we can
recommend a strain that would help with
[SPEAKER_06]: Parkinson's.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a few options.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she's okay with the cannabis and
there's a few one-to-one options that we
[SPEAKER_07]: can go with, that would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Tora Bora being one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tora Sue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Harlequin, which I think comes in at a
three-to-one or two-to-one and certain
[SPEAKER_07]: cases seven-to-one, another great strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she's coming around or slowly coming
around to the idea of medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say start her off with the higher
CBD strains to, you know, higher ratio of
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Auto from Centennial Seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a great example.
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously you're in Texas, so your
options are very limited and unless you
[SPEAKER_07]: can get a specific cut of this,
you know, of what I'm talking about on the
[SPEAKER_07]: ACDC side, at least you're going to have
to go with something like the auto,
[SPEAKER_07]: but from what I understand, it's like 120
to one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and it's, you know- So when he keeps
saying, I'm going to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: He keeps saying 120 to one or two to one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about THC to CBD ratios and
we're trying to find the higher CBD ratio
[SPEAKER_06]: for you is what we need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that she's not going to get the killer
headbutt.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's not going to be high and giggly.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's actually going to get the medicinal
benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from the cannabis because it's higher
in CBD than THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You keep, I don't know how many people
understand the ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for, for, for, I try not to go
past people too.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I forget to elaborate on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I'm not the best at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that being said, and like you
said, Centennial Seeds, auto would be
[SPEAKER_07]: great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think CBD crew is another, you know,
seed company that would be able to help.
[SPEAKER_07]: Booms Farm also has some strains that are,
you know, like I said, you, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can tell them what your situation is,
where you are, and they'll be able to help
[SPEAKER_07]: you with their strain list and give you
something that, you know, will keep you,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in the legal boundaries of what
you need, but to just, let's say with the
[SPEAKER_07]: auto, the autos are great to start off
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's just say why.
[SPEAKER_07]: So CBD is a neuroprotractant.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a few cases done on the
effects of CBD on Parkinson's and it
[SPEAKER_07]: absolutely helps with the confusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps with the tremors.
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps with a lot of the symptoms that
you see usually with that disease or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything, you know, in related to that
condition.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, obviously it's a huge help.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tentures, you know, subliminal dosing,
depending on what the case is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is usually, you know, will be the
quickest.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are CBD ready products that can
also, you know, that you can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry that the company's alluding me
at this point, you know, cause I don't,
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't think of it to mind,
but there are those products available.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you, you know, if you need something
quicker than just growing, what will help
[SPEAKER_07]: her?
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of his question was that he does not
believe that the CBD products available in
[SPEAKER_06]: Texas will be of much use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked him more questions about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a little short conversation on
messenger, on the Instagram messenger
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked him, he said he doesn't feel like
the CBD available there in Texas will
[SPEAKER_06]: help.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's sure that they won't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he asked me how I felt about
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked why he doesn't feel like the
CBD there will help.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the same question.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that he doesn't believe it's going
to be CBD oil, which we've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: People sell CBD oil and it ends up just
being a hundred percent cod oil and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're just messing with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then I'm going to be more specific
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'll start off by giving out my email,
you know, and this can go out and I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: mind, uh, foxtrackcbd at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, even if it's not directly through me,
I will happily direct you through a
[SPEAKER_07]: verified hemp oil sale, uh, you know,
growers, farmers, extractors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I also know a few slew of companies
that already make 50 state ready CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: products that are legitimate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're backed up by testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, you know, we'll have testing for
everything from potency pesticides to
[SPEAKER_07]: mildew and heavy metals and, you know,
an infused product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, yeah, I'm so sorry that it's
living on, on the products, but you can
[SPEAKER_07]: always get at me and I will happily,
you know, I've got them all in my phone,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is right next to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go ahead and take a look in your
phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do my best to get the links.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'll get Fox's email address again
so that you guys don't have to rewind the
[SPEAKER_06]: show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put all this stuff in the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Notes, uh, so that you guys can easily go
and find that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll leave some links there in the show
notes for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that would be probably the most
helpful thing that I can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this CBD legal in Texas, the CBD
product you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, I was working with,
uh, halo labs for a while, which then they
[SPEAKER_07]: were doing an isolate that was,
we were getting back at 99.5 or 57%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I infused a lot of, uh,
50 state legal products with a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: those hard candies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And lollipops that I made were 50 state
legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I, I sent those out for
free to a lot of people because they were
[SPEAKER_07]: skeptical about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, just to get an idea,
some people, I obviously we support whole
[SPEAKER_07]: plant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, both is best.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole plant is best, but if you're in
a situation or have a condition where it's
[SPEAKER_07]: more neurologically tied than higher
concentrations of CBD is where you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: be.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, everything has its
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't knock one thing or another when it
comes to, you know, anything cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: related.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a company called CBD
underscore pure med slab.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are some of the biggest
wholesalers out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, that's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll repeat that at CBD underscore
pure med slab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I said it wrong the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you did it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I wrote it down properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pure med slab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it could be a pure med slab,
whichever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, I interpreted slabs,
but you know, hey, yeah, slabs either way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, they have every, uh,
they're coming out with, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: everything from CBD coffee to thousand
milligram tinctures.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you can get a wide variety
of what you might need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, like I said, dude,
um, I'm not in it to just sit there and
[SPEAKER_07]: tell you that my product is going to be
the best or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't actively put out products like
that, but I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there are slew of companies that are
legitimate, you know, that, that do CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: international is another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally do not, you know,
I have nothing against them or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, you know, um, I know they're
legitimate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're out of California as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, cannabinoids heal is their Instagram
handle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, CBD health solutions is another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are a wholesaler, which also deal in,
uh, cannot drop tinctures and you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like we can go on and on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shop at a health food store in Colorado
Springs and in their window, they have a
[SPEAKER_06]: sign that they sell CBD drops,
of course, from the Stanley brothers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, is that product worth a shit in your
opinion?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, actually I'll tell you what,
I'm going to go and pick some up and then
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have it tested through my
friend, Nate, and then we should do
[SPEAKER_07]: another podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want me to help you, uh,
pay for the cost of that bottle to do it
[SPEAKER_06]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cost of the test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure Nate would love to do it for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll definitely give them a shout out on
the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, I think that they're the biggest
charlatans of all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so you definitely have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, a little bit of research
goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you can also look into halo labs,
um, out of Arizona.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are big wholesalers as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they, you know, work with other
companies to completely rebanned products
[SPEAKER_07]: under what they do at their lab in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, uh, I'm a completely an
open source, you know, Jeff can,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, provide all that information for
this show and all this stuff will be in
[SPEAKER_06]: the show links, show notes, so that you
guys can have links to it on the
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it's good for you to be
cautious, you know, and I'm sorry that you
[SPEAKER_07]: have to feel that way, but I promise you,
there are companies out there that are,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, legitimately, you know,
pursuing the hemp products for what they
[SPEAKER_07]: truly are and not just trying to make a
quick buck on, you know, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the unfortunate situation of our loved
ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also check out King Cola on Instagram and
Sansol CBD in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I definitely support their CBD
project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they may be able to give you
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may be able to acquire a product from
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you what they can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just recommending them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're very knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, something I should mention,
if you're going to consume cannabis for
[SPEAKER_06]: your Parkinson's, uh, don't only focus on
the CBD for the healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend something, a light
sativa, like a jelly bean or a tangy,
[SPEAKER_06]: because you need, I think, uh,
the sativa, the THC and the sativa is good
[SPEAKER_06]: to help treatment, but at the same time,
that's going to put you, the patient in a
[SPEAKER_06]: better mood.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to uplift, uplift your spirits
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to make you a little more
social.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a huge part of healing people
is keeping them happy and keeping a smile
[SPEAKER_06]: on their face.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mood is everything, especially in
recovery.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, strains that have, uh,
you know, known properties of uplifting,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, mood and, you know, um,
anti-anxiety, uh, jelly bean, space queen
[SPEAKER_07]: for me, dairy queen.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the queens kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't, I don't find them as racy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find them smooth, creamy, relaxing.
All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vortex on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a Vortex used to fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, uh, same breeder though.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all TGA subculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have a wide variety of things in
that line of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's awesome that things like
that are available.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're right, you know, not to just
focus on the CBD only side of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Colorado flow is a very other listing
smiley morning bud.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, TGA Shores blueberry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not the most, uh,
knock you down strain, but the smoke is
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very medicinal as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll have, it could have good CBD and a
very good head aroma or a head high too,
[SPEAKER_06]: and a nice blueberry aroma.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been breeding for longer than most of
us have even been thinking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or had any inclination of wanting to work
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: True breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a second ago, you mentioned tincture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we were talking about tincture and
dosage on another episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what do you recommend for dosage on a
tincture?
[SPEAKER_06]: Say somebody, um, has cancer or,
um, maybe I don't even want to diagnose
[SPEAKER_06]: anybody with another condition,
but a sick person, we'll just go with
[SPEAKER_06]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds decent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's go with cancer because,
uh, it would be different, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: if it's more focused on the neurological
condition and it's a higher dose of CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: and if it's THC only, or whether they're
getting Delta nine or all factors and how
[SPEAKER_07]: it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so cancer, we're going to go the other
way around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, obviously treatment, um, that with
guidelines that we followed is through,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, Rick Simpson, though I don't use
his extraction methods of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, gram a day for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, and, and doing that, you know,
when I say that THC high oil, and when I
[SPEAKER_07]: say, um, a gram a day, it's really more
like a thousand milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, you know, a gram isn't a
thousand milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that we, you know,
uh, not enough gets focused on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the short of it, let's not say a
gram a day, let's say a thousand
[SPEAKER_07]: milligrams a day for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that's going to make people feel like
shit also.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there's, you know, um, they usually,
you know, the way you would start,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because people have been
consuming this oil raw for so long,
[SPEAKER_07]: they would start with like little pea
sized bits and that would fuck them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've kind of worked their way up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, trying to work with,
uh, different extraction methods and
[SPEAKER_07]: non-solvent techniques and trying to,
you know, gain the same uptake,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in the amount, but not feeling
so sluggish or more importantly,
[SPEAKER_07]: some of, uh, some of our bodies can't
process that oil the way that we should.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's better left as a topical for a
melanoma.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at that point, if our bodies can't
process it, or if, you know, if we have
[SPEAKER_07]: compromised digestive problems,
you know, whether it be Crohn's,
[SPEAKER_07]: colitis, whatever the case is,
throw that shit out the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need something that isn't going to
harm your gut.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, cause of how, um, uh,
the extraction method leaves it a little,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a little harsh, you know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little sludgy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's sludgy.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little burn to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, regardless of how clean it is,
a lot of people aren't using grape
[SPEAKER_07]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people are using Everclear because
that's what's available to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of those things that come
into account, you know, so we try not to
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with that at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, you've seen me, I'm focusing
more on the non-solvent part of that and
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to focus and, you know,
de-winterize rosin and start doing things
[SPEAKER_07]: of that sort and seeing what we can do
without having to use alcohol or butane or
[SPEAKER_07]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and keep it organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, a friend of ours is, uh, starting a
vineyard, you know, with, uh, some grapes
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're going to be doing a little,
uh, you know, a little project.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be making our own, uh, grape
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we're trying to make this
all in, you know, Pueblo nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's all Colorado organic at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the people that talk crap about Pueblo,
we're doing some things here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're killing it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super happy to come down and be part
of, you know, there's already a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: great people, good caregivers,
uh, good breeders doing their things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so yeah, definitely Pueblo is killing
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for cancer, you'd basically recommend
1000 milligrams of THC per day to try to
[SPEAKER_06]: fight the cancer and you do that for at
least 90 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, I know that sounds
intense and so I'll say this, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, if it's for our loved ones or
whatever the case is taking it via
[SPEAKER_07]: suppository will bypass that feeling of
you eating, you know, a gram plus a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, our bodies will still take it and
absorb it and we'll get all the cancer
[SPEAKER_07]: killing qualities of the THC without that
effect of it going through our digestive
[SPEAKER_07]: system and then into our bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you'll probably get more of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you would get it absorbed quicker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Without it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty amazing how that works,
you know, and we're not talking about just
[SPEAKER_06]: putting some hash or buds in your butt.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be activated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably some hash oil with some
coconut oil inside of a pill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Special pill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have to obviously know where
you're placing it so that it goes into
[SPEAKER_07]: your tract and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to get too specific,
but you know, um, if you guys are curious
[SPEAKER_07]: about that again, you know, uh,
ask me, I'm more than happy to go into
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to do an episode on
gastrointestinal, you know, side effects
[SPEAKER_07]: and things with CBD, we can totally do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, this guy lives like 15 minutes
away from me now, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So who will be on the show a lot?
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me all of your CBD questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more than happy to, you know,
help in any way I can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, at least a thousand
milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, obviously a lot of people don't have
that advantage of knowing someone who can
[SPEAKER_07]: make the suppositories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, maybe that's something I can work on
in the future and try to just,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, uh, create, you know,
put something out there as a little,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, formula for people to follow.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the meanwhile, um, if you can find
on the same level, there are people who
[SPEAKER_07]: make 10,000 milligram tinctures where
every dropper is like 400 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if you happen to be in Colorado or
medical state, it's going to be much
[SPEAKER_07]: easier to find these.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, um, again, you know, trying to
find the material and create that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that medicine is essential.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're going to have to
basically get your math right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just so difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: It breaks my heart just speaking,
you know, about that to other people,
[SPEAKER_07]: knowing that they're in states where they
can't get their oil tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can't get the math right on what
the dosage really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a guessing game of if
they're lucky enough to have the material
[SPEAKER_07]: to make the oil the way that they need to,
how the fuck are they going to dose it or
[SPEAKER_07]: how the fuck are they going to accurately
like, uh, it just upsets me, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: for them as patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but nevertheless, uh, you know,
where there's the will, there's a way,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and lives are more important
than laws in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, hashtag lives over laws.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people, you know, uh, people listening
that are, you know, curious about that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I don't support anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would ever jeopardize your freedom.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're trying to help someone you
love, then I will happily share whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: information I can, you know, Fox is here
to teach.
[SPEAKER_06]: She will sit down with each and every one
of you and teach you what he knows,
[SPEAKER_06]: if that's what's needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, we talked about somebody with
cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what about if you've just got like,
I've got some knee inflammation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work hard, my body, you know,
I'm, I'm a puss.
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of a tall dude, you know,
you put it on your joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get the lower back pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: The knee pain going on at this age.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you recommend, uh, tincture
wise for a guy in my condition?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, honestly, like one to ones are the way
to get like one to ones for when you get
[SPEAKER_07]: off of work and some, uh, high CBD,
low THC, you know, if you need to take it
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout the day, you know, it'll,
uh, it'll prevent any inflammation.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's towards the end of the day,
it'll help bring any down that you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it'll help, um, relax your muscles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're stiff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you, you know, you won't have
that stiffness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I think, uh, CBD is a great way to
start in the morning, especially,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, do you juice or do you, you know,
are you like crap lately?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a vegetarian that eats like crap.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why you're my favorite vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what that means, but okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not vegan dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the vegan guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, shoot, I totally forgot what I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can reroute us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, do you recommend utilizing reclaim in
tincture or edible form?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you, I would suggest if
you're, you know, medicating or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: you drop downs are essential for
collecting reclaim because you don't want
[SPEAKER_07]: to collect some reclaim that's had water
through it and have to, it's just a whole
[SPEAKER_07]: process.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want that humidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's been pretty proven that,
you know, I've seen reclaimed tests high
[SPEAKER_07]: as 63%, you know, THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and that's activated oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it's not fully activated,
but at that point it pretty, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, recollecting it and putting into
a container and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: activating it for a bit longer will
really, I mean, it creates, it's great
[SPEAKER_07]: food grade, you know, um, clean it up
properly, make sure all the moisture is
[SPEAKER_07]: out of it, you know, uh, add your,
uh, oil carrier, you know, your fat
[SPEAKER_07]: carrier, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you're good to go on your
edibles, you know, or your capsules for
[SPEAKER_07]: that matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep talking about activating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you teach us about decarboxylation and
activation?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So decarboxylation, decarbing your oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so depending on what you're killing
for CBD, damn, man is going to be pissed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose that was kind of with her like a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so when you're decarbing for certain
oils, you can decarb for more sedative
[SPEAKER_07]: oil, you know, like, uh, you can convert
CBD or THC oil into CBN and it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: like, it's beyond sedative.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's beyond Indica plus,
you know, so it's like sleepy time for
[SPEAKER_07]: sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sleepy time T times two, you know,
um, which is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, you can do shorter decarb
times at different temperatures to stay
[SPEAKER_07]: within that, uh, not break that acid
barrier.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you decarboxylate something,
uh, there's an oil decarboxylic acid,
[SPEAKER_07]: which accounts for a certain percentage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you do that, you're going to
obtain a loss.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like minuscule.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to notice it,
but you need to know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: when you see the bubbles coming up out of
your oil and stuff, that's decarboxylic
[SPEAKER_07]: acid, you know, coming up and,
you know, leaving, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_07]: the oil so that you, you know,
a lot of people assume that, that it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, solvent or something, you know,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're starting with clean oil,
that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've already dabbed it, there's no
solvent left.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, if, you know, depending on
the situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then I'm actually going to start,
uh, decarboxylating all the solventless
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've never really done a lot of that
because I've, you know, focused on butane
[SPEAKER_07]: extractions mostly or isolate
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so it'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it should be too different
with the rosin, but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So wouldn't you think the rosin has kind
of already activated a little since it's
[SPEAKER_07]: been through so much heat?
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking, uh, you know, half grams from
all these different presses and I want to
[SPEAKER_07]: get them tested for that reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: But from what I've seen, even from like
soil grown stuff and other people,
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen, uh, it's not fully
activated.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the chips come in at like,
like that raw, uh, the reclaim,
[SPEAKER_07]: the rosin chips are coming in at like 30
to 50%.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can do an ISO soak or even
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, what I would do personally,
if you guys do the rosin and you guys are
[SPEAKER_07]: big collectors is do can of butter with
your rosin chips, you know, because
[SPEAKER_07]: that's, you're gonna, you can break it all
down almost like a mulch and just,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, uh, double up on your cheese
cloth when you're filtering, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're OCD like me and, uh,
it'll make some great butter for edibles,
[SPEAKER_07]: like hands down, you know, some real good
body high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, I'm a total fan of, uh, and advocate
of using the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that's why we're actually growing some
of them with just water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Straight water, no needs, uh, so that we
can juice those, uh, those couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: sweets, you know, and then we can say like
no animal byproduct, nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just nothing, just straight our
over.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, we're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm going to pull something up so that
we can get a little specific with the
[SPEAKER_07]: decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to learn a whole bunch of
stuff here, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be patient while he searches.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a little bit of information to
pull up for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys can use your reclaim and he
mentioned using a dropdown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we often forget that some of our
friends are not dabbers and they don't dab
[SPEAKER_06]: daily and they might be in other States
where the toilets flush the wrong way and
[SPEAKER_06]: the weed grows upside down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, our Australian friends,
I might've said States too, and he's in
[SPEAKER_06]: another country.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a state.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I find out Australia had States.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I stupidly thought it was just
Australia and all of Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's like no parts of Sydney and
other places.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, a dropdown, you guys, a dropdown
will go on your normally where the nail
[SPEAKER_06]: would go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put a dropdown in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a piece of glass that, uh,
comes out where the nail would go and it
[SPEAKER_06]: angles down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it angles back up to where your
nail or your email could go on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just puts the nail a couple of
inches away from your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also makes a nice place to catch
the reclaim oil so that it doesn't end up
[SPEAKER_06]: in your rig water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what a dropdown is.
[SPEAKER_06]: When he was talking about a dropdown
earlier, um, shout out to my friend,
[SPEAKER_06]: Rasta said in Australia, uh, thanks for
the support.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good seeing you on Facebook live.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox is diligently searching for this
information here.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to talk THC first.
[SPEAKER_07]: So boiling point for THC would be 315
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what that, that would start to
boil off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's when it starts to convert.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will convert it to, if there's
any CBD to convert to, that's what it
[SPEAKER_07]: would convert.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's go back to the THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you would want to be between 290 and
310 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_07]: 290 and 310.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's between the CBCA and THC
barrier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, CBCA is another, uh, compound we can,
that's a whole nother three hour
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation, but we can get into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's, let's just dork talk for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, getting back to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that will activate your Delta 9,
which is obviously your, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_07]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also an anti-inflammatory,
appetite stimulant, anti-emetic,
[SPEAKER_07]: anti-prophylic and antioxidant on top of,
you know, all the wonderful things that it
[SPEAKER_07]: does with, uh, cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that being said, um, depending on how
long you go on the decarb, you can over,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you can burn your oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to be careful of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, going for the longer
decarbs, but, um, I've decarbed oil for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, three hours, six hours,
uh, eight hours, just to see, just to get
[SPEAKER_07]: to see where the set of, set of effect
comes out, where the burnout, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where, where am I burning things out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I, you know, you can decarb the
oil for, let's say 90 minutes,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but honestly, I would say 180 minutes
is, you know, a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like to look at it every,
every, uh, shit, every 45 to 60 minutes to
[SPEAKER_07]: see how it's doing, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause every oil that you start with is
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be my oil you're using.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to be using your oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll tell you these, you know,
times and mindsets, but just keep in mind
[SPEAKER_07]: and keep an eye on everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once all the decarbolic acid,
I hope I'm saying that right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry from that little medicated,
um, you know, uh, comes out of the oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you're left with, uh,
is, you know, this decarbed goodness that
[SPEAKER_07]: is fully activated, you know, and
depending on what temperature points that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're hitting, you're either activating
for CBD, you're activating for terpene
[SPEAKER_07]: rich activated oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it all depends, you know, it's like,
you can just play around with your
[SPEAKER_07]: temperatures and have a completely
different product depending on what you
[SPEAKER_07]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is one, so if I had some reclaim,
if I had my dropdown, I had some reclaim
[SPEAKER_06]: and I collected a substantial amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I want to activate it to decarb it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and I want to get it to this
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I just put it in a Pyrex dish and maybe
throw it in the oven?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a tech to this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it something you want to share?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: To make it really easy, uh, and just like,
you can call it low tech or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So get yourself to Target or Walmart or
whatever you're, I don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care who you go to, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any place that sells Pyrex and try to find
a small like, shit, I don't even know what
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of little bowl it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a little Pyrex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, like a little salsa bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, like a little pampered chef.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and they'll, they'll sell them
in a few different sizes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to get a small one if you can,
cause you know, it's just make it easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can take your dropdown when
it's full or gunked up and take a torch to
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I mean that very, you know,
gently just torch it a little bit until
[SPEAKER_07]: you can see the oil moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, uh, you, you can pour all the
oil into the little ramekin cup or
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The, the Pyrex ramekin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, yeah, after that, you know,
after you've got that all poured in,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, be very careful not to,
you know, crack your dropdown,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, um, there's easier ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put the dropdown in the oven and,
uh, let it get, you know, warm and pour it
[SPEAKER_07]: out or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids don't try this at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This way just kind of works a little bit
easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just taking a light little flame
to it, watching the oil move, it'll all
[SPEAKER_07]: dump out and then you can start getting to
work on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, after you decarb it,
you can, you know, add your carrot oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always like to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once we've got it into the Petri or
the, uh, the ramekin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what do we do with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you've got it in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You set your temperature depending on what
you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually, if you guys want to
learn something, you can Google a cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: activation chart and, uh, you'll see a
bunch of different, uh, pictures and
[SPEAKER_07]: graphs, and it'll kind of give you an idea
of, you know, where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people, like I said, are just
activating, you know, for the THC and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, you know, like I said,
so let's say an even 300, 180 minutes,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, just pop it in the oven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pop it in the oven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, let's do its thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, some people like to add the carrier
oil before they decarb it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I like to decarb the oil completely
and then add my carrier oil to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, whether it's going to be
avocado, coconut, grapeseed, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: Lynch, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grape seed oil sun, sunflowers,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a bunch like each depending on the
patient, whatever the hell they're
[SPEAKER_07]: allergic to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be like, all right, there's,
there's something, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guaranteed a fat that your body can take.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So needless to say, you know, there's ways
around whatever, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so you put it in the oven,
you know, you set your time, you check on
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, once it's ready, you know,
you, uh, add, oh, and let's back up a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit before you put it in the oven,
weigh it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know how much that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes it super easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're working with seven grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are three grams or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how much coconut oil you're going
to put in.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to weigh that out too.
[SPEAKER_07]: That will make it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a weight specific ratio that you can
work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, sometimes I go really low,
you know, like one gram to seven grams,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and, or less, you know,
just to kind of get it to this wonderful,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, all for consistency,
depending on what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, um, that being said,
uh, once that's added, once, once you have
[SPEAKER_07]: your numbers and everything's weighed,
do everything we talked about,
[SPEAKER_07]: set it, set it in your Petri dish or your
ramekin cup, put it in the oven,
[SPEAKER_07]: do carbon for X amount of time,
add your oil, make sure that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's, it's bonded that the side separated.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put it back in the oven for just a
little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, you know, follow the recipe
of what to, whatever you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_07]: capsules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if you're trying to, you know,
keep the oil, you can pull it to syringe,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and, and keep it, you know,
keep it ready for until you need it or,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, whatever you're trying to do.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those syringes are sketchy looking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, I'm not a fan of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes that's the best way that you
can apply it to whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or something, you know, the best way to
collect it in, excuse me, in large
[SPEAKER_07]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are a wealth of CBD knowledge,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't, I guess, uh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that somebody, I'm a weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love knowing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love knowing about breeding and strains
and strain selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that somebody has focused in on the
cannabinoids in the making specific
[SPEAKER_06]: products for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that's a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of jealous right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been going for just about an
hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask you one more question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and then we're going to have to wrap
up this show for the night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost midnight here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Fox will be back.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, he lives close, like I said,
and, uh, we get along real well and he
[SPEAKER_06]: shows up with Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, he'll be back and he brings this
really cool rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so somebody sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, uh, they're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have a baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wanted to know how I feel and
what information I had on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, uh, as a stoner dude,
I really haven't thought too much about
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel that, uh, that's a lot of my
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't be preaching anything about
that, but do you have an opinion on it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, um, I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, first of all, let me start by
saying, uh, you know, a woman's body is
[SPEAKER_07]: her own fucking business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not one to say shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I'll tell you my experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my ex-wife, uh, the mother,
my child, um, had a horrible morning
[SPEAKER_07]: sickness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, holy shit, dude, just as she wasn't
able to work, she wasn't able to work at
[SPEAKER_07]: her job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, she was a banker at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it was, it was really affecting her.
[SPEAKER_07]: What helped, you know, was some cannabis
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is, we weren't,
this is, this is back way back,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, eight, nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, almost 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it, people weren't up on the clean oil
game the way that we are for the most
[SPEAKER_07]: part, you know, Miami, whatever the case
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're lucky to get good flour,
whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at first it kind of made me interesting
to think, you know, how it would affect
[SPEAKER_07]: our child, but seeing, you know,
my partner in pain and not being able to
[SPEAKER_07]: work or literally not being able to stand
up straight because she would have to run
[SPEAKER_07]: to the bathroom and throw up cannabis is
what happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would help, you know, like literally
just a single puff or two would hold her
[SPEAKER_07]: over for six to eight hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not like a heavy, you know,
doses knee.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really, even back then it helped me
see the medical attributes that we weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: seeing, you know, beyond getting high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so my opinion on it is ladies,
uh, I, when it comes to the dabbing,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, um, I can't say that I approve
of anything made with solvents because
[SPEAKER_07]: we've yet to see these effects on infants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, as adults, you know,
we, we, we do them and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: regardless of whether it's clean to the
state standards.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, you know, you've seen the live
resident, I mean, we'd love, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I love live resident and, you know,
body versus that few ounce fetus affected
[SPEAKER_07]: completely different residual solvent.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when it comes to that, we can talk dry
sift bubble, and at the same time,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, unless that bubble hash or the
full melts has been microbially tested or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything like, you know, you have to be
beyond anal about your meds, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I can't stress that enough,
you know, so if, if we had some clean
[SPEAKER_06]: Rasta Jeff grown medicine that,
you know, it was clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't sprayed with anything funky.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was grown with love with organic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I harvested it and I passed it
off to Fox and Fox made, uh, some clean,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we'll just stick with the flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, would then at that point, would you
approve of pregnant mom smoking a little
[SPEAKER_06]: flower?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, my ex-girlfriend,
uh, got pregnant and this is after we got
[SPEAKER_07]: separated and it would tear me up because
she was a hardcore dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, but at the same time,
she's a medical patient in her own regard
[SPEAKER_07]: to cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's here again, having her second
child.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who am I to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm not sure, you know,
then that that's the other thing to that
[SPEAKER_07]: with my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, and she ended up having a beautiful
little girl, like just the picture
[SPEAKER_07]: perfect, you know, picture of it,
of a little beautiful child.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't say shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with my daughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up with a gorgeous little girl and
I'm super grateful and like nothing in my
[SPEAKER_07]: little kid's brightest shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm, I'm, I'm super blessed to
have a little smart ass knucklehead on my
[SPEAKER_07]: hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a smart ass 12 year old daughter
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her mom didn't consume much cannabis
during pregnancy because her claim was
[SPEAKER_06]: that when she inhaled smoke, she's
depriving the fetus of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was why she didn't want to smoke,
but she did have a little bit of a edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, there's been like posts
and stuff I've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I follow some of these mom groups and
stuff because of the CBD stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's obviously a lot of posts about
the pregnancy and smoking and fetuses
[SPEAKER_07]: don't, they're in the womb.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they, they're lungs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are developing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not taking in oxygen from the,
from the air outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're taking in what mom because they
would drown in amniotic fluid,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a doctor, but yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's been proven.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there goes that to the debate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think with everything that
we've been lied to about cannabis as well,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like, you know, once upon a
time, Philip Morris said it was okay for
[SPEAKER_07]: you to have a smoke, you know,
if you're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so to that regard, I'd love for there
to be some research done on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I would never, in my opinion,
would I ever turn away a patient that was
[SPEAKER_07]: pregnant because you're from me because of
my opinion?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would totally do everything I can to
offer them the cleanest meds to dab or
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke or, you know, preferably vaporize.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just me personally, I would just
go out of the way to suggest the cleanest
[SPEAKER_07]: forms of medication, edibles, tinctures,
vaporization, you know, that you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like your approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let the women do what women feel like they
should do because we are not women nor
[SPEAKER_06]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to my listener who asked what we feel
about it, I'm trying to find some
[SPEAKER_06]: information on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not, all the information is
conflicting.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no real studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are hearsay studies, I think,
but I don't think there's any like actual,
[SPEAKER_06]: this lady smoked all nine months of her
pregnancy and this lady didn't,
[SPEAKER_06]: here's baby A and baby B.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's been a study done about
testing breast milk and they took the
[SPEAKER_07]: breast milk of women who never fucking
smoke cannabis in their damn lives,
[SPEAKER_07]: let alone in their generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like where you're headed with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they found natural cannabinoids in
breast milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's my theory, you know,
there's people that don't need to smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis or don't have a big involvement
with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I look at them like health-wise
and they seem to have a healthy
[SPEAKER_07]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's self-regulating, there's no
problem, you know, whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's obviously not the case with some of
us, you know, as we need to regulate
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever, whether we need to work,
whether we need to relax, whether we need
[SPEAKER_07]: to calm down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do it with this beautiful plant
because our body's inability and
[SPEAKER_07]: deficiency of natural reoccurring
cannabinoids, that can evolve all under
[SPEAKER_07]: whether we're breast milk, that's a whole
other fucking conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But back to my point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's natural cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's cannabinoids in breast milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can hurt when you're having clean
medicine to enrich and nourish your
[SPEAKER_07]: natural milk to give your offspring if
it's only building and helping them have
[SPEAKER_07]: better antibodies and helping them build
better immune systems and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also giving them a better chance of
not having deficiencies in those senses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, again, I'm all for more study of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the main point of life is to
survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think once that child's born,
it will consume that breast milk.
[SPEAKER_06]: That breast milk has cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens when you consume a lot of
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: You get hungrier, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are you going to want to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to want to consume more
breast milk.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that baby going to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow stronger, get stronger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what's it going to want?
[SPEAKER_06]: More breast milk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully- It's shitty on titty,
but hey, great for the baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so there's my two cents on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if it's like a little awkward
about it, but you know- I like your
[SPEAKER_07]: approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I, you know, I'd love to see
more research done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to see- here's what I'd love to
see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to see more moms justifying the
science of it and being more explaining
[SPEAKER_07]: the situation better as opposed to just
like taking a picture of their tit out in
[SPEAKER_07]: their kid's mouth and like saying that
they're, you know, opposing something
[SPEAKER_07]: like, dude, no one cares.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're beyond that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to, you know, and I'm talking
about cannabis mops, not just mops in
[SPEAKER_07]: general, you know, like I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like free the titty, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like anyways- Who's afraid of titties?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, obviously a lot of people are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Horrible people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Horrible people.
[SPEAKER_06]: To say people that are afraid of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, dude, you know, all for women
doing that with cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and like I said, there's still up to
tinctures, fucking transdermals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know of a mom that used like natural
hemp products to not get any fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: stretch marks and she blew up like a damn
whale and didn't stretch her fucking skin
[SPEAKER_07]: out once.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to be blunt about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not use her name, but shout out to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: She knows who she is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but just saying, you know,
like even on a hemp CBD scale,
[SPEAKER_07]: it can just help your skin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can, it can help you have more
comfortable pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you want, you don't want to be
stressed at all at that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if cannabis, CBD products, you know,
can help you do that and they can,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I think that's a lot better
than, I don't really know the science of
[SPEAKER_07]: prenatal drugs, but they may make me a
little curious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, with all the vaccinations and
all the crazy shit that we have going on
[SPEAKER_07]: with autism and other things like that,
it just makes me curious and nervous.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, go cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a great way to end this podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, I want to thank you for coming in and
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been here for like three hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've probably smoked like a quarter ounce
of hash over the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I had to leave early.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys follow white Mike on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you support his Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should really be white Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't write that down or anything
and I remembered it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming on the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not mad that you had to leave early.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took plenty of dabs for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: How can my listeners follow you on social
media, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so I am FoxtrackCBD on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's F-O-X-T-R-A-C-T-S, you guys,
just to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Foxtrack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope my listeners out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: FoxtrackCBD spelled the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, just Foxtrack on Instagram and
run CBD genetics on Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, I'm going to, just on a
really quick note, I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: in-house working with a new company called
Athena Green.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's another breeder that's focused on
medical strains, focusing on clusters and
[SPEAKER_07]: migraine headaches, Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm working together with the
stuff I'm doing with my CBD in similar
[SPEAKER_07]: regards.
[SPEAKER_07]: To help create better medicinal attributed
strains with good turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just very, very simple goal,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's hard to get that good medicine and
good tasting medicine in the same regard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's our goal for the years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll obviously be talking with you
about that sooner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will, we will collab on some of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, you'll see everything posted on
my Instagram, Foxtracks, or on the Run CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: page.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or on Twitter when I'm bored, cause I'm
dumb and I forget how to use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people forget about the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all over Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's slowed down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys want to thank you guys for
listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox, thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be back in just a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will wrap up the show you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys enjoyed that talk about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to send a huge thank you to Mike
and also a big huge thank you to Kabuki
[SPEAKER_06]: for joining me on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again for listening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be back in seven days with another
episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be back with episode number 131.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'd like to sponsor the podcast or if
you've got a product you'd like me to
[SPEAKER_06]: review, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's growfromyourheart.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get you all the information that you
do need.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I would appreciate if you go
to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_06]: search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, find the review section.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'd be really cool if you give me
a star rating of whatever you feel is
[SPEAKER_06]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to beg you for five stars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me what you feel is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Type in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know what you think about the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's all I've got for you this
week, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: you next
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll quit talking about a traffic stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since we're talking about the police,
here's one more thing I do need to
[SPEAKER_06]: mention.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if everybody that listens
realizes that I am the owner, founder,
[SPEAKER_06]: proprietor, head breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am iRegenetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the seed company that makes feminized
and regular cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I receive a lot of messages on Instagram,
Facebook, emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any forum you could think of, I get an
email or a message via that service asking
[SPEAKER_06]: me to ship seeds to people in various
locations.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I might've said this on another
episode, but I have to remind you,
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot ship seeds to anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am trying to be fully legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to be fully legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying not to break any rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in Colorado, they're letting us grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a wonderful job at Green and
Healthy Wellness as the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no need for me to screw that up in
my life by sending people seeds to make a
[SPEAKER_06]: few extra bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing just fine financially.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fucking great financially,
not to brag, but I don't even need to send
[SPEAKER_06]: you seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a website, however.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are called thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they have my seeds available.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are currently sold out, is what I'm
told.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will get a package in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't promise you when.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know when they'll put them on
sale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they'll even make it to
the website.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may have people lined up on a waiting
list already.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I do know is as soon as they get
those seeds, they sell out quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll have to pay attention to
thedankteam.com if you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't have iRegenetics seeds,
check out Sin City, check out Mile High,
[SPEAKER_06]: check out Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rare Dankness is always good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if the Sour Seed Company is
on there, but I highly recommend the Sour
[SPEAKER_06]: Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can never go wrong with the Cali
Connection and you can never go wrong with
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Short Seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So find yourself some good seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if they aren't iRe seeds,
you can get them at thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize that I can't ship you seeds,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to be safe, trying to be careful,
trying not to break any rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're here in Colorado and you're 21
and over, find me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can put some seeds in your garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to be fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to be polite about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't ship you anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, this was a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go ahead and open up the
Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's taking my phone a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might edit part of this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the damn message?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this message comes from a friend on the
Grow From Your Heart podcast Facebook
[SPEAKER_06]: page.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from our friend Elizabeth and she
says, quick question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm growing a few plants from seed and I
was wondering if when I take a cutting to
[SPEAKER_06]: flower for determining sex, if I should
flower the clone or the rooted seedling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could swear that I heard you say it was
better to flower the rooted seedling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I remember that correctly?
[SPEAKER_06]: There is not a rule to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of personal preference.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me back up and tell you basically
what this person's asking just to be more
[SPEAKER_06]: clear in case you guys aren't caught up to
what the question here is.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you grow a plant from seed,
you don't know if that plant is a male or
[SPEAKER_06]: a female unless of course it came from
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you grow a regular seed,
it's got a 50-50 chance of being a male or
[SPEAKER_06]: a female.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to waste a lot of time,
space, energy, nutrients, and water on a
[SPEAKER_06]: plant that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_06]: So unless you're breeding, you need to
eliminate your male plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once your seed plant gets large enough,
I recommend taking a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let that clone establish healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you need to flower either the original
plant from seed or that clone to determine
[SPEAKER_06]: if that plant is a male or a female.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really up to you if you want to
flower out the plant that came from seed
[SPEAKER_06]: or if you want to flower the clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are advantages and disadvantages to
both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got that plant that came from
seed and it's big enough to take a clone,
[SPEAKER_06]: once that clone is rooted and you know
you've got a copy of it, you're safe to
[SPEAKER_06]: flower out that seed plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: The original plant from seed, because now
you've got a backup in the clone room,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the mom room, whatever, in the veg
room, you've got a backup of that plant
[SPEAKER_06]: over there and you've already got a plant
that's established and that's large and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's healthy and is ready to flower and
ready to throw out some buds for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can always flower out that seed
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: The advantage to that is it's already
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got it, a big healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people really like to keep that
original seeded plant from seed around as
[SPEAKER_06]: their mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like to keep that one because it was
the original and they feel like it's got
[SPEAKER_06]: more vigor and it's got more strength to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like if you take a clone and
you do it properly and that clone is cared
[SPEAKER_06]: for and the mother plant, the donor plant
was healthy when the clone was taken,
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like the clone and that seed plant
are going to be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can take your clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can let your clone root.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get your clone into soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it into a good pot,
get some roots established.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do it in a cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done this in cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've ran phenohunts from cups before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done plenty of plant sexting while
plants while clones were just in little
[SPEAKER_06]: tiny cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can take your clone and you can
either pot it into a larger pot if you
[SPEAKER_06]: want, or you can leave it in the cup and
put it in the flower room and put it into
[SPEAKER_06]: flower, change the lights to 1212.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, within seven to 10 days,
you're going to see if that plant is a
[SPEAKER_06]: male or a female.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, one of the main advantages to keeping
your clones in cups and using the cup
[SPEAKER_06]: method to do a sexting round is that it
takes way less space to run a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_06]: of cups than it would run a bunch of
potted plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're doing a large phenohunt of
like maybe 25 to 50 plants, it's much
[SPEAKER_06]: easier to have 25 to 50 cups underneath
the light with little tiny clones in there
[SPEAKER_06]: just waiting to show you sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way you didn't waste time growing
large plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you grew out a male that was a
waste of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the advantage to do in the cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the advantages.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to you, whichever you want to do
really.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to take it, always take a
clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So grow that plant from seed, take a
clone, get the clone rooted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to run that clone as your
flowering plant to determine sex,
[SPEAKER_06]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to run that seed as your
flowering plant to determine sex,
[SPEAKER_06]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you keep one of them back to
have in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you run that clone, you've already got
a big mother plant waiting to give you
[SPEAKER_06]: more clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you run the mother plant that came from
seed, you've already got a big bushy
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are advantages.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a production facility, what I do is I
plant the seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I let the seed grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take the clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as that clone shows me roots,
I throw that clone into a pot and then I
[SPEAKER_06]: actually flower out the original plant
from seed because it's already big enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, in a commercial production
facility, I don't have a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_06]: space for extra plants sitting around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to waste my plant count
because we are based on a plant count
[SPEAKER_06]: because we are a medical facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're allowed to have so many plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So since I've already got a plant that's
large enough to flower, I go ahead and
[SPEAKER_06]: flower that plant out to find out what
I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I find out that I've got a male,
usually I go throw that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cut that male down, take it out of the
computer system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I go and take down every clone
also that I have made of that male plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we eliminate those as well so that we
don't have any males sitting around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is how, mainly how we work on
sexing our plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is another method.
[SPEAKER_06]: This kind of helps me segue into something
else I wanted to talk about, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing that you can do,
I do not use this method.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know plenty of people that do.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, this seems a little bit harsh to
my plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: What some people do, you can take a plant
and put it into your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_06]: For seven to 10 days, just long enough to
show you sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually I think I can spot a male more
early than I can a female because I've
[SPEAKER_06]: been doing it for so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the males try to show you sex a
little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So take your plants, put them in the
flowering room, let them start showing you
[SPEAKER_06]: sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as you are sure of the sex,
take them out of the flowering room,
[SPEAKER_06]: put them back in the veg room under 24
hours of light, and they will go back into
[SPEAKER_06]: veg for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may take them a couple of weeks,
but they will go back into veg.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what some people do, they plant a seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: They let the seed grow until it's decent
size.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right when you put that seed into your
three gallon pot, let it get rooted and
[SPEAKER_06]: then move it to the flower room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they just leave it there for a
few days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they've got a little plant that's
starting to show sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as soon as it shows sex,
they put it back in the veg room.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a female, they put it back into
the veg room and grow it up to the bigger
[SPEAKER_06]: size that they want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then take a clone from it and then flower
that plant out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this sounds harsh, but it does have
its advantages.
[SPEAKER_06]: The main advantage here is that you don't
need to take any clones and you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: waste a lot of time and space growing
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you take your plants and you put them
into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as soon as you see boys, you throw
them away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now you can just move your plants
right back into the veg room and just grow
[SPEAKER_06]: those females up to their full size.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you establish sex without taking any
clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you know what you've got and
you've eliminated your boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it comes flower time, you know
you're working with all girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly recommend taking a clone from
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before you flower those plants,
please take a clone because you might grow
[SPEAKER_06]: the most amazing cannabis you've ever had.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't have a clone from it,
you're going to kick yourself in the ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reveging is also used after harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen people finish a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take a plant that takes nine weeks to
flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You flower it out for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You harvest most of it, but you just leave
one or two branches on that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then put that plant with one or two
harvested plant with one or two branches
[SPEAKER_06]: on it under 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to take probably two
months, honestly, before that plant starts
[SPEAKER_06]: to grow back as a normal vegging plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you didn't take a clone,
this is your only way to rescue your
[SPEAKER_06]: strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take this sad looking mostly harvested
plant and you torture it by putting it
[SPEAKER_06]: under a light for about two months.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want it under 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to feed it kind of a heavy
nitrogen diet.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll bring it back around to the veg
stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: The leaves are going to start curling and
looking like arthritis hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be spirally.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant is going to be pissed off for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as soon as you see those normal leaves
start coming out, your plant is going back
[SPEAKER_06]: into its normal stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: The hormones have started reconverting
back into the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's starting to know what's going on with
life again.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would recommend at that point,
as soon as you have a couple of healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: shoots that look normal, clone those and
take those clones and use those clones as
[SPEAKER_06]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you've got that strain around
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep one clone and flower out the other
clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you've got that strain forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recommend that, but if you do make
the mistake of not taking a clone and you
[SPEAKER_06]: realize that this plant that you're
growing is going to be one of the most
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing things you've ever seen,
revegging is probably the only way to
[SPEAKER_06]: rescue this strain other than a tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am not prepared to teach you how to
do a tissue culture through a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Elizabeth, I hope I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I did not give a definitive answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I said that it's kind of up to you
and your environment and the way that you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to do things, but I hope I helped you
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for giving me the opportunity
to talk about how to sex your plants and
[SPEAKER_06]: revegging.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, my next topic comes from at the
Barefoot Grower on Instagram, also known
[SPEAKER_06]: as Will on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will had no idea I was going to talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will posted a Facebook post today that
simply said, stop smoking blunts in your
[SPEAKER_06]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is such a good post.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had no idea I was going to talk about
this on the podcast today, but I see
[SPEAKER_06]: people posting pictures of themselves on
Facebook, on Instagram and on Snapchat,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're smoking blunts, smoking bulls
and smoking dabs in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a really bad idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think smoking a blunt in a grow room is
going to impart that blunt taste on your
[SPEAKER_06]: growing buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before those buds are even done,
they're already going to taste like a
[SPEAKER_06]: dirty blunt wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, you guys, I don't prefer the
flavor of a blunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grow some of the best cannabis we can
possibly grow on this planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you wrap it up in a shitty ass
tobacco leaf with some fake flavoring in
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't dig it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked tobacco wood with my buddy the
other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not into the blunts, but I feel that
blowing this blunt smoke on your plants
[SPEAKER_06]: around your plants is going to make your
plants taste like a dirty ass blunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also here's what Will had to say about
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will said tobacco smoke is very thick and
actually can suffocate your plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: stopping the photosynthesis process
because the plant will be too busy
[SPEAKER_06]: breathing and filtering the smoke to take
in CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he also goes on to say also
blunts and most over-the-counter tobacco
[SPEAKER_06]: products have a ton of chemicals in them
that are bad for your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cigarettes are the main concern,
but blunts will begin to show harmful
[SPEAKER_06]: results if done regularly and frequently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, you shouldn't smoke anything in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he says, but if you're going to,
it should be a bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: The less carcinogens in the air,
the healthier your plants will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I agree with that, Will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good post, great post.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, quit smoking in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to be in the grow room
giving your plants smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be in the grow room giving
your plants love and CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't blow smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep the plants clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to ruin the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the terps nowadays and
nobody wants tobacco turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody wants tobacco turps in
their cannabis, but 99% of the world
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't want tobacco turps in their
cannabis and nobody wants tobacco turps in
[SPEAKER_06]: their concentrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: So stop smoking blunts in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop smoking anything in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go smoke outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the canny canyon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go smoke at the canny canyon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go smoke at the dab table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't smoke in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not good for your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco
anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just get down on cannabis,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been talking for nearly 19 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's time for me to press
pause, take a drink, take a fat dab,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a couple of fat dabs and I got a
nice drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: While I was taking a drink, I was drinking
some kombucha, some GTs, kombucha organic
[SPEAKER_06]: and raw original with enzymes and
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it reminded me that a listener
recently asked me a question about
[SPEAKER_06]: probiotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: He asked me if I could recommend a brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: He asked about a specific brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, what I like is the brand Raw
Probiotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy specific blends for men or
women or for older folks or for children.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pretty sure that the person that
emailed me was a dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would recommend the Raw Probiotics
for men.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're available at most health food
stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the probiotics I would support.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's talk more about cannabis related
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody recently sent me a message asking
me if I think holding in your smoke gets
[SPEAKER_06]: you higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take a dab, if you take a bong rip,
if you smoke a joint, do you feel like
[SPEAKER_06]: holding your hit, holding your smoke in
your lungs gives you a better buzz?
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, I'm going to say I'm not a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put that out there straight up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my stoner opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like when I take a dab,
I feel like most of what I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_06]: goes into my lungs pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Within probably three seconds at the most,
maybe five seconds, I have absorbed
[SPEAKER_06]: everything that that dab is going to give
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get it in, I let it sit for about a
half a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a second, I pull in the dab and then
I blow it back out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only in me for just a brief second,
just so that I could feel it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I push it back out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like when you keep the smoke in
your lungs is when it's going to cause
[SPEAKER_06]: problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like my lungs absorb everything
they're going to get really quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I keep that smoke in there,
I'm going to start absorbing the tars and
[SPEAKER_06]: the soot and the extra crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: The smoke is going to stick to my lungs
and I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the CBD, the CBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the good medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the bad part of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think taking a big fat dab and
holding it in, you might not get higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're just getting a head rush
from lack of oxygen and you're just
[SPEAKER_06]: feeling a rush because you're not giving
yourself any air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I feel like that pressure,
having your lungs inflated like that is
[SPEAKER_06]: probably very strenuous on your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could probably hurt yourself by doing
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then those people that take in a big hit
and they cough and they try not to cough
[SPEAKER_06]: and hold in the big hit, you make this
noise, you start doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel like that's going to blow
something up in your body.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to rupture the lung.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to blow a blood vessel in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you need to get the smoke in and
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think smoke needs to sit around in
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you get higher from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you're going to absorb more
from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's going to happen almost
instantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're just putting yourself at
risk for COPD or other lung problems in
[SPEAKER_06]: the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to elaborate on this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that I think happens,
I take ginormous dabs sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day I took a two gram dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me be clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not able to put two grams on the nail
and pull it all into my lungs in one draw
[SPEAKER_06]: because I would have to put the nail
really hot to get it to burn or vaporize
[SPEAKER_06]: that quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am taking multiple inhalations,
but I'm not taking a break.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dropping one and a half to two grams
of dabs on the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just drop it right on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to kind of slowly stir it into the
nail and let it melt into there and then
[SPEAKER_06]: carb cap it and just start sucking on that
rig, pulling a big fat hit, blow it out,
[SPEAKER_06]: pulling another rip, blow it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it'll take me three or four full
inhalations, a full lung expand in and out
[SPEAKER_06]: of my lungs, but I'll smoke two grams in
one dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call that one dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is one dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't take a break or anything,
but it wasn't all one rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I can feel the hash coat my
lungs and I feel like I'm kind of giving
[SPEAKER_06]: myself a time release medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm smoking so much hash in one quick time
period that I'm coating my lungs with
[SPEAKER_06]: enough oil to where my body can absorb it
all at once, but there's nowhere for it to
[SPEAKER_06]: go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this oil kind of hangs out.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this hash is just hanging out stuck to
my lung.
[SPEAKER_06]: As my body can absorb it, that hash is
right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: My lungs are just sucking up that hash oil
the whole time and I'm just absorbing
[SPEAKER_06]: those cannabinoids and absorbing those
medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm giving myself a time release
medication by taking these ginormous dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no science to that, but I feel like
I stay high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I stay getting high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just keep getting higher and higher and
higher as it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I won't have smoked for a full
hour and I'll still be fully medicated
[SPEAKER_06]: because I think that a layer of dab that
is coated in my lungs is just being
[SPEAKER_06]: absorbed by my body slowly and getting
into my bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my elaboration.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_06]: My opinion, holding smoke is a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to hold it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take another dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Breathe it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blow it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take another damn dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got another dab for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think your lungs only get so much use
before they wear out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you get so many inhales and
exhales of your lungs before they're just
[SPEAKER_06]: going to tire out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't wear your lungs out by holding in
smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just blow it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a couple of more things I want to
talk about and then we're going to wrap up
[SPEAKER_06]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's something random.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, wear some protective eyewear in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lights are bright.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're running more than four,
maybe five or six lights in there,
[SPEAKER_06]: you need to get yourself some Method 7
glasses and protect your eyes from the
[SPEAKER_06]: lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, protect your skin.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in a room with 10 or more lights
and you're in there for more than a few
[SPEAKER_06]: hours a day, it's a good idea to wear some
sort of long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep your head covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep your eyes covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that those lights are not good
for your skin.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sun gives us cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why won't these artificial lights give us
some sort of skin problems?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I highly recommend covering up
your skin and your eyes if you're in a
[SPEAKER_06]: grow room all day long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wear my Method 7 glasses from the minute
I walk into the grow room to the minute I
[SPEAKER_06]: walk out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the Method 7s on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to wear a long sleeve shirt in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets kind of hot, but it's still worth
wearing a long sleeve shirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, here's something really random.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're in the grow room, if you've
got a bunch of sticks, if you're using
[SPEAKER_06]: sticks in there to support your plants,
watch your eyes around those sticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw somebody bend over the other day to
take care of a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: If he wasn't paying attention,
that stick would have gone way far into
[SPEAKER_06]: his eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of poked his eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't hurt him because he saw it
coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: He saw it because it literally went into
his eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was kneeling down, put the stick right
into his eye, didn't fuck him up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He survived.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be just fine, but I don't want that
to happen to any of my listeners or any of
[SPEAKER_06]: my friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be very aware of those sticks in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't use the sticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my personal grow, I like a tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the commercial grow, we like to use the
big trellis nets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I have used the sticks before
and I'll probably use them again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not my preferred method at this
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were using them, I do recommend
that you watch your eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since I'm talking about grow room safety,
here's another thing you should think
[SPEAKER_06]: about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have a smoke detector inside of
each grow room and you should also have a
[SPEAKER_06]: fire extinguisher on the exterior of each
grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't put your fire extinguisher inside
the grow room because if there is a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem in there, you don't want to have
to kick down the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go in there and get your fire extinguisher
and try to put the fire out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want that fire extinguisher on the
outside by the door so that if something's
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong, you can kick the door down,
spray the fuck out of that fire,
[SPEAKER_06]: solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are
a big advantage for your grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that shit in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys, I think that's all I've
got for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty soon, I've got Jesse coming back
for another outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse, if you're listening, it is time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can bring the boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do a swap cast.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know what a swap cast is,
I'm going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse and 44 and Dirty D, they have a
podcast called the Colorado Dope Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have them come on here,
all three of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll record one podcast and we will both
put it out on our feeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do a Colorado Dope Grow From Your
Heart podcast combination.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about growing dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about Colorado life and then
we'll both put it up on our feeds and I'll
[SPEAKER_06]: expose my audience to the Colorado Dope
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Colorado Dope Podcast will expose
their audience to myself and the Grow From
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be good for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the future, we'll get Jesse and the
crew on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are listening, this is the
invitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get you here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, it is time to get Mike and Lindsey
back so we can talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_06]: about politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you two are listening, start doing your
homework, get an episode prepared.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you back on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, that's all I have got for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would appreciate is if you go to
iTunes, find the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_06]: search for the Grow From Your Heart

[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even asking for five stars.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to go and click what you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_06]: After that, type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know what you think of the show and
I will read your comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on a future episode.

[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for episode number 132 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_06]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_06]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_06]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_06]: for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends call me Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_06]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, Mystic Roots is on tour this
spring.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're touring around with Catch a Fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing five or six shows in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be at the Colorado Spring Show at
the Black Sheep for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a good chance I'll be at some of
the Denver shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot commit to any of that right now,
but I will definitely be at the show at
[SPEAKER_06]: the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look forward to seeing the Mystic Roots
band there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody stay positive and get down.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you guys are having a great week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am having a wonderful week.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hot as shit here today in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is the hottest day of the year that
we've had so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hit 80 degrees in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was over 80 degrees today in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the first day I got sweaty.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the first day it actually got a
little bit hot in the large grow and I
[SPEAKER_06]: thought, hold the shit, it's warm in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to start making those summer
adjustments in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Start thinking about air conditioning and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, maybe we need to do an episode
on doing the season switch.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do some important announcements.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, The Secret Sesh is coming back
to Denver on May 19th.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret Sesh brought to you by Gatsby
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want more information on The Secret
Sesh in Denver, Colorado on May 19th,
[SPEAKER_06]: all you have to do is follow at Secret
Sesh Colorado on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret Sesh CEO on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I cannot get you tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot get you passes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get you on the list.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot do anything to help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am simply blessed to be at the event
myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the people that asked me for help,
all the people that sent me text messages,
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you right now, I can't do shit
to get you into that event.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get on the list, make your reservations,
pay your dues.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take some fat dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby for throwing
this event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, a huge shout out to Adam Ill for
coming from California to host this event
[SPEAKER_06]: for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love, much respect to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without Adam Ill, this podcast may not
have happened, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam Ill kind of inspired me to do a show.
[SPEAKER_06]: He quit doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt an absence.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a couple other podcasts that
inspired, but Adam Ill had a huge part.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big respect, much love to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, I'm going to turn
down this music here and we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: talk a little bit about, let's see,
I've been growing in cocoa lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've made the switch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran a few pots at the Big Grow with
nothing but cocoa in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am really liking it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like I'm watering a little bit
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one thing I've noticed is that I
cannot overwater the plants that are in
[SPEAKER_06]: the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing a couple of experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got one pot set aside from all the
other pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I water, I give this one pot
double or triple what every other plant
[SPEAKER_06]: gets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does not ever show signs of stress
from being overwatered.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some times when I know I'm not
going to get back to the grow first thing
[SPEAKER_06]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will just heavily, heavily water
those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I felt like when I was running soil,
sometimes I would flood those plants so
[SPEAKER_06]: much that I could see them getting droopy
and being angry from being overwatered.
[SPEAKER_06]: That never happens with the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm able to flood these plants and they
don't get pissed off from being
[SPEAKER_06]: overwatered.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does feel like on my regular
watering schedule, I need to hit them a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit more frequently.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had to increase the amount of water
that I give them because they are drying
[SPEAKER_06]: out a little bit more quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I've noticed with cocoa,
one thing I should mention with cocoa,
[SPEAKER_06]: there are no nutrients in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're just using street cocoa,
there's nothing there to keep your plant
[SPEAKER_06]: going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to need to feed it
nutrients almost every watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been giving it lots of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I water the plants twice a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do nutrients, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's two waters in one day, nutrients,
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next day I'll go nutrients,
nutrients, and then I'll go nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the watering before I leave on
the third day, I usually just hit them
[SPEAKER_06]: with clean water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're getting a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any over nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't look mad from being
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really liking the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, one thing I should mention,
don't let your cocoa dry out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you see the top layer of cocoa drying
out, that's when you're in danger of your
[SPEAKER_06]: plants getting a little bit too dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens very quickly in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: The timeframe, when you walk in to a soil
grow and you see your plants drooping,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're kind of starting to get pissed
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're drooping in cocoa, they're
fucking angry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing some experiments and I'm
learning so that you guys don't have to
[SPEAKER_06]: kill plants to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got more access.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got more space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're learning with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This kind of segues into something else I
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Overwatering.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of people and a lot of grows
overwatering their plants and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: wondering why the growth of their plant is
stunted.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something that happens when the
soil starts to dry out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_06]: or when your medium starts to dry out a
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The moisture to oxygen ratio in there
really makes your roots want to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really makes your roots want to eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they start searching for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: They start growing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This really makes your plants get active.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have noticed that when I use to run
clones in root cubes or rockwool,
[SPEAKER_06]: I would notice that my clones would
actually root the best when I would forget
[SPEAKER_06]: about them and the rockwool cube would dry
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think that that dryness is what
the plants are looking for a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more than the wetness.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to be soggy all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of a good idea to give your
plants a short dry out period.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want them getting wilty and
crispy, but keep an eye on your plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Water your plants thoroughly and then keep
an eye on them and watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see right when they start to droop
a little bit, that's when you need to give
[SPEAKER_06]: them water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So start learning right before that
happens and then start feeding them right
[SPEAKER_06]: before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right before they start to droop,
that's when you should be giving them
[SPEAKER_06]: water every time so that you allow that
dry out phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that happens in that dry out
phase that we've talked about on this
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast several episodes back,
as the moisture level in your root zone
[SPEAKER_06]: changes, as the water level in your soil
ball and your cocoa area, as that moisture
[SPEAKER_06]: level changes, so will the pH.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're feeding your plants a
nutrient solution, that's real high in pH,
[SPEAKER_06]: you pour it in there, only certain
nutrients are going to be available at
[SPEAKER_06]: that pH level.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as the moisture level and temperature
change inside of that soil ball,
[SPEAKER_06]: inside that rhizosphere, inside your pot
in your container there, the pH will
[SPEAKER_06]: change and different nutrients will become
bioavailable to your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are several advantages to letting
your plants dry out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want you to let them get crispy,
but it is good for your plants to dry out
[SPEAKER_06]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see much more production.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why I like to put my mother plants
in root pots or air pots or earth pots,
[SPEAKER_06]: any type of fabric pot that they can
breathe a whole bunch, or they make those
[SPEAKER_06]: plastic pots that have a bunch of holes in
them that have like the dimple shapes on
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like that because I feel like
your roots get a lot of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you're using that and cocoa,
your roots are going to be surrounded by
[SPEAKER_06]: oxygen and they're going to grow rapidly
and your plants will love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is my take on cocoa and kind of a
segue into letting your plants dry out a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love cocoa, you got to use more
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: You definitely need more cow and more mag
with cocoa, more cow mag heavily with
[SPEAKER_06]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you're using soil or cocoa or
a soil, this makes us a good idea to kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of let your plants dry up just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that was a quick talk,
quick ramble about how I feel about cocoa
[SPEAKER_06]: and what I've learned about letting the
plants dry a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move into the next part.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk about collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, yesterday I spent a couple of
hours working with a male plant if you've
[SPEAKER_06]: been following my social media,
you know that I've got an Arise male from
[SPEAKER_06]: Arise F1 seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is a male plant that looks like a true
stud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I plan on using him as my breeding stud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took him to about eight weeks of flower
in a flowering room to see what he would
[SPEAKER_06]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yesterday I cut him down, but before I
did, I collected the pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now here is how I collected the pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are several methods to doing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually used a couple of different
techniques to see what I liked better just
[SPEAKER_06]: because I wanted to talk about it on the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way I started, you guys, I was holding
a mason jar and I was just going to the
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom buds and I grabbed a drumstick
because I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grabbed a drumstick and I was just
tapping the male buds over the jar and
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen was falling into the jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I liked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was working, but I felt that a bunch of
the pollen was missing the jar as I was
[SPEAKER_06]: tapping the bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollen was falling down the side of the
jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollen was falling on my hand,
the side of the bud that didn't have a jar
[SPEAKER_06]: near it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was just pollen falling onto the
floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was plenty of pollen collected,
but I felt like I was wasting a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had this jar and I'm just tapping
buds and I'm tapping the buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pollen into the jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next method that I tried was I cut the
buds off of the plant and I just laid the
[SPEAKER_06]: male flowers, the buds with the male
flowers onto a glass tray.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was just tapping them with my
finger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I was noticing was a bunch more
pollen was falling off and landing
[SPEAKER_06]: directly onto the tray.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wasn't losing as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only problem there was I was gathering
a whole bunch of male flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I had to do was sift out the male
flowers from the pollen because you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to leave those male flowers in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you store it with those male flowers in
there, there is a chance that those male
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers have moisture in them and they
will mildew up inside of your jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And moisture is one of your biggest
enemies to pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about that here in
just a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I found to be the most successful
was just chop the top right off the male
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I set it on a glass tray and just
tapped it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just tapped it for a couple of good
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was tapping it kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I could just see the pollen
falling out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I turned it over and did it
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I picked it up and kind of tapped it
with my finger to knock off any pollen
[SPEAKER_06]: that's stuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just threw that big old pollen,
what did I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pollen removed bud, just threw that
part right into the trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I felt that setting it on the tray and
tapping it was my best method for
[SPEAKER_06]: collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I did get all those male plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just used, it felt kind of sketchy,
but I just used an old ID on a plate and
[SPEAKER_06]: just separated the male flowers from the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of felt like a cross between when
you used to pick seeds out of shwagweed
[SPEAKER_06]: and also when you used to use a credit
card to do bad drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a weird feeling, but it was
definitely, it worked, it worked very
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got a mason jar with a nice like
two inch layer of a rise pollen in the
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do plan on making some crosses with
the rise.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also plan on making a rise F2 in the
future here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So look out for some seeds coming up for
my re-genetics in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll need some testers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need you guys to run those for me and
tell me what they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get a bunch of messages from
people that want to be testers.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could deal with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very selective on testers,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it comes time to test seeds,
you need to have an impressive resume if
[SPEAKER_06]: you want to be a tester for me,
because I need to know what's truly going
[SPEAKER_06]: on with these plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need reliable testers.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the time comes, I will talk about
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not time for testers yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another method that I was using to try to
collect the pollen that I didn't find to
[SPEAKER_06]: be very successful was I was cutting the
branch off that had the male flowers on it
[SPEAKER_06]: and just cutting it into six or eight inch
sections and holding, actually kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: dipping that into a mason jar and then
tapping it at the base of the stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was working, but I was not able to
knock off enough pollen to make it worth
[SPEAKER_06]: my time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was also knocking off a bunch of
male flowers into the mason jar,
[SPEAKER_06]: which meant that I had to pour that back
out onto the plate anyway to sift it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't really, I didn't find it to
be effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the best method was to put,
if you've got a giant mirror or if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: a drummer and you've got an old kick drum
head, just drop a nug, the male plant
[SPEAKER_06]: right down onto the giant mirror and just
tap on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all the pollen will fall off and
then use a credit card or an old ID just
[SPEAKER_06]: to scrape it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy to collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you've got your pollen,
you're going to need to store your pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I recommend putting it in a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I like to put that mason jar in a
brown paper bag to keep it dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I put all of that inside of the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_06]: Carefully label your jars of pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: My jar says a RISE F1 pollen collected
five, five, 16.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's easy enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that that's a RISE pollen and I
know when it was collected.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really tried to store pollen
for too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always use it kind of soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could imagine it would last a few months
maybe, but I'm honestly not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's properly stored six months,
maybe a year, I don't want to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got information on how long,
if you've had pollen stored for a long
[SPEAKER_06]: time and you used it and it worked,
send me an email,
[SPEAKER_06]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to hear your pollen methods on how
long and how you apply pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know how long you keep it before
you apply it and what the oldest viable
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen you ever had was.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've collected a bunch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got it in a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's well labeled.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been stored in the fridge for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's something I must mention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not get your pollen wet in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: Moisture is pollen's worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people ask me, they're like,
bro, you breed and you grow seedless
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers in the same facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you scared having that male flower
around or that male plant around that's
[SPEAKER_06]: just spitting pollen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you worried about seeding up all of
your females?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes shit happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I have grown crops that were
meant to be seedless and I've accidentally
[SPEAKER_06]: discovered a whole bunch of seeds in there
and it was because I had a male plant in
[SPEAKER_06]: the same area and it just got cross
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the secret is water deactivates
pollen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got two separate areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's got a male plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's got female plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: The female plants are in flower and
completely able to accept pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still in their ovulation phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can accept pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can become seeded.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to grow long enough to make
viable seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that I prevent them from being
seeded when I mess with my male plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yesterday I was playing with a male
plant about 30 feet away from those female
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did was I took my backpack sprayer
that I would apply pesticides or foliar
[SPEAKER_06]: feed in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just mixed up some water in there,
just straight clean water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pHed it at 6.5 and I sprayed that all
over my female plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I went and I played with my male
plant in a separate area.
[SPEAKER_06]: I collected all the pollen from him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw away all the trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw away the pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw away the container.
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw away all the dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I swept up that room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cleaned up the room where the male was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I took the clothes that I was wearing
and I walked straight to a washing
[SPEAKER_06]: machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took the clothes off and threw them into
a washing machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I walked myself directly to a shower
and I hosed myself down, including,
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys, I am six foot five and I have
got dreadlocks almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_06]: My dreadlocks are mid thigh region.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had to run to a shower and just
rinse my whole self down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had to go wash the dreads.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go wash the beard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just went and scrubbed myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that the water I applied to those
female plants made them unable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little bit of birth control.
[SPEAKER_06]: It made them unable to collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pollen was not allowed to land on the
pistol and move into the ovule because the
[SPEAKER_06]: water was in the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also feel that any water or any pollen
that was on myself or my clothes was
[SPEAKER_06]: destroyed as soon as it hit the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I carried those clothes up to the washing
machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw them in the washing machine,
turned on the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the hat that I was wearing got thrown
into that washing machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the clothes got washed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The hat got washed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the dreadlocks got washed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got washed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then before I went back into the grow
room with the females, I went and grabbed
[SPEAKER_06]: my sprayer again and I sprayed it in front
of me as I walked into that room.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was water landing on those plants
before I got into there is kind of what I
[SPEAKER_06]: was aiming for.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure that these plants will not
be seeded, the female plants that I was
[SPEAKER_06]: messing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yesterday after I played with my male
plant, I went and took pictures of the
[SPEAKER_06]: girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am 99% sure that I did not seed them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about water, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen people set up a screen,
like a screen door.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you open up your grow room door and
then there's a screen door and they've got
[SPEAKER_06]: water running down that screen door.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little mister spring water right
at the top and it collects on the screen
[SPEAKER_06]: and runs down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is their pollen catch.
[SPEAKER_06]: They also sell a UV light that will kill
pollen that goes in your ducting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if pollen comes in, it goes through
this UV light that goes through your
[SPEAKER_06]: ducting and then it is just killed right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's neutralized.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pollen isn't as scary as water.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a lot of people like to think,
water will destroy pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're afraid of pollinating your
plants, just apply a little bit of water
[SPEAKER_06]: and you should be safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are playing with pollen and
female plants and male plants in a small
[SPEAKER_06]: area, in a house, in a home grow,
the first couple of times expect to get
[SPEAKER_06]: some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes one little tiny speck of pollen
to make a seed and pollen is so tiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get it all off of you unless you
kind of have some experience and know what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't be surprised if you pollinate
your crop on accident.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have been going for 17 minutes
now and you can hear the dryness in my
[SPEAKER_06]: throat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to take a quick drink and a
couple of dabs and I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm well hydrated and well medicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to give a huge shout out to my
friends at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to the whole Turpex crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now I am dabbing some cactus
cookies, cream, a shatter made by the
[SPEAKER_06]: friends at Turpex and this stuff tastes
delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also props to the grower, whoever grew
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not bragging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever did the growing here, they did a
really nice job.
[SPEAKER_06]: So great work, great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always pick up your Turpex
shatter, your Turpex live resin,
[SPEAKER_06]: your Turpex waxes, your Turpex butters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get your Turpex products at
Green and Healthy Wellness at 430 West
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado and Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a medical only facility so you do
need your medical marijuana recommendation
[SPEAKER_06]: to shop there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of you may know that I am a
consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do consulting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I help people build grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: I help them get their grow rooms going.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a problem in your grow,
you can contact me, pay me a small fee.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will come to your garden and check out
your grow and tell you what's going on and
[SPEAKER_06]: tell you what's wrong and help you correct
and improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So recently I was called to a place where
this guy had powdery mildew and he could
[SPEAKER_06]: not figure out what was causing the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem was that he was not getting
rid of his old stale air.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to remove the stagnant air from
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get rid of that extra
humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get rid of that old moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get it out of the room and get
some fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy is failing to do that in his area
and he is getting powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've tried a few things to get rid of the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've applied a couple of products that
seem to be working, but unfortunately he
[SPEAKER_06]: had to harvest a little bit early because
the PM was overtaking a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me tell you a little bit about what
we tried to get rid of this powdery
[SPEAKER_06]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: A while back when I first discovered the
powdery mildew in this guy's garden,
[SPEAKER_06]: I started applying a product called stylet
oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's JMS stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seemed to be working very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was knocking the PM off of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't see any on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't come back for quite some time,
but we had to keep spraying it about once
[SPEAKER_06]: a week to keep the PM away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really didn't want to spray this
stuff on heavy chunky buds because I could
[SPEAKER_06]: tell it was leaving a little bit of an oil
on the plants, which was actually the main
[SPEAKER_06]: ingredient that was stopping the PM.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't want to put this oil all
over his bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't like spraying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I researched another product and I was
recommended big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big time exterminator is 90 or is mostly a
citric acid or citric oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember which one it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's citric acid and it works very
well at keeping insects away.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes the plants look really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also took the powdery mildew off of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, this product only works to
keep the powdery mildew at bay for about
[SPEAKER_06]: three to five days at a time before we
would start seeing little speckles pop up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was getting closer to harvest and I
wanted to try something a little bit more
[SPEAKER_06]: extreme.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were ready to go extreme.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not want to use Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am trying to only use products that are
allowed by the MED in my personal grow and
[SPEAKER_06]: in my caregiver grows and in my consultant
grows just because it's easier to have one
[SPEAKER_06]: playing field.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will not use Eagle 20 in this
garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did use was I got 30% hydrogen
peroxide and I filled up a four gallon
[SPEAKER_06]: pump sprayer and I put 20 milliliters per
gallon of 30% hydrogen peroxide in this
[SPEAKER_06]: water and I adjusted the pH and I soaked
all of the plants with this hydrogen
[SPEAKER_06]: peroxide solution and it took off most of
the powdery mildew and it did not come
[SPEAKER_06]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, there was one plant in the
back corner where the powdery mildew had
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of taken over and I didn't see it was
so bad back there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't spray enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did not take off the powdery mildew on
one plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my friend harvested most of his plants
didn't show signs of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one plant that did have powdery
mildew, I found a solution online.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Jorge Cervantes taught us about
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a five gallon bucket and I put 50
milliliters of the 30% hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_06]: in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever you were messing with this
hydrogen peroxide, be sure to wear rubber
[SPEAKER_06]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need some latex gloves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to get this stuff on your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll burn your fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on what kind of skin you've got,
it can mess up your fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a white guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I dribbled some on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It made my fingers look bleached white.
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine if you don't have working hands,
if you've got some softer, more gentle
[SPEAKER_06]: hands, it probably could burn your skin
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure you wear gloves when you're
using the hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mix your 50 milliliters of hydrogen
peroxide into a five gallon bucket of
[SPEAKER_06]: water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys, this may sound crazy,
but I chopped the buds off of this plant
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was dunking them directly into the
water and swishing them around for about
[SPEAKER_06]: five to seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just swishing it under the water with the
peroxide in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would cut off most of the leaf,
you guys, most of the larger leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd give it a little pre-trim and then I
would dunk the bud into the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_06]: peroxide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was hanging it on a line with a
flat fan, an oscillating fan blowing near
[SPEAKER_06]: it constantly to dry these buds out as
quickly, not dry them, but to get the
[SPEAKER_06]: water out of them as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I left the fan on there for two to three
hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then toward the end of the day,
I just turned the fan to where it wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: blowing directly on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I gave all the buds a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot tell the difference between the
buds that I dunked in the solution and the
[SPEAKER_06]: buds that weren't not dunked.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part is the buds I dunked show
zero signs of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this is something you want
to try at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not something I would do in my
garden, but I saw it work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I smoke this product,
it's not ready to smoke yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be ready in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am 90% sure that I'm not going to notice
any of the peroxide solution in these
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it may sound completely crazy,
but if you've got a plant that's got to be
[SPEAKER_06]: harvested and it's got a little bit of
powdery mildew on it, the best solution is
[SPEAKER_06]: to get a five gallon bucket, some water,
and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide and
[SPEAKER_06]: go ahead and dunk those buds in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave them in there for five or six
seconds, pull them out, hang them up,
[SPEAKER_06]: put a fan on them, and try to start
getting them dry safely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once they get dried out from that
water you just put in there, you're just
[SPEAKER_06]: drying them just like normal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would dry and cure them just like any
other flowers that you've cut down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that helps save your crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: The most important part, you guys,
if you're getting powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_06]: you need to correct the issue in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something is causing that powdery mildew
to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are not getting enough air flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: In there, I highly recommend heavily
defoliating your plants, take off all the
[SPEAKER_06]: extra leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will prevent PM.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be less surface area for the PM
to build up on.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got two leaves that are on top
of each other, one leaf lays on top of
[SPEAKER_06]: another, and you get that little water
layer underneath there, that will
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually turn into powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your plants are sweating on top of each
other, and that sweaty space is the
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect environment to create some PM.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, another thing that we are
experimenting with, I need to get with my
[SPEAKER_06]: friend that's got this product,
but he recently bought the Clean Light.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the Clean Light is, it is a UV light
that is designed for the strawberry
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and the pumpkin industry,
because strawberries and pumpkins
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently get powdery mildew very
heavily.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they take this light, and they hold it
three to four inches above the plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they just move this ultraviolet light
around, and this light supposedly kills
[SPEAKER_06]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend just got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's only used it a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: They say it takes about a week of constant
use, of consistent use to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_06]: PM, but I will check with him in a few
days, and we will see if this has cured
[SPEAKER_06]: his powdery mildew problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, since I'm talking about PM,
I have a theory.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like CBD-rich plants seem to be
more susceptible to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's something in the THC that
gives it resistance to PM, and I do plan
[SPEAKER_06]: on talking to Fox a little bit more about
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next time I have Fox on,
that will definitely be one of my topics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Fox, we got to get you on the show
soon, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the guys from the Colorado podcast,
this is the second time I told you we got
[SPEAKER_06]: to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to get Jesse and his crew back in
