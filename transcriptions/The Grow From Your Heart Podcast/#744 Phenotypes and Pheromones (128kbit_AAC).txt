[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be a part of the community going
to hang out with the community meet a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of friends see a lot of people join us the
Dude Grows Cup I've said more than enough
[SPEAKER_00]: all right I did say that I've got a bunch
of great emails printed here in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: me where do I start how about this one
because it is on the top of the list this
[SPEAKER_00]: email came from my friend John this one
came to us on the grow help tab at
[SPEAKER_00]: eyriegenetics.com that's right if you go
to the website eyriegenetics.com there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow help tab on there when you click on
that grow help tab it does give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to answer a few preliminary
questions I ask what are you growing are
[SPEAKER_00]: you growing indoors or outdoors what's
your temperature what's your humidity what
[SPEAKER_00]: are you feeding this plant I ask several
questions that gives me an idea of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer your questions people will send me
a question they'll say hey my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow what do I do and I've got 20
questions we've kind of cut to the chase
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask some of those so that I've got
some info a little bit of a triage a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a checkup if you will so
before we get to the main question I ask a
[SPEAKER_00]: few questions our friend John here asked a
very simple question so we don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know about his plants his grow room this
one came from my friend John this is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow help tab of course and it goes a
lot like this it says hey quick question
[SPEAKER_00]: for you what strains were bred with the e
phenotype of a rise that is a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: question there's a lot to talk about here
first of all what does John mean when he
[SPEAKER_00]: says the e phenotype of a rise let's talk
about that I am known well maybe I'm not I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to think that my strain my brand is
known for a strain known as a rise I made
[SPEAKER_00]: a rise f1s I took a golden goat female and
a daybreaker male and I made some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and I named those a rise now out of that
batch of arise seeds I ran a lot of them I
[SPEAKER_00]: ran thousands of those myself and I found
several keepers I found the King Solomon
[SPEAKER_00]: male King Solomon my stud male the male
that makes my line really potent and
[SPEAKER_00]: popular is known as King Solomon he is a
selected phenotype from the arise line so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a male that got called King
Solomon there's another male that is known
[SPEAKER_00]: as the golden goat dominant male it
doesn't have a real name I just call it
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat male because it's not for
sale nobody else touches it nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it but me that's the golden goat male
it's over there that is the one that is
[SPEAKER_00]: used to make the golden goat back cross so
those are the two males that I kept out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that also there were several stellar
females that stood out in the arise line
[SPEAKER_00]: when I would grow them we see what is
known as phenotypical expression not all
[SPEAKER_00]: two seeds will grow the same especially in
an f1 or a poly hybrid so when you cross a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant when you cross two plants you got a
male and a female right the offspring are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to show some mommy traits some daddy
traits some of them may show grandparent
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and then some may be right in the
middle you never know what ratios you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get until you do the breeding so
that is where phenotypical expression
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in some of these plants were taller
some of them were skinnier some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: were more squat some were real branchy
some of them were super potent some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them were not as potent these are the
different phenotypes I was finding as I
[SPEAKER_00]: was growing these plants different
expressions of the genes maybe that's
[SPEAKER_00]: different genotypes and phenotype is the
expression of the room so I was finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the different phenos and genotypes now I
was labeling these plants really basically
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew they were called arise because I
named it it was mine so as I grew seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetically maybe I had a five maybe I
had a hundred pack of seeds as I would
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them as I would plant them I would
just number them arise number one arise
[SPEAKER_00]: number two arise number three up to the
number that I was using so I did letters
[SPEAKER_00]: the next time and it was probably a
through like G or somewhere that's like 13
[SPEAKER_00]: right get 13 14 maybe 20 down the alphabet
is as far as I'd usually go so that is
[SPEAKER_00]: where the arise E comes from we have found
a specific phenotype that I kept it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just a plant that I went I like that one
and the cup or the pot or the label
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to be labeled arise number and I
know it's a letter but it's arise number E
[SPEAKER_00]: so I kept that one because I liked it for
a specific reason that is where the letter
[SPEAKER_00]: schemes come from now let's talk about
these arise letter indications there was
[SPEAKER_00]: arise number four there was number seven
there was number eight there is number E
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was number A were my five
favorites of all time growing thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of arise then there were the two
males of course the King Solomon and the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat looking male so I've got seven
that stuck around at this time I have
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated all of the females except
number four number four is a stud not a
[SPEAKER_00]: stud number four is a champion if it was a
stud it'd be a dude number four is fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome number four is an amazing plant
number four is a keeper it's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency that I look for it's got the vigor
that I look for it's got the bud density
[SPEAKER_00]: and shape and type that I look for it's
got leaf shape that I look for it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: plant structure it is the champion it does
all of the things that I wanted my arise
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to do so number four has stuck
around number four was the the perfect one
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even do is the one that was the
one I'm gonna try to remember off the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of my head here number eight was good it
was more golden goatee and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more sativa number E I think was the super
real tall real long finisher real
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic finishing phenotype so I don't
have a list of which phenotype was which
[SPEAKER_00]: here it's a it's a lot to remember when
you get into breeding a lot of strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to remember specific phenos but
that is where the letters come from so
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see this in other breeders you'll
see it in my work a lot of time you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: arise so there's right now available and
this is what my friend inspired our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: John's question right now available is
arise F2 number four and arise F2 number E
[SPEAKER_00]: and arise F2 number seven those have been
distributed and shared with friends I
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't say available because those are
probably gone by the time you hear this
[SPEAKER_00]: but those have been made and our friends
are getting those so why did I call them
[SPEAKER_00]: F2 number E because I probably used the
same male in a batch right I got the one
[SPEAKER_00]: male it was King Solomon and then I had
five different females of arise in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were all labeled the different
phenotypes from which they came from from
[SPEAKER_00]: their original phenohaunt so there was
arise F1 number four arise F1 number two
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up there were five of them
that were selected we had number four
[SPEAKER_00]: number seven number eight numbers A and
number E and then those all got pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the King Solomon to make the F2 and now
that became arise F2 number A or arise
[SPEAKER_00]: number A F2 I'm not sure how I labeled it
either way as long as the F2 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: number A is indicated in there that is to
let you know let the consumer know which
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype of the female I use which female
phenotype of the arise I use because it
[SPEAKER_00]: will make a difference the number four
will stay shorter and squatty or the E is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get real tall like a fishing pole so
that does make a difference you've also
[SPEAKER_00]: seen me do this in the Jack the Ripper F2s
there are Jack the Ripper F2 number two
[SPEAKER_00]: number three number four and number five I
believe is how I numbered those so those
[SPEAKER_00]: are also available with different numbers
you'll see another seed company we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna bring anybody else's names into this
but you'll see they do version A and
[SPEAKER_00]: version B which is just simply probably
I'm assuming they had a they grew from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed they found two really stellar keepers
that were different but they were both
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers for different reasons so they bred
them to the same male so let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've got I grow a batch of seeds and
I find two stellar females one is super
[SPEAKER_00]: potent and really super potent we'll just
focus on the potency of this one and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another one that fucking tastes
super good so I've got a version A and a
[SPEAKER_00]: version B as long as I make a note of
which is which then it's cool to have two
[SPEAKER_00]: different versions not a big deal you
could sell them both advertise them both
[SPEAKER_00]: market them both grow them both as long as
people know what they're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor or the potency then what's to stop
me from taking a male one male and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating both of them and offering the
version A and version B of the same cross
[SPEAKER_00]: we could name it the same thing you could
call it fist bump that that's a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name don't fucking steal that fist
bump I'm claiming that strain name that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be fist bump version one and fist
bump version two that wouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem just list what the parents were
and that's two different two different
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses of the same thing basically so
that is why we see letters in there thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for inspiring me to ramble and rant
about letters and weird seed package
[SPEAKER_00]: labels I hope I covered some ground there
and I hope any of that was useful to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of you folks out there who may have seed
packs with version two or version B or
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype a written on the package that's
why we're doing it the breeder is trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you as much detailed information
as we can share with you on the package to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you know what you're working with
I'd like you to know what you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with I'd like to know what I'm working
with it makes it easy set yourself up for
[SPEAKER_00]: success all right I am rambling let's keep
me back on track and move to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: message this one is great this one came
from our friend Mark and it goes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: like this it says yo Rasta Jeff I just
watched your show about reversing male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and I was curious if female plants
can detect a male plant nearby and if so
[SPEAKER_00]: how is it a pheromone the male plant emits
or is it something else thanks for all you
[SPEAKER_00]: do and I will give my mom a hug kind
regards from Mark this is a great question
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any scientific data any real
evidence other than observation personal
[SPEAKER_00]: observation I've been growing for years
I've been cultivating in small scales and
[SPEAKER_00]: large scales for a long time I have had
the privilege of having male plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same room same house as female plants and
attempting and successfully finishing a
[SPEAKER_00]: seedless since Amia crop in one room while
pollinating another crop in another room
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same house so the evidence that I
do have may may be useful the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: report I have may be useful but this is
what I have observed when I do have
[SPEAKER_00]: females in one room and they are waiting
for pollen and they know there's a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the other room who's starting to
skeet I do believe and I do see those
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants flowering more quickly and
producing more pistols it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting off more spaces to receive
the pollen I've seen this a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: times I feel like they get stickier they
get more pistols and they do grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly I don't know what causes it I will
give you credit for the idea or the
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption that it's a pheromone or
something similar because that would make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense when I smell my girl come into the
room I do get excited so maybe that boy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant maybe those girl plants know the
other one is there and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling each other and just getting horny
and starting to make more flowers so that
[SPEAKER_00]: the magic can happen also I do notice that
if I'm just collecting pollen and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no females around the dudes don't produce
as much pollen as they would if there were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually females in the room that's
something else that I have noticed so I do
[SPEAKER_00]: think the plants know that they are there
I think the plants can detect the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of the opposite sex I think they can
detect the presence of other plants I also
[SPEAKER_00]: think they can detect the presence of
pests and the presence of us I've said it
[SPEAKER_00]: before those plants think that I'm just
the delivery mechanism the delivery guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows up with cow mag that's all the
plants think that I'm there for they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like is he here he's got the cow mag yay
that's that's all the plants think about
[SPEAKER_00]: me and they're grateful that I gave it to
him so I do think that the plants know I
[SPEAKER_00]: do think they get stickier I think they
start flowering more quickly and they do
[SPEAKER_00]: get more pistols so I think that's a great
answer to your question I don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of scientific evidence behind that other
than I've bred in the same house and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the plants get stickier because I
think they knew that their date was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side of the room just getting
prepped for him she's over there putting
[SPEAKER_00]: on her perfume and shaving her legs and
that dude is over there doing push-ups
[SPEAKER_00]: until we introduced him all right that is
enough of that one I've been rambling on
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one more great question that I did
receive I did not print it because my
[SPEAKER_00]: printer ran out of paper so I just took a
quick note of it this one said hey Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff why is some stuff only available in
femseed and other lines are only available
[SPEAKER_00]: in regular seeds that is a very good
question as a seed breeder I've got a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good answer for that why is some stuff
only available let's start off with
[SPEAKER_00]: femseed that is the easiest answer why is
some stuff only available in fems I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to start off by teaching you about what is
known as a clone only golden goat is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call a clone only when the maker the
original breeder of golden goat who was
[SPEAKER_00]: not me I've got to give mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: dank in Topeka Kansas credit for breeding
the golden goat I did not breed that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people give me the credit did not do it
don't want the credit I made enough of my
[SPEAKER_00]: own stuff don't need to steal credit for
that one however golden goat is a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: only which means when the original breeder
made the golden goat they did not give out
[SPEAKER_00]: any clones or seeds of other phenotypes of
that cultivar they've got so the breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: made a handful of seeds right he grew them
he found the winner he shared that one did
[SPEAKER_00]: not give anything else out there are no
seeds to be had of the golden goat so it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a clone only there's that one female
clone which means there is no real true
[SPEAKER_00]: male golden goat plant which brings us to
why there are only fem seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if you only had one rhinoceros and
it was a female make more rhinos you need
[SPEAKER_00]: some sperm or a male rhino to do that and
with golden goat there's only a female so
[SPEAKER_00]: we cannot make regular golden goat seeds
unless we adulterate it which I have taken
[SPEAKER_00]: the liberty of doing so I have pollinated
that with another plant we've done some
[SPEAKER_00]: work to it we have done what is known as a
back cross I've done full episodes on back
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing back crossing is the solution
when you want seeds of a plant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: only a clone only no male exists there are
ways to kind of replicate recreate what's
[SPEAKER_00]: it called reverse engineer may be the
better word to create a line that is non
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a clone only which has a no male
pollen donor available there are ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: work around that but that's an
adulteration that is not a pure version of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant so if we make feminized seeds
we only need that female plant because in
[SPEAKER_00]: a female pro in a feminized process I
would take we're gonna stick with golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat I would take a clone of the golden
goat I would take another clone of the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat these are both golden goat
clones I would treat one clone with a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution I've done a full episode on this
that solution would cause this golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to make pollen which is only female
pollen which also only contains golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat chromosome there's only the genetics
of golden goat so we are not adulterating
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat line I'm gonna take that
golden goat pollen and put it on a golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat female now we have made golden goat
s1 we have selfed our golden goat which
[SPEAKER_00]: all those seeds will be very very close to
the original golden goat so that is why
[SPEAKER_00]: some things are available only in
feminized seed because it was a clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: plant meaning there were no seeds which
means there was no male which means if we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to create a seed from that it
either needs to be selfed or adulterated
[SPEAKER_00]: and many people don't want the adulterated
version of golden goat they want the
[SPEAKER_00]: original pure version of golden goat now
let's talk about the other side of that
[SPEAKER_00]: coin many people are not fans of feminized
seeds back in the day many of the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: makers were not making femme seeds
properly quality control was not what it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be we figured it out now femmes are
a lot better but because of miseducation
[SPEAKER_00]: or trial and error that didn't go well
many growers are disgruntled or they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad taste in their mouth or they are
simply opposed to using femme seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: that same vein many breeders are opposed
to making feminized seeds many people that
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds feel like making femmes is kind
of a dead end what do you do if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: use a male you've got to keep reversing
something in my opinion that is fine I
[SPEAKER_00]: know a few other breeders that really
agree with the idea of using a an alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant something a really a badass
female plant could really make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: good breeding projects but a lot of
breeders don't agree with that they only
[SPEAKER_00]: want the natural selection of a male and
female plant so that is why a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things are only available in regular seed
because when you make a cross you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant and a female plant you put the
pollen on the female it makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds now you've got your cross that
happens naturally that is easy to do
[SPEAKER_00]: creating feminized seeds from that line is
a different line of work it involves
[SPEAKER_00]: treating a select it involves selecting a
plant to be a pollen donor it involves
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting female plants to receive that
pollen then it also involves treating the
[SPEAKER_00]: selected pollen donor with a chemical
solution a certain amount of times there's
[SPEAKER_00]: work to be done you've got to treat a
plant you've got to reverse it you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to do some manipulation then you've got to
make the pollen happen you've got to chuck
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen and then honestly when I make
reg seeds I get 50% more seed than I do
[SPEAKER_00]: when I make feminized seed that's why fem
seeds are twice as expensive they cost
[SPEAKER_00]: twice as much to make they take twice as
long to make so a lot of seeds are only
[SPEAKER_00]: available in reg seed because a feminized
grower a feminized breeder has not taken
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to create a feminized line from
that project or that product it's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother step it's a lot more work it could
be it could be six nine maybe twelve more
[SPEAKER_00]: months worth of work to get that feminized
line out to you so the reason why some
[SPEAKER_00]: things are available in femme is because
the breeder a breeder like myself that is
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in making femmes has done the
work to make the femme seeds available the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why some stuff is only available in
regs is because some breeders they either
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't done it yet or they are just not
interested in making stuff in regular seed
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the times that femme is because
it was only available as a clone only in
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way you're gonna get seeds of it
is through making femmes so I hope I
[SPEAKER_00]: answered that question I do have a lot of
other episodes about back crosses about
[SPEAKER_00]: femme seeds I do invite you to explore
those episodes if you have any more
