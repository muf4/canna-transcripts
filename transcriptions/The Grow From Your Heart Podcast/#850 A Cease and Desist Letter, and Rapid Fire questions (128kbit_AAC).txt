[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 850 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got another great episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do also want to remind you that there is
a fresh drop and a restock at iredirect
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check iredirect.com because I have
replenished many of the sold out items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of free seeds, if you spend
over $30 at iredirect.com, you do get a
[SPEAKER_00]: free two pack of feminized seeds at
iredirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you spend over $100, you get
another two pack of free feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does continue at $30, $100,
$200, $300, and $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you spend, the more freebies
you do get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, those freebies do stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spend $100, you get that $30
freebie and the $100 freebie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit iredirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that restock, check that replenish
and grab your freebies at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you may notice while you're
checking my websites is that there has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a change to a popular strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain that was named after the little
square chewy candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can no longer use that name that was
being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I can even say it right here
right now on the podcast without causing
[SPEAKER_00]: myself some trouble because we got a
little letter, more than a little letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an important letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an email that says we must cease
and desist from using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can say this in this phrase,
I think, without getting in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: From now on, we must cease and desist from
using anything with the word starburst in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can no longer use the word starburst in
any branding or advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very official letter here from
the great folks at Mars Wrigley.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that I will share with you says,
to protect Mars Wrigley's valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property and the consuming
public, Mars Wrigley must ensure that its
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark are not misused by third
parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess who I am?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a third party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using the word starburst in
branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, if you do that more,
it's going to cost you a lot of fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give them a lot of fucking
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to stop using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strain has been changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strain has actually been
discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't make it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been for sale for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the seeds are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not part of the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not part of the catalog any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: That problem has been solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were very clear about the names
that we can and cannot use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with Skittles, Starburst,
M&M's, Snickers, Twix, Lifesavers,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hubba Bubba, Milky Way, Three Musketeers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a long list of names that cannot
be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go on in another page to
make it clear that any form of Skittles or
[SPEAKER_00]: Starburst cannot be used in any
association with any other brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've spelled it about 45 different ways
in this paper just to let us know they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do go to any of my websites and
you see that that strain that was once
[SPEAKER_00]: named after that little tiny pink
delicious chewy candy, that strain name
[SPEAKER_00]: has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I got the old-fashioned cease
and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to change that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not up to anything fishy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a legal matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to take action quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to respond to them and let them know
that I was going to change it and how I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to correct this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I responded to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I think we're in the clear all as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just a, hey, fucker, stop before
we get you a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, fucker has stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they don't come to get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's move on to something more
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, the past weekend,
I got to go see my favorite band on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet for four nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go see the band Fish at Dick's
Sporting Goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know the real name of the
soccer field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Dick's Sporting Goods Event Center,
Sporting Goods Soccer Field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a gigantic soccer field in Denver,
Colorado, in Commerce City.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is owned, of course, by Dick's Sporting
Goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got the Dick's logo everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are Fish Dick's for four days,
and we love Dick's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make all the jokes you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to see Fish for four nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to say you went and
saw the same band four nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish will never do the same concert two
nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do anything similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was similar four nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did four completely different shows,
completely different vibes, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different songs, totally different energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it was based on the vibe of the
day, the vibe of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a different show every
single time at a fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen over a hundred fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved every one of them for its own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is I got to go see
Fish for four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't felt that free in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't felt that good, that iry,
that blessed in a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very good experience,
a very good, rewarding end of the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of starting to fall now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summer's wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more big party for the end of
the summer, but that was sort of toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrap up here for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one might be fall, because it
might be hoody season by the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do now is give a big shout
out to all of the beautiful people who
[SPEAKER_00]: said hello to me at the Fish concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walked by and just hailed iry and
put a thumbs up or a fist bump up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air, iry, bro, much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ran up and gave me a big old hug
and told me it was good to see me,
[SPEAKER_00]: great to see you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a fellow breeder and we traded
something, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a fellow breeder, we didn't
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps we just danced for a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2001, perhaps we got down
during that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a fellow breeder and you came to
say hello, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a little tiny dude that looks
like Boo Boo Bear and you came and gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: a big old hug, there's two people that
could qualify as holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if we saw each other at the Fish
concerts and we bumped into each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: shared energy, exchanged vibes in any way,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an honor, a blessing, a pleasure,
a privilege to see you at the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had such a good time this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I could ramble about the
concerts all weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you guys are here to hear about
ganja, learn about growing and cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not gonna gush too much over the
Fish shows, but I feel refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel revived.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody that I saw
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an old friend, a new friend,
if you're a Fish friend, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry friend, however we met,
however we know each other, if we shared a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment at Fish, big up, big fist bump,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say this a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know who I am, if you know what I
look like, I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dreadlocks touch my calves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually wear some pretty dope Nike
dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk up, say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear about it on Tuesday
like, hey bro, I saw you at a concert on
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have said hello, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, walk up, say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a shy guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to those shows to make friends and
it's a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there to go hang out alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I saw you there, fist bump,
and if you saw me and you didn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: hello, come say what's up next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been not all in my head during
the Fish shows, but nobody was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stare you right through you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll still say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch me on shakedown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've said hello to all my fish friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the cease and desist
letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reminded you about the restock at I read
direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it is time to introduce a new
part of the podcast that I'm not sure if I
[SPEAKER_00]: am excited or nervous about, but we're
going to learn together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions on the podcast
and I do promise that if I read your
[SPEAKER_00]: question here on the show, that I will
give you a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that I redirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has resulted in mountains of printed
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got stacks of paper in different
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all piled up all over this table
over here right off camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a looks like a paper
fortress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exaggerating, but I've got an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have told me that I talk too
damn much and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk too damn much, but that's why I've
got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to do is I'm going to try
to minimize the amount of rambling and
[SPEAKER_00]: chatter on these answers and questions and
I'm going to read a question and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to just bang out as many questions
as I can in the next few minutes and not
[SPEAKER_00]: give those long, ridiculous, long winded,
repetitive answers I like to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to do a rapid fire
question and answer podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get rapid fire until we
start shooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how much more time I want to
continue the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from now here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapid fire podcast questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These questions did come from my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs says grow help or grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab, you are given
the opportunity to send me a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a good grow question and I
do read that question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's a rapid fire quickie,
I will send you a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds from iReadDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first quickie came from somebody
who's going to be called Candyland Stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question quickly says, hey Rasta Jeff,
hey Candyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been growing about three
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have six strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years, six strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose these strains,
but I'm also getting kind of bored and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for a reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few are elite clones and a few are seeds
I personally popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm debating on a breeding project to
preserve the genetics and even make my own
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm torn between attempting to feminize
one of my six and pollinating the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: popping a pack of regs to search for a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking for some experience and
some experience guidance on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've already got plenty of plants and
you're thinking about popping another pack
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole new phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole new project that could
inspire some more inspiration and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: more passion to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't add more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do, and you're asking for my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this were my room, I were bored with
these plants, but I had a couple that I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is I would clone my
favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take two clones of the favorite
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would take all the other plants and
put them in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would reverse one clone of the favorite
and then I would pollinate everything with
[SPEAKER_00]: that reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've basically got that your
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that in preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the S1 of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've made R1s of everything else and
you're going to find those plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring that out by searching
through that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've basically got everything kind of
preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the others are adulterated,
but you've got something close to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's crossed to your favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've potentially just made six
batches of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you've got six, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you've got is the opportunity to
make six different feminized crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take your favorite plant,
take two cuts of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to become the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will become the receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other five favorites of your
plants, pollinate them, make seeds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got plenty of preservation for
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you're also going to do is
inspire yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to grow those seeds
and now you've given yourself some brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new inspiration, some new energy to go and
then you're not bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that reset won't be as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be more motivated to get over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm already rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question has gone on longer than I
truly intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I answered you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse your favorite and pollinate
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the quick answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, check your inbox because you
do have a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I read the next one, I do have to
remind you to click like and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you liked this episode, click like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see more, you know what to

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question came from somebody who
wants to be called John at Dank
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been enjoying listening to your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for just a few years and
I try to be like a sponge and soak up the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm skipping to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is, which of your
strains would be best for me to try?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to find something that is
osamine dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I tell you right away, I don't do a
lot of lab testing for terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't tell you what's got osamine,
but I can answer your question based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the data that you have given me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for a rec farm in Washington that
had a strain called Wi-Fi OG, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: fire OG to the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a lot of testing and found
that that had off the charts osamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you're looking for a plant
with osamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think would be similar or have
similar effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quick answer there is my doctor
mindbender cut has fire OG in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything with the doctor mindbender may
get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's got doctor mindbender or what's
going to be close to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What may get you there would be the Sunday
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also I've got a skunk tester crossed to
the doctor mindbender that is available on
[SPEAKER_00]: the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, doctor mindbender to skunk number one
testers are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at a very affordable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the website right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grab some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to get you close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the 4k has got the potential
to get you close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sunday show and the new skunk tester
are what I would recommend to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: osamine and get you as close to that fire
OG as you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember my dude, John, make sure you
check your inbox, check that spam folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you've got a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we burned through two messages
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people have gotten seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've answered a couple of good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this rapid fire pace going and
see how long I can keep this shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from special KL,
special kill, special KL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special K how about we're going to call
you special K now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your new motherfucking name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling already fucking this all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says when getting started breeding,
when do you use open pollination versus
[SPEAKER_00]: selected individuals?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quickly have to talk about the
difference between open pollination and
[SPEAKER_00]: selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when I have multiple males and
females and I let them all just have a big
[SPEAKER_00]: orgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pollen from plant A, B,
and C is going to hit female plants one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, and three in every combination
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen from plant A went to one,
two, and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen from plant B also hit those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get every combination in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're going to find all of the
different phenotypes that are possible in
[SPEAKER_00]: those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find all the different
combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may come up in that gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a very viable and useful way to
increase your inventory of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great reason for open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to make a diverse
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your population is going to be very
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a bunch of different
traits, a whole bunch of different growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, different alleles, if you will,
are going to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to increase, uh,
traits and inventory and see what that
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny has to offer, open pollination is
the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, individual selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you are dialing in traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when I want to isolate or
highlight traits or even breed out
[SPEAKER_00]: specific traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to open up the gene pool
and open up the breeding, do that open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do selection and select for
certain things, that's when the selective
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I answered that one super
quickly and just used a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking weird logic on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered that one sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, special K, check that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you've got a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds at irie direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like burning through these messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throwing paper in the burnt pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one came from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call Joey D.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Joey D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Joey Diaz, but it is damn close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, yo Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've learned so much about everything
that has to do with cannabis plus some
[SPEAKER_00]: life lessons, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great fucking way to open a
message to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been growing three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my hands into a little bit of pollen
chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after three years, you're into a little
bit of pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have a blueberry spice cross I
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fucking delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a hint of blueberry,
but more spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think I can cross it to another
blueberry strain to add more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do I keep hunting through the original
cross for a more blueberry ish plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep hunting through the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of seeds, find that
plant that tastes just like blueberries
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make F twos with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want to do or breed
that, reverse it and breed that one to the
[SPEAKER_00]: good phenotype that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could back cross a phenotype to the
original blueberry parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that original blueberry,
I don't know if you have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which parents you've got,
or you definitely could find if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to add blueberry to it, the easy way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just be finding something with super
blueberry turps and breed it to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want blueberry, the answer is breed
it to the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would back cross it to the original
blueberry parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that, just try to,
that way you're keeping, you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: working with your original genetics,
kind of keeping it in house, doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and keep that project alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to not fix it, but update or polish
the project you've already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to put that blueberry flavor into
there with what you've already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if you can get it in there by
using blueberry that you've already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say back cross it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can back cross it to the original
blueberry, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which was the male,
which was the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got minimal info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the option is, like you said,
go find another super blueberry turp
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just focused on that blueberry turp
and breed it to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get what you want out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a super quick answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Joey D, once again, my bro,
check your inbox for a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I read the next message,
I do need to remind you that those coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: codes do expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those gift certificates do expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come with a clearly labeled
expumeration date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I said expumeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having fun today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That expiration date is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taunting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's going to expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to make them expire because for
logistical bookkeeping reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have free money floating around
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you don't use that coupon
code, it tells me you didn't even listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the episode where I read your question
and they're supposed to be listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm just spitting these
answers out as quickly as I can off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of my head with very little review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I'm nailing these and giving you
guys good, quick answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't need to ramble so much,
which is what I've started doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my buddy Dave in
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my Canadian friends out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I can't send you seeds anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Canada does not like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this message says, Rasta Jeff,
it's Dave from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Dave, out there in Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: Says I'm submitting another excellent
question for your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes, Ron, I'm sorry I can't send you
the seeds, but I do send you a high five
[SPEAKER_00]: and a big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I asked this in the Breeders Chat
on Discord if you want to pop in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: chat about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, and this is a very
good question, do you find that the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor of a feminized line will more often
than not be the dominant phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a feminized line,
the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I find that the pollen donor will be
the dominant phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not regularly, not always, not commonly,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason for that we're going to
talk about in the next line of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, most often, no, that's the bottom
line on that, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says like out of 100 seeds,
50 or more will be leaning to the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor or dead ringers of the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that your pollen donor
is more dominant in the breeding mix than
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen receivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when I talked about the Brock
Lesnar theory?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Brock Lesnar theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: In practice, showing itself right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a Brock Lesnar pollen donor and
those genes are just dominating the mix
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything that you make looks like
poor Brock Lesnar's daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Brock Lesnar theory in action
here in practice, showing itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard that, listen back a
few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember which one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I labeled something the Brock Lesnar
theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go listen to that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody cut a clip out of it for me and
send me a short, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you a fucking gift card.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get so many of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, the best one is going to
get a gift card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that leads me to believe
that your pollen donor has just got
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant genes and dominant traits in all
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, do you find that regular
seeds perform differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without reading the rest of the question,
I'm going to say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it says, in that with regular
seeds, more than 50, 50 phenos are likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a phenotype is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only thing I'm really going
to concede to that I will say is different
[SPEAKER_00]: with femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of phenotypical expression is a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read more of what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: More 50, 50 phenos are likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dominant pheno could be either
male or the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dominant one, like I said,
that's going to be Brock Lesnar theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a really dominant male or
dominant female breeding partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will pop up, that dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those traits will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find regular seeds perform
differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: In that with regular seeds, more than 50,
more 50, 50 phenos are likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dominant pheno could be either
male or female, more phenotype variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I may agree to is that I do
see less variation in the feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's mainly with the selfing of
feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took a Golden Goat S1, I'm not adding
any other genetics to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I'm going to see less variation in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is kind of the only way that I
think I agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really think is happening is what I
have identified as the Brock Lesnar
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your plants is just simply
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a big blonde haired blue eyed
dude, and you're breeding it to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ladies with different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your babies are coming out blonde
hair, blue eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the genetics of that fucking
caveman neanderthal genes you're breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think let me read this one more quick
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're and you even set it in here
where the dominant pheno could be either
[SPEAKER_00]: male or or the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's um, yeah, that's all about
the gene combos and which plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I answered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I may have confused myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I may have confused you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I got it covered there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to take a quick
pause, take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to continue with
these rapid fire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am live aided.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have taken a quick dab while we had
the camera paused.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will never know what could have
happened while I was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me remind you once again, check out
the restock at I read direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've replenished many of the sold out
items that I read direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out before they sell out
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people complain that things sell
out quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is shit restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into this rapid fire
episode of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having fun with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to bang out two more quick
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this question came from that
grow help tab on i read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from my new friend Smitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smitty said, Hey, I love the podcast and
all of the good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have two two by four tents,
both with living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my last row had an issue with spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, fuck spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate spider mites, but we can destroy
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was able to keep them under
control and finish both rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I cleaned the tents as thoroughly as
I thought was needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But always the good but when it comes to
spider mites this round, the mites have
[SPEAKER_00]: come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, what can I do to
completely clean my tents between rounds
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure the mites are wiped out without
leaving strange chemicals in my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: My tents are staggered by about four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spaced about 15 feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I'd be safe sanitizing
each tent individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me for burping at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I took a big fat drink right
before I recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says or if I should let both tents
finish and clean them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing the Golden Girls pack along
with candylicious in the coming rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of your help is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, I think I have got what may be a
very viable solution for a person in your
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not have to shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to worry about any weird
chemicals, which could get me going on
[SPEAKER_00]: another complete fucking side rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would recommend are predator
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would release a bunch of predator bugs,
specific predators in both grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially running perpetual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're kind of running
perpetual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got two tents and they're staggered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're four weeks apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you release bugs in both tents,
they will stay there and they will stay as
[SPEAKER_00]: protective security guards forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may have to replenish lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have them delivered on a schedule
if you even want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may have to lightly replenish
these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get a good population of
predator bugs colonized in these grow
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces, you will never have to spray
anything and you'll barely ever have to
[SPEAKER_00]: replenish these predators if it is done
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would recommend and this is just
a list of predator bugs that you can order
[SPEAKER_00]: from many different vendors and
distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to recommend Arbico organics dot
com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's A R B I C O dash organics dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm simply a satisfied customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have several friends who have shopped
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of other companies and
what are they called insectiaries that may
[SPEAKER_00]: be closer to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can recommend that I can recommend
Arbico.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done great work for me before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bugs I would recommend are
Swarovski's, Persimilis, Californicus,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypoaspis Miles, and Green Lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another one, Cucumeris is what
I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have been the name of another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have swapped a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cucumeris is one that I forgot to
write down that I'll add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got the Swarovski, Persimilis,
Californicus, Hypoaspis Miles,
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Lacewings, and Cucumeris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would release as many of them as you can
afford into that grow space and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: decimate your spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will destroy the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Release it into both spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can release that in your flower room
without any harm, without any problem at
[SPEAKER_00]: any time, any stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be harmless to your flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use these at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them on your seedlings all the
way up to your flowering plants and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will eat up all of the bugs for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll start looking for other
bugs and they'll go further and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for other bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there aren't any they'll leave and
then they'll die and then you'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: replenish them so that you don't get more
spider mites in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easily, it's very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't want to spray shit,
if you don't want weird chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which triggers me in its own way,
we'll talk about that later in a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Predator bugs are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit expensive,
but if you think about it, they're cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective compared to a bottled pesticide
rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want two or three different bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to apply those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the bugs will be more effective
and cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to say, don't use
ladybugs because them bitches are fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to read one more
message in this rapid fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I want from you guys,
please, if you would, was leave me some
[SPEAKER_00]: comments in the comments section and let
me know what you thought of this rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: fire show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer the long drawn out answers
when I ramble my face off and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated too much info?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you like it when I bang through a
whole bunch of questions and give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of info really quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Argue about it down there in the comments
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question came from somebody
called my plants talk back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's plants talk back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to be listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question says, I'm getting ready to
start my first breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I don't want my whole crop to be
seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a struggle,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but I want a good amount of seeds
to play with and hunt through.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, how many plants should I
pollinate from a reversed female to give
[SPEAKER_00]: me a healthy yield of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, any tips on reversing females would
be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full podcast on reversing
plants, so if you can find that full
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, we don't have to ramble about it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could stay rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've purchased the chemicals needed to
make STS and I have a recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any additives?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't add anything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it just like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the silver nitrate, sodium
thiosulfate, distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend collecting the pollen by
hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, smack that reverse plant right up
against your pollen receiver plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give them a good smack, a good tap if
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I would recommend to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long can I store the pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: No more than a couple of months if you
insist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I recommend you put the reverse plant
in the tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it right next to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it pollen it and then shake it and
then rub it up against the girls when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would love to try some of your beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my friend, I apologize for rubbing
my eye here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got something in the eyeball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was my own dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, you do get to try my seeds
because you get a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question here was, I want a good
amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, how many plants should I
pollinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, you can make a lot
of seeds from very small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing a brand new breeding
project, if I just want to try something
[SPEAKER_00]: out and make some seeds for myself that
you don't get, I will pollinate plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, beer cups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take a male clone and a female
clone and a beer cup and I'll take several
[SPEAKER_00]: of those clones of the females and I'll
put them in a little tiny room and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate them in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hit five or six, seven or eight beer
cups with one beer cup male, put them
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the middle, hit all those girls,
and I can produce 30 to 50, maybe 70 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: of each one of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's plenty for me to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small beer cup, a one gallon pot is a
plenty big enough size plant to make
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of seeds for you to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer cups are easy to manage if you
understand how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to veg them very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg it till it's about three and a half,
four and a half inches tall, then flip it,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them do their magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make plenty of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gallon pots will make hundreds of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could produce plenty of seeds to play
with in just a small pot in a small amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of time is what I think I'm trying to get
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ramble on a lot more,
but yeah, just one plant will get you
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend pollinating several different
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can see the representation of
that male amongst multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses and see what he is contributing to
the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll give you more insight to what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rambled about this a lot in other
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the time or place for me to
get rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
all of you rapid fire podcast listeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your feedback on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you thought of this rapid
fire show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to bang out as much info as I
could in as short a time as I could get
[SPEAKER_00]: through some of these emails, get you guys
some prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that got their message read does
get a free pack of seeds, so make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: check your spam, check your inbox,
get those coupon codes, get those beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of all, I look forward to your
comments in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll do more quickies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll do more at the regular pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll mix and match.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my party and I'll dab if I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it's time for me to wrap up
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hanging out.
