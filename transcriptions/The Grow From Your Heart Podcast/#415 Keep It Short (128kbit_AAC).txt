[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 415 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to add fresh genetics to your
garden, and I highly recommend Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Elite Seeds, and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Oregon Elite Seeds
on 420, because we are dropping the brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new Blue Raspberry Truffle from Irie
Genetics on 420 at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still taking dabs of this Lemon G
Batter from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it has 68.5% THC with 79.1%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this concentrate smells deliciously
disgusting and I can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a tremendous head buzz and it
is great podcasting concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to read a
couple of listener emails and answer a few
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, but before we get there,
I want to do a couple of shoutouts for my
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shoutout to my friend
Brett Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge shoutout to my friend Keith
Klump.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shoutout to Matthew Kate
Wellman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shoutout to Riley Hansen,
and always a big shoutout to my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody for all of the
Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to become a
patron, all you need to do is go to
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to become
a patron will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I said I had a few emails to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first email comes to us from our
friend Glenn G in Oklahoma, and the email
[SPEAKER_00]: goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep this short and to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a longtime pro cannabis activist who
lives in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven years ago, my son was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the age of four, he was diagnosed with
severe autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years ago, my wife and I finally got
frustrated enough with bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw no improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that changed were his
meltdowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got way fucking worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pharmaceuticals weren't helping at
all, it appears.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were making your child worse,
which is totally not desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kicked those lame fuckers to the
curb and did our own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would make multiple trips each year to
Colorado to pick up cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently we have started growing for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very proud of you for taking on the
task of growing the cannabis for your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you for that and I'm glad to
be able to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am a tremendously passionate
person in all that I do, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: growing my son's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your show, your perspective and your
attitude along with the content you
[SPEAKER_00]: provide are priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between you, the DGC and Mr. Canucks grow
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the fuck else is going
on in the world outside my family,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really mind at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We I speak for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are glad to be there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an honor to know that we are
providing you with the knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: the information and the skills to be able
to grow quality medicine for your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that that means a lot to the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that means a lot to Mr.
Canuck that we are helping your child
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy life a little better, which is
making the entire family enjoy life a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is our pleasure and it is an honor
to be able to help you in any way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here talking into a microphone,
sharing the things that I have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually taking that knowledge and
that information and you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big kudos to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect to you for actually having the
heart to get up and figure out what it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to help your son and then put it
together and make it happen for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is commendable and respectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you the knowledge and you are
using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is working beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue on with the message because
there is a lot more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my son's learning and development
has been growing in leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously not dabbing with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought him an infuser and we make our
own tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things combined have got me feeling
iry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be picking up some of your
genetics as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my name Glenn G in
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the big part to take away from that
is he said in the past they had enough
[SPEAKER_00]: with bullshit pharmaceuticals,
no improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only made his son's meltdowns worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he is using cannabis and he is
improving in leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the part to notice in this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glenn, I am proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can do anything for your family,
for your son, you let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say here that you would like to get
some iry genetics as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get you set up with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me what kind of medicine works
best for your son and I will see what in
[SPEAKER_00]: the iry genetics lineup will fit that
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get you some seeds for your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get your son very well taken care
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be my pleasure and it would be an
honor to have my plant in the garden that
[SPEAKER_00]: is helping out your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Glenn in Oklahoma, big thank you for
this great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we get questions and
people need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to have somebody reach out and
say that my advice and my guidance has
[SPEAKER_00]: improved the quality of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple people are enjoying their lives
because of the guidance I have given you
[SPEAKER_00]: and it means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for this great message and I
look forward to hearing from you so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get you some new beans in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next email comes from, let's see,
do they say their name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want us to say their name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call them Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, first off,
I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on my third grow and I've been
listening to your podcast since before the
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quickly working my way back through
all the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to up it to three episodes
a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this week you may get spoiled,
but I cannot promise that every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, dude, thanks for listening to
all the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying it's a little bit
embarrassing when people go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I love that you're listening to
the old content and catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am much more comfortable on
a microphone and a much better podcaster
[SPEAKER_00]: at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, I had to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you've been listening
for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the message
because that lemon G makes me ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyways, I think my question is
probably one that no one bothers to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I keep plants small?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, let me explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is starting his first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He read something online about putting
seeds in a cup of water overnight to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they were viable, if the seed floated
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if there's any truth to that,
but all 20 of his feminine seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super quickly in over his head with
seedlings, so he gave me half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them in beer cups and then repotted
them into six inch pots, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: outgrowing those quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they will grow quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that seed thing before we
get too far here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floaters and the sinkers, I have found
that good seeds will float and good seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: will sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't find that to be true in my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had seeds that float germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had seeds that sink germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not a good judge of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 20 of them germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on purchasing good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you got those, that breeder did a
good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 20 seeds to crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're in quickly over your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you guys, when you were planting
seeds, you have to plan on them cracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got success and it fucked you all
up because you didn't plan properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly in over your head is a common
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got half of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went into six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great, but they are outgrowing
those quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if you've got them under enough light
or maybe not even enough light,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will still outgrow those six inch net
pots quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, I want to have an outdoor garden
this year, so I'm hoping to keep these
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and healthy, yet small enough to
handle and keep in my two by four grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tents until outdoor season in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got all of April and we're
working our way into May.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a real struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, I'm worried about letting them
get root bound and choking themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: about them getting too leggy instead of
bushy as they crowd each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is what is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them in those small six inch
net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't get root bound in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The net pots allow a lot of air,
but they won't be able to develop a real
[SPEAKER_00]: large root ball like they want to support
a big fat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is going to cause you a little bit
of slowed growth, especially when you take
[SPEAKER_00]: them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be in bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the first things I'm going
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to go into bigger pots because
what is going to happen is not only are
[SPEAKER_00]: they going to choke themselves,
they are going to begin to auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start flowering because
they're root bound and they're stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if they were outside and the
roots didn't have anywhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant would say, shit, I'm stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go into my final phase of
life, which is flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will try to flower on you indoors
under plenty of light if you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: them into bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first thing to be concerned
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing you said about them getting
leggy instead of bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely another thing that is
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got too many plants crowded
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you're in a crowded room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't spread out your arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the subway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't enough seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't walk through the subway with
your arms open and don't spread your legs
[SPEAKER_00]: real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not man spreading on the subway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stand tall and keep your arms at your
side because it's too damn crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your plants are going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leggy and root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to try to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping them is probably the only way
you're going to keep these plants short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them as much light as you can
possibly give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too little light will cause them to
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of light will prevent stretch that
will keep them short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to do a lot with the amount
of time you've got, but it will prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: them from stretching too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: More light will prevent stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have found that a short,
dark period, you need them to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will prevent the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to take off and grow
straight up during all that day period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them some sleeping period,
they will bush out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, I've talked about veg
times a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bush out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, think about your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more phosphorus and potassium may
help them bush out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to push the nutrients super
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also may help keep them a little
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to do, honestly,
is get a bigger space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe select your favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, okay, we've got a few options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to spread them out and
give these plants more space, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get tall, skinny, leggy,
stretchy, and ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not really what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to do is up-pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't do that, I would eliminate
some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be the best bet for you
because you've got 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want 10 outside, but you can
either have 10 shitty plants or six really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your option right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do, if you've got
the ability, you can take clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants while they're too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take those stretchy tops and just create
them into clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then throw away the other plants and use
the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are more manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't gotten out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if those clones will be big
enough to go outdoors in the time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some situations, this may work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just coming up with things that could
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to up-pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably be your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then spread them out the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then possibly take some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then possibly eliminate the plants that
you don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have got to be a few in there that
you look at them and you go, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, if you've got too
many plants, if you are above your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count, if you were stressed about it,
now is the time to knock out a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: those ugly plants and just say goodbye to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying goodbye to a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are looking forward to a better grow
and you're getting rid of the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it that way if that is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, any tips on keeping them from
growing too quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarter strength nudes, 14 hour lights on
cycle, cooler temps, weaker lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if a 60 degree basement with
one or two T5s may keep them small,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time, I don't want them
stretching for the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they will stretch for the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them under T5s, they are going
to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want as much light as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: More light will keep them shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like the right thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow more quickly with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have more general vigor,
but they won't be taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Height isn't always a good indicator of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Height is also stretch and says right
here, stretching for the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to stress them,
you could go super cold or super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 60 degree basement with too much light
may be a good idea at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't generally recommend that,
but you're trying to fuck these plants up
[SPEAKER_00]: and slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go too cold and give them too much
light or go too hot and give them too much
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and that will stunt them and slow
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a product out there called
Bushmaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't recommend specific
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: A product called Bushmaster will make
these plants stay short and squat and make
[SPEAKER_00]: them bush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can add some Bushmaster to your
feeding regimen, that should help you out
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also continue Bushmaster through
the early parts of flower and it will keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants nice and short and prevent
that early flower stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mainly you need to up pop these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to auto flower on you if
you do not up pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter when you put them outdoors,
they'll start flowering on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants also need a little bit of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pull them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're not touching each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are touching each other,
it may be a good idea to get rid of a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, you can have 10
shitty plants or you can have six really
[SPEAKER_00]: stellar plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a decision you need to make at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut clones off of each one and
then you can just label it number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant number one clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone number one, plant number two,
clone number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see roots out of clone
number two, you can throw away plant
[SPEAKER_00]: number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you've got a backup copy and that
can be the one that you nurture up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right size and you put it out to flower in
May in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the middle of April right now,
so you've got two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You barely have time to get a clone
rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be a reasonable solution in
your situation, but in some cases that may
[SPEAKER_00]: be what some people have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are too tall, just cut a
clone from it and start fresh with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody gives me a big plant,
if you give me a plant like a one or a
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallon pot, I usually generally
don't take that home and flower that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clone it and make a couple of clones and
throw the big plant away because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start fresh with the tiny plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to cause my own problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to work with a plant that's
already stretched out and fucked up and
[SPEAKER_00]: has a bunch of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a littler plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can treat it with pesticides better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can treat it with foliar sprays
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can nurse it back to health much more
easily if you've got that little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be an option for some folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you're a little behind the
deadline for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is not going to work is putting them
under weaker light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weaker light is going to cause them to
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to have the exact opposite
effect of what you're expecting,
[SPEAKER_00]: so do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I hope I have given you enough info,
guidance, and advice to help you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants a little bit short and a
little bit squatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear how you handle this,
and I cannot wait to see pictures of your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor crop from Massachusetts at the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up this email, and he says,
thanks for any advice and keep up the
[SPEAKER_00]: great work from Andrew, and he says,
PS, I cannot wait for Lemon Jeffrey to be
[SPEAKER_00]: back in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning on a batch of Arise and Lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got good news for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have Lemon Jeffrey seeds
available by 7 Tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to find them at
OregonEliteSeeds.com, so stay tuned and
[SPEAKER_00]: check back often.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Andrew once again for a
great email and a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions that you would
like read on the show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving along with the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next email goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really informative and entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment because that
tells me I am hitting my exact goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, I appreciate
you sharing your knowledge, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me improve my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share something I started
doing that may help others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting seedlings and clones in a solo
cup is recommended in many places,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have started a modification on this
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then part of the email is cut off
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what happened when I printed
it, but part of it got cut off and it
[SPEAKER_00]: says, I really wanted to see how the roots
take hold in the soil is what it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like it should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the message describes how this guy
pots his clones and seedlings into a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: beer cup filled with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he takes the clear beer cup and
slides it inside a regular beer cup so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the roots are shaded for the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of this message is cut off,
but I understand why this guy is doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have done this to show new people in
gardens how to look at the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's a watch for and how to know when to
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this guy is doing with part of his
email missing here, I'll explain what he's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is taking a seedling or a clone and he
is potting it in a beer cup filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but he is using a clear cup so that
as the roots develop, he can watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots grow and take over that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great way to teach people about
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great way to teach people about
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to learn about soil and
roots and about how the plant grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: about the direction that the roots take
over the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a really good practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is that the roots are very
sensitive to light and we are putting
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants under ridiculously bright
lights all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is counterproductive to have a clear
container for our roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to grow fat roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light hits them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start getting beat down by the light
and they start deteriorating and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: broken down and they start receding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy has gotten the idea of
planting his clone into a clear cup and
[SPEAKER_00]: then gently setting that clear cup into a
colored cup so that the roots are not
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to the harmful light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be sure to poke holes in the bottom
of each cup so that we have plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want water getting built up in
that cup and then we are going to drown
[SPEAKER_00]: those precious roots that we are trying to
watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing this, we can watch the
development of our roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing this, we can see exactly when
that container is filled with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see when those roots are wrapping
around that container, around that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: medium and it's overtaking that container
and we know exactly the best time to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really good idea and I think
that a lot of new growers could probably
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a lot by doing this and it is
probably just fun to share if you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grower, if you are a trainer,
if you are an educator, this is a good way
[SPEAKER_00]: to show people about roots and root
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a big shout out to my
friend who sent me this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, in the spirit of your podcast,
I wanted to give back some knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: share something that's really been working
well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for what you do, Jeff,
and keep the faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signed it G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friend G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure somebody will use that and I'm
sure they will enjoy watching the little
[SPEAKER_00]: ant farm that is their root zone develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, PS, I'm waiting for the
return of lemon Jeffrey too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the ETA on the last show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks seem clairvoyant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think it was
clairvoyancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was an influx of emails
requesting the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what got it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I can't wait to get some lemon
Jeffrey in your hands and I cannot wait to
[SPEAKER_00]: see pictures of the lemon G in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey G, big thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
