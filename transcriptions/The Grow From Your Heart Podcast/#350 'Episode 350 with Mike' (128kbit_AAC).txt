[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I already hit record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 350 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No intro music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying it messes up my rhythm and
also it messes up YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting myself in trouble using music
that I am allowed to use on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, use this music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get it from a website that they're
all about it, but then YouTube is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't use that music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because somebody else has probably
used that free music in their video
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube's just like, haha, first come
first serve, bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can use one and that one's
already been chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just avoiding the music fiasco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to skip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to get right to podcasting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of music, you get to hear this
to start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode is
brought to you by our friends at the Hella

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for them to reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them a brief moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the computer like,
oh, they're probably going, I'm good,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't interrupt them when they're saying
hi to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just smoking a bowl with you guys,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in my cubicle typing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a little work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking about fucking 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off at four.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just typing Mike in the computer and
then I'll be as high as you sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us for the podcast,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be back, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Mike's wife ever happens to hear this,
thanks for letting him come play and be on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was talking to his wife,
by the way, not me when he said thanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: babe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was totally for the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got awkward quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fucking weird fast in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of awkward and weird,
I want to talk about what I did yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go meet a friend that I have only
known from the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever guys ever meet somebody that
you meet on the internet?
[SPEAKER_00]: You meet them in person, finally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they used to have posters that
said, don't meet people you met on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet?
[SPEAKER_00]: That used to be a thing, but in this day
and age- Just checking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm officially old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're in the old club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the old club, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person passed all the initial tests
and you got to meet an internet friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not Tinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a dating site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually met.
[SPEAKER_00]: She discovered me through granny's
Instagram live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started watching my feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was going to be in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: She messaged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, Hey, I'm going to be in
Colorado Springs or Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to meet you and or dabbing
granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I bet I could make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm pretty sure I can make it
because I'm not inviting everybody on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet to try to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes wishes are granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this just the timing worked out so
perfectly because granny and I were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about getting together anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is like, I wish I can get with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, watch, we'll make magic
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I arranged for dabbing granny and my
self and our lovely friend, Miss Melville
[SPEAKER_00]: and Melville brought along her lovely mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all met up together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if I want to reveal the
place where we met because now people have
[SPEAKER_01]: been met at a secret location.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went and we, uh, it was a safe cannabis
friendly location in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we met up and I got to give this
lovely young lady her very first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also got to give Mel her very first
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, I pulled that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to call Mel's mom, a very lovely
young lady right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's smooth talking for the ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two lovely young ladies,
I got to give them both their first dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both took a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think actually granny gave her mom
her first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She held the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got to hit a Darby rig, a,
uh, a quite pricey, pretty fancy Darby
[SPEAKER_00]: home custom rig made for dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lady got to pull her first dab off of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Mel got to hit the hitman rig for her
first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got to hit the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I dropped the dab in for, she is
dabbing at the same time as granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So her first dab was a dab video with dad
and granny lady got nice and spoiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to dive right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been telling this person that,
uh, when she gets to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get her uncomfortably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking mission accomplished, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it on her face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, we don't have to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go eat or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, are you good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, I have to leave here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, but you gotta stay here
if you're that uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, Nope, I'm leaving here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, motion and then interaction will
not improve your comfortability level.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made her hang out for quite a while
before I'd let her drive away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want snacks and rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her mom on the other hand, handled her
dad's like a fucking champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, her mom was taking those dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, can I get another dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, you're, you look
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I looked at her and I was like,
yeah, you're, you're fucking bright item,
[SPEAKER_00]: bushy tailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you another dab lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friend Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to finally meet you in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've been friends on the Instagram
live for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She comes in my Instagram live feed and
hangs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she goes and granny's Instagram live
feed and hangs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to granny's live feed also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all just friends in all these
different live feeds, but it was fun to
[SPEAKER_00]: finally meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, got a big hug, got to take some dabs,
got to meet your mom, got to introduce you
[SPEAKER_00]: to dab and granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Mel shout out to her
mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say her mom's name was Debbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really bad with names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to the lovely dab and
granny dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab and granny gave me a dab mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the little dab and granny power
puff girl looking, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animated character looking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of don't want to use it as a dab
mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to find a way to affix that to my
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool fridge magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, shout out to those lovely ladies
for hanging out with me and sharing some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab and granny load me, loaded me up with
great gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I got this cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to talk about these for a
second, just cause I think these are
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that comes to my mind
as a boy, I'm a grown ass man now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this reminds me of a movie from my
boyhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the movie when the dude walked in
and tried to steal a samurai sword?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little samurai sword holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've been a Steven Seagal movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember a little boy stealing
one, but yeah, if you're going to display
[SPEAKER_01]: samurai swords, this is the little stand
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just miniature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would basically be, it's a sword
display stand, but it's a tiny version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if you had, or maybe baseball
bats or billiards cues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you put billiards cues in
there cause they'd bow probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, you don't want, you don't want
to cues laying like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe baseball bats, but anyway,
this one is tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably two and a half inches wide,
and then it's got three tiers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically a shelf for your
dabbers so that you don't have to set your
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky dabber on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 3D printed in a 3D printer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a sweet baby blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the Dab and Granny logo right in
the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the bottom, it looks like it's got
the name of the company who printed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says EE710.com printed in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was gifted to me by the beautiful Dab
and Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has already gotten so much use in the
past 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed it right when I walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yay, you don't have to hunt for
the dab tool now in this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little spot and it's not going
to be on the table getting sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, along with that little accessory
pack came a Dab and Granny carb cap
[SPEAKER_00]: holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, I'm going to say it's a golf tee
for your carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the easiest way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your carb cap sits on the, it goes on the
rig and it gets sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you set it down right on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The table gets sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: This basically goes between the two and it
holds the carb cap upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm giving shout outs to people,
I always shout out to Della Luna Glass for
[SPEAKER_00]: my new beautiful dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this color is called Serendipity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a pointy end for shattery dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a scoopy end for the saucy dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to all my friends for all the
great gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to Della Luna Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a good time hanging out with
those ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a hell of a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab and Granny gave me some medicated
syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis syrup and it's 1,000
milligrams in this little bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called nano-infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure how they nano-infuse
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not write that on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to research that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told there are two methods used for
nano-infusing and one is unhealthy and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other is healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it once and I got lit as shit off
that 1,000 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says to drink a capful and I drank a
lot full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably drank three ounces of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately as the drink went into my
body, I could feel it hit my stomach and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I could feel it spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, it didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going and now it's going down my arms
and there it goes through my fingertips
[SPEAKER_00]: and there it goes to my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just feel myself get slow motion
and melt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like a piece of wax next to a flame.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's specifically why I don't play with
tinctures anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a picture of the bottle to
Instagram and I've seen Mama Bear Dab's
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen her sip it quite frequently on
her live feed, but she takes little sips
[SPEAKER_00]: like little hobo sips and granny does the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When granny gave me this, I was like,
man, she's like, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, go lightly and I was like,
or and she's like, oh my God, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, we're just gonna fucking
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uber's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a picture of it and everybody
that has experienced it posted sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: dreams or a nighty night or sweet dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Lucy right away was like,
good night.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend was her comment immediately and
I see her sip it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she knew what was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that stuff got me lit, but I survived
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have to take an extra nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed up actually as late as I needed
to be up at a normal night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, uh, that syrup was, it was
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely, if you're not a dabber,
if you're not a heavy consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have a high saturation of THC
in your body, if you're a low consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't buy nothing that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even, I don't think it's a
Colorado available product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any of the Colorado
compliant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny's been flying around to all the
events and festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have come from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have come from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could have been from anywhere,
but she gets a lot of gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody actually stole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much of this I should
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Devin, granny carries a lot of
concentrates on her and in Seattle,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody stole her bag of concentrates
while she was on stage doing an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she said so, Seattle made up for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some Seattle was like,
Oh yeah, somebody stole from you in our
[SPEAKER_00]: town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave her, yeah, every vendor in
Seattle hooked her up some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so hard that some of it landed on my
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dab it because she was
like, I need somebody to smoke this for me
[SPEAKER_00]: because they gave me way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all the people in Seattle
that took good care of Devin, granny,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a big middle finger that stole
something from Devin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to steal from a sweet
ass old lady?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You steal them from a granny, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: My granny, even I'll whip your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go play in traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people ready to, ready to stand up
her, but it's been fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma sorted it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny got plenty of gifts in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that person probably burned themselves
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's episode 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we should be doing some sort
of celebratory stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do what I normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally tell people what we're smoking
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking on all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've smoked a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's been here for a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: The occasional coughs, folks, the dabs
before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, uh, that season it's,
uh, right at this season in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sick right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, stay the fuck away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get a chest thing at this season,
a nose and chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel sick, but I will,
my lungs will change at this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what I'm talking about you guys,
it just went from 102 degrees every day to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 degrees just over fucking night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's snowing like an hour and 20 from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shut up with the S word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, basically you're driving straight
up, but about an hour and 20 from here,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was fucking snowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to destroy the
highway right before all that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have fun here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to what we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's fucking working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've been smoking on the coffee
nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the coffee nectar
several times on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's coughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took off his headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if that tells you anything,
uh, talked about the coffee nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dark roast coffee and watermelon
candy flavored, uh, just trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: further from the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I really like this gunslinger nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is star fighter and star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's described as watermelon, gummy slices
and fresh white ripe watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've described it as, uh, those
candies that old people have in a candy
[SPEAKER_00]: dish on the table that are wrapped in a
strawberry looking wrapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this tastes just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dab it, if you want to dab it,
I go for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, imagine taking a sip of coffee
while you're at a small space with
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody over vaping something watermelon
flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you, you right off the bat,
you get a nice light coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coffee flavor, but almost immediately that
dissolves and it's a light watermelon
[SPEAKER_01]: candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like being in the car with Brian a
little bit coffee and watermelon vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Brian?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be listening to this one day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then Mike was kind enough to bring
over some New York city diesel batter from
[SPEAKER_00]: apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the texture on that is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the texture and that flavor it
left, uh, I don't know what turp that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that, uh, I've been in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that has seen me smoking the New
York city diesel live on the Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, dude, that one really gets
you because it just gets me talking and it
[SPEAKER_00]: like puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I brought that flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm exhausted today and that one really
perks me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got those, uh, Mike's got those new
baby eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long night with a very small
child last night, but, uh, this New York
[SPEAKER_01]: city diesel has got me on my feet and hell
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 350.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I haven't missed a Monday and close to
five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've done my math, consistent is one
time I got to give you a shout out because
[SPEAKER_00]: one time I was actually sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably this time of the year and
I sent you and a couple other guys a text
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, boys, I'm Adam and now Jesse,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys came over and maybe Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a bunch of us around the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were like, I'm sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna hit record and like,
here's some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys got stoned as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned these knobs over here that make
the podcast happen and hit record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, guys, I'm sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you guys talked and I was like,
thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my book, that's a fucking podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, I think it's been close to
five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did my math correctly, every time you
and I try to figure out how long it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're recording the show,
it gets ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to try right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's somebody out there will let us
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then if I time it right,
bro, I don't want to make any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to record a couple of bonus
episodes and put them out like ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a Monday and Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I throw out a Friday show here and
there, we can get episode four 20 on four
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying cause we can try to make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try it, but that's, that's so
that's, I got to get out of college.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I need seven extra coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a bigger bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I forgot what the fuck I was going
to say anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, episode four 20 and then we'll
maybe we'll do that episode about four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do episode four 20 about content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mike just smacked his head directly to
the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this show is for people who are
curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suppose it would be an inappropriate
topic, but man, I've read that fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: shit post so many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: The origin of four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll talk about what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means to us and how we got introduced
to it or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be episode four 20 on four 20
center was back in like 99, 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not blow the whole episode,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 70 episodes to go 70 to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sure do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to be a rambly episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys hadn't picked up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time Mike is here, Mike is a fucking
train wreck of a podcast and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for not saying train wreck of a
human.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got most, most of your life,
most of your life that you reveal seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people about looks on the up and up
and the shit you you're hiding them
[SPEAKER_01]: skeletons, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to bear the skeletons deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how people don't find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike seems to be pro citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to like I said, a fucking
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find some rails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of iTunes comments I
want to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since it's episode three 50,
I feel like it's appropriate to read
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why that felt like
appropriate, but it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got three new comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them just we'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we finally got a negative comment,
you guys, which fucking I've expected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool because when you get a
negative comment on iTunes, it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: puts you in the algorithm for your
comments to be seen by other viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll put you up in the advertising and
stuff and it'll ask more people to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews because now it believes that not
all of my five star reviews are Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: trolls or some sort of bots or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, look, somebody actually did
90 cousins to each submit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just went and made 150 email accounts
and made reviews under all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they believe it because somebody
gave a bad review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I was trolling myself, I wouldn't
put a bad review in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen it pop up in more places,
which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the first two positive
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on August 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person I'm trying to read their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I just hit the wrong button on the
iPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their name is OHSIN666.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's Ohio sin 666.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done with wherever you're from and
whoever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review because it
goes like this great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hooked ever since and I listen
to it daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot and I've been reminded
of a lot of stuff I had forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great because I like to go back and
remind you of the stuff that we forget
[SPEAKER_00]: because we get so advanced that you forget
you become a black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You forget that white belt kata.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go back and leg kick you one time
and you remember shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They throw low leg kicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to go back and remind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I won't stop listening till I've
heard them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them coming, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, dude, thanks for the great five star
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time a review on my show has the word
Joe Rogan in it, it makes me fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't say I sound like Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am as good as Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just put the words Joe Rogan in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Referencing in the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five stars for you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way to put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for real, man, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening and you'll never hear them
all because there will always be more
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm counting down to the negative review,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see him drum rolling on the table
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says best podcast on MMJ,
which is medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you're looking for something
that's not about marijuana, this shows not
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for like boats,
cars, trains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this one is not going to be the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're curious about cannabis,
this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rant was brought to you by a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one was left on August 29th by a
person that calls themselves the authority
[SPEAKER_00]: in all tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to need to succeed some
credentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just want to hang out because I've
got some fucking issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually a website issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a stitcher problem that we're
going to address here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you send commenters questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, authority in all tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like tech law enforcement?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the guru?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he left a great review,
so I'm going to quit picking on him or
[SPEAKER_00]: she.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be fair these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person left a review and it says very
knowledgeable and easy to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something for everyone from
novice to master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think you know all that you need
to know, but Rasta Jeff will occasionally
[SPEAKER_00]: bring up insights you may have forgotten
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a theme here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are noticing that I'm going back
and kind of reteaching the basics again
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like a lot of people are
too worried about turps, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's squish it and get turps,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't even learned how to fucking
grow good weed yet.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working on I have got and I
could pull it up on the iPad here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show Mike what I've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice series of episodes
written.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start coming out very
shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a website issue that needs to be
corrected as soon as that is fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep making excuses, but the
website fucking fucked up yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that's back up, my next goal is
to start working on producing all these
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes in a row about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with like planning your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to start with the
grow series that you're putting together
[SPEAKER_01]: is intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to hear a lot of me
rambling during that series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be here for a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just be head down into my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take some dabs that I'll leave and
he'll record.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that you guys have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of went back into the drying and
curing again because I'm trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the basics while also teaching the
advanced techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also did carbohydrates and enzymes,
you know, which are a little more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the redo of some of those old
episodes was like specifically with drying
[SPEAKER_01]: and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned more about environments that
aren't ours since that first killer dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably been through three large
scale grows in a hundred meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium scale grows and 20,000 small grows
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exaggerating with 20,000, but yeah,
I've been to a lot of grows, big and
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that first strike here was like what
episode 36.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told so many people to go find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 36 or 72 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're at three 50 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not afraid to go back and say,
Hey, I was doing it wrong back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing it right back in the day and
we've learned 10 important things sense
[SPEAKER_01]: and now doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Means how many times have I flopped in and
out of do and don't foliar feed your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm all about doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let's foliar feed the plants,
put some push on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, authority in all tech,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for or not, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this is a male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to stop, uh, addressing people as
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to quit assuming it's 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sorry to put that on you there like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're probably a fucking great
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to put the gender joke on in
your comment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but dude, thanks for the great
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for thinking I'm the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find no competition, but for people to
think I'm the best means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the review and I thank you
for the listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, uh, this one was left on August
30th by another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they call themselves Yolo grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Yolo grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they left a two star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're disappointed in us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's worse than them being mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ain't my daddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike said, read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, he's giving me, I'm checking
one of the facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just do a Zorro snap in a Z
formation?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a one handed air quote that is
sleep deprived.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this review says disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get serious and we're going
to read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says used to be my favorite podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started listening, I listened to
the old episode since I didn't discover
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast until almost episode 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great information in some episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you found some information
and some, some of them were just having
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they can't all be fucking gold bro or
sis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then the episode can, or the review
continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says lately Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has been making inappropriate
comments with his female guests and
[SPEAKER_00]: insulting Velcro shoe wearing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only female guest I can recall having
in a long time is granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just scrolled back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Stitch has been messing with me a
lot, so I didn't really want to reference
[SPEAKER_01]: the platform, but we're going to go back
to episode 300 and I'm 99% sure there's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a female guest from 300 and now that's
not the wonderful Ms. Dab and granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if there were any inappropriate
comments made while granny was on,
[SPEAKER_01]: granny was probably making them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was probably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't even need to defend any
inappropriate comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have been made when granny was on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really weird criticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like making fun of my dreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like go ahead, not yourself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like making fun of my dreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how can you be inappropriate with
female guests?
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if I don't have to criticize him for
not having enough female guests,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're talking about the Instagram
live feeds that just dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is even relative to
the podcast, but we'll leave this in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're talking about the Instagram
live feeds on Instagram live feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do, uh, we do joke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, uh, since some of my friends,
my personal friends are in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that do press the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there is some shenanigans in there
that people wouldn't approve of,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is not on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was on a specific separate platform,
the commenter would have referenced the
[SPEAKER_01]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we read further into the comment,
we'll realize that that may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something in here that makes me
think that what you just said may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I don't recall inappropriate on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologize if I hurt your little feelers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if it was with granny,
that's all in fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I said anything
inappropriate with a female guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Shannon from CGC long times ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really hang off Lindsay anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Shannon hasn't been on a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe it was when Angela was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a hundred episodes ago,
but or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what number that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting way too much fucking thought
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I apologize if somebody had their
little feelers hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, making fun of Velcro shoe wearing
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really thinking that this is somebody
watching the Instagram live feeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are not the podcast, but still,
if you're bothered by something I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's another podcast you can listen
to check out the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably still listening to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to hear this review,
but anyway, inappropriate guests are
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate comments with the guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else complained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only one saying anything about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Velcro shoe part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't recall, but if you want to point it
out, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then he said the podcast is also not
been reliable lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hear half the podcast sometimes,
even though he always talks about how he
[SPEAKER_00]: found the issue and fixed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now see, that's what makes me think that
they're complaining about the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: platform because the issue is on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That issue is definitely a Stitcher issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is most definitely an iTunes
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That issue was happening on Stitcher and
he's saying that he can't listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talking about multiple platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comment is happening here on
iTunes and there's obviously not a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: on iTunes because nobody else on iTunes
has said, Hey, there's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually go back and listen to my
own show on iTunes occasionally just to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can listen to my own show on
Stitcher as well, because the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't happen for me, which is why I
didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens to people with Android devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have no way of knowing if it's
happening or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to call Mike or get a message from
somebody else and they say, Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I notice it, cause I'm an
Android Stitcher user.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I shoot him a text as soon as I notice,
but sometimes that's Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he says, uh, I talked about how I
found the issue and fixed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'm disappointed in you,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, used to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person's disappointed in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but let's address this Stitcher issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with techs from
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Richard and somebody else,
I think are their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm emailing with two guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not calling them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it happened when happened to three
episodes into after having the new Mac
[SPEAKER_00]: book is when the issue started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're wondering if there's something
with the conversion here, but then we
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all of the things that they asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I uploaded a new file.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hit and miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that's happening with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're scrolling through my, they're
listening to my episodes and like looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at my files and shit to see what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither one of us can find an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got the Stitcher team working on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that made Stitcher,
the people that built that machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know why it's fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they can't figure it out,
I know I can't.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not an issue with what you're
uploading because it uploads smooth,
[SPEAKER_01]: smoothly to other platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's every other platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all goes to the same RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I loaded up one time and it goes
to like feed burner, cast box,
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes, Stitcher, wherever else it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the one RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how an RSS feed works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to a place, you register your
RSS feed and every time you put something
[SPEAKER_00]: else in it, that place picks it up and
puts it into your device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow or not, the whole technology
works, but you just have one RSS feed
[SPEAKER_00]: other than YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, YouTube, I have to make a separate
video for it because it's a video,
[SPEAKER_00]: not audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works on everything, but Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't, you're obviously,
you've obviously found it because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quit complaining, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to leave a negative fucking
review and be a troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he said, like I said, it used to
be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not happy with what you're
getting, uh, you can listen to the Adam
[SPEAKER_00]: Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Marijuana Today Daily with Shay
Gunther.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great fucking show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, dude, shaping fire with Shango Lowe's
is a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all shows I can recommend for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably 12 more that I just
can't think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the top of my head because I'm on the
spot, but listen to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, uh, to anybody listening to fucking
cannabis grow podcast, here's a great plug
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis innovation and sciences with
Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, listen to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't enjoy mine anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you do enjoy mine, listen to that
because dude, you learn so fucking much,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spread knowledge is what this is all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get out of this loop of this
negative review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've given way too much time
to a negative review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's we shouldn't have gone that far,
but shout out to Yolo grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not living up to your standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said some things that bothered you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can't make everybody happy and I'm
just being me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we won't take grabs together.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always send hate mail to at Nemo Punk
15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He already sent his fucking hate mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right here in a public forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you've got reviews,
positive or negative, uh, you can send
[SPEAKER_00]: them to go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is go to the podcast on
iTunes, like just like you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you scroll, if you hit available
episodes and then scroll, it'll show best
[SPEAKER_00]: of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you keep scrolling and then
ratings and reviews will pop up,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, right underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the first, it'll say ratings
and reviews, and then it'll show 5.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause so far I've got an average of 5.0
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on how many stars you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, honestly, I could, obviously I could
deal with the honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right underneath that is writer
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and type in a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think of the show and
I will read your review on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do appreciate everybody who has left
a review in the past positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got love for all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to a guy
named James Butterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, every time I post a YouTube
video, our buddy James Butterson is all
[SPEAKER_00]: over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving me credit, giving me thanks,
giving me praise, uh, giving me cool ass
[SPEAKER_00]: emojis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to James Butterson for
all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that because we've been
talking for a long freaking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't talked much about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you want to talk about some
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very, uh, it's a moral and
practical question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got fucking serious on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just channeling some Val Kilmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That felt more Sheldon Cooper to me,
but real geniuses, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we've covered all that stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put a check mark right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the fun part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're still listening,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's episode 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not one of those super
informative episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the more, uh, education and
conversation sort of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's nodding his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't work on a podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some rocks in your mouth so we can
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a while back, a few people have asked
me, not a while back over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: several people have asked me what my
favorite strain is and being a breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: having grown for so long, selecting one
strain to be my favorite is like asking
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike to pick which of his two kids is his
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he knows that's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night, it's so easy to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you caught me two days ago,
this would have been a hard choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may listen one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say it, but no, honestly,
you guys, but I have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to, I don't want to boast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a bragful thing I have worked
with and it's easiest to keep track of how
[SPEAKER_00]: many strains I've read by thinking of the
males I have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used grateful dog for commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the King Kim grapestomper OG male
for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the daybreaker male for commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the rise male for commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus there was a reversed golden goat that
didn't do a lot of projects, but it did
[SPEAKER_00]: make the golden goat feminine seeds and it
made the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a strawberry diesel project a
long time ago that didn't go anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: other than a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lemon Kush remember the lemon
Kush that I've read custom job for that
[SPEAKER_01]: one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, was that a strawberry diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never knew the strain that went into it,
which is why I asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, see you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Mike doesn't know some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those seeds got sent to somebody
in another state and then they got raided
[SPEAKER_00]: with those plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the DEA said that those were the best
plants they've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, this is the most amazing
cannabis plants we've ever seen is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the dude told me that the DEA said,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe anyway, where the shit was I just
something fun to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a lot of stuff is what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got a lot of things to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: From, uh, the lemon sorbet is amazing,
which somebody has taken the name of it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I never released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred it and I gave a few seeds out to a
few friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it the lemon sorbet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, somebody took that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, what I was calling lemon sorbet
was the grateful dog and lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that'll probably never be released
because that's a pain in the ass to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make enough seeds when you
breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I made a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, black cherry chem scarlet begonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great stuff to choose
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capelton, Kalanji, uh, burning spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I called coffee cake for a
while that nobody got to see, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker and forum cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was a lot of private stuff that
stayed around here that didn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some chem crosses that didn't
go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a bunch of grateful dog crosses
that we just got to try and house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are, there's chem four to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got chem four to arise that has never
even happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picking a favorite's a bitch is what we're
getting at folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to pick a favorite out of all
of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick your favorite Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I narrowed it down to three favorites
just because I kind of put them into
[SPEAKER_00]: categories and I chose three that I bred
just because it made it a little easier
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to step out and mention
something of other breeders of stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not breed, I would have to go with
DNA genetics is holy grail kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of the DNA genetics kushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know a lot of people are haters,
but back in the day I had a clone or I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a plant of vortex that was fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are several other breeders that
put out great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, uh, some Cali connection stuff
that was fucking rad, uh, that sour OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so the holy grail kush,
the sour OG and that vortex a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: ago are probably some of the best that
I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the P 91 is some of the best weed I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, my three favorites that I have
bred, I keep building up the hype just
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I'm good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to go with the grateful dog
and we'll talk about the grateful dog for
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I should ask you your three
favorites first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been more fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the great dogs on my list for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, uh, so let's talk about your
three favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I'm just building it up even
better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about your three favorites
and then we'll get into Mike's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them written down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grateful dog is definitely on my
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just an absolutely phenomenal
strain, wonderful stone and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it almost instantly takes my back pain
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my original favorite was a sour
diesel or in New York city, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a lot of imitations now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one that used to go around here
that you could put in a baggie in a jar in
[SPEAKER_00]: your backpack, in the back of the car and
the car next to you would go, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have that diesel in there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, different spots around Colorado where
you could get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I still, that's what I still,
when I say sour diesel, that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: picturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut that you're familiar with around
here is also known as the Gardner diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: and it smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, uh, if you're in an illegal area,
that is not the strain to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an illegal place,
that is not the strain to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is troublesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the grateful dog, which I'm
going to talk about why that's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, the sour diesel, that original
sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know why you love that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I smoked that one, it makes my
eyes squint and itch and like all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes my body tingle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets me right in the eyes every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eye squint is definitely, uh,
dominant in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for number three, it's,
it's a tough choice, but I have to go with
[SPEAKER_01]: something lemony, like a super sour lemon
or a super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've always been a fan of that lemony
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even if it's a real light back
flavor in the herb, that's in my
[SPEAKER_01]: wheelhouse for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we got the grateful dog for that
pungentness and the effect that sour D,
[SPEAKER_01]: not breakfast herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the sour D, which is that,
that face herb for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something lemony, which is
probably more for your uplifting kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: breakfasty sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking when you're trying to
calm down and chill out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it sounds like everything you talked
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relax, calm down, put your feet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cause it's got a, we'll talk
about grateful dog here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cause it's got the, uh, SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got San Fernando Valley, OG cushion
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been doing a lot of, uh,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The colon OG, the white Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, um, that's grateful dog flow and
the other name with the other strain name
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, but a lot of the, just the
heavier indicates in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be working for people with
an OG too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got some, uh, Kim D I 95 flowers
and they seem to make me like drowsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not productive herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good or good herb, even though it's
not good herb for getting shit to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people down the street with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, people down the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the people that own the legal
dispensary down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured they would be, um, so uh,
the reason that I, uh, switched over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is because I knew that we would agree
with the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog is one of my top three
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, uh, so the grateful dog is the,
it's SFV, it's chem 91, the skunk VA cut
[SPEAKER_00]: cross to San Fernando Valley, OG Kush F4
to make dead head OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected my favorite cut out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one got reversed and made seeds out
of, what are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Fino hunt for this is one of my most
enjoyable projects that I've ever done
[SPEAKER_01]: with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there were like 20 different jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of us that got,
uh, if you ever did like water color
[SPEAKER_01]: colors in like third grade, you get these
little plastic cups of paint and he popped
[SPEAKER_01]: a little plastic lid off each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got those with like a quarter gram of
every different strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to narrow it down from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we all got together with our own
selection lists, went through each one
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were incredibly thorough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of those were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going back after I made the S one
seeds to go find more of those was even
[SPEAKER_00]: more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I mean, it was like a year and
a half worth of work picking just the
[SPEAKER_01]: winners out of that first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because Kevin was involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pops was involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of people at least a half
dozen of us testing Finos and testing all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different, what, which one do you like
the best bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody came back on the same one
eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to talk about what they all
got named, but no need to go down that
[SPEAKER_00]: route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a number nine was selfed,
which made, and see, this is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury messes with me, but I don't
remember if I called that one GD 77 or
[SPEAKER_00]: just GD because there was a GD 77 and a
GD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they've all just become the grateful
dog because there's only one left in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all been called other than the
keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a number nine was selfed and
it made the grateful dog 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, no, it made the grateful dog
because I didn't need the number 77 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of it yet to identify anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took number nine, I selfed it and
that made the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took the pollen from number nine and
I put that on the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what made 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one I'm working with now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody's, not a lot of people have
heard the 77 part, but when there were 77
[SPEAKER_00]: is my favorite year of the grateful dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was 72, 77, a few other years or
that's, that's why it got 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I denoted this specific
plant as GD 77.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember right after we finished this
project or you finished this project,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody was like, it's just the phenol of
dead head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and like two years worth
of a bunch of people's lives and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: dedication and work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of why I don't even bring it
up sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over all that crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've passed that insecure crap,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read a fucking negative comment and
laughed my way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm having fun with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing things okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your first strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your second strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, dude, I want to talk about the
grateful dead just for a couple more
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that first one to a party and a
couple of people here at the house had
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but we're all, you guys are all my
best friends and I'm growing because you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, I was also your caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was your number one choice for herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was what you were familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like going to your favorite
restaurant and getting your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're going to get every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you guys were, it was like being,
it was like being fucking Joe Rogan at the
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could walk up there and just pull one
nut out of my pants and everybody will
[SPEAKER_00]: laugh for 45 fucking minutes because I'm
Joe Rogan at the comedy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put my ball back away and walk off
stage and everyone will go, he fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys were an easy audience for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to you guys, but you guys were
going to be happy because I knew how to
[SPEAKER_00]: cater to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that weed to another party of
people that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not always around and they don't
always smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And into the party, people are drinking
and a couple of people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: is anybody got any weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I got a little bit of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a little bit of weed and pull out
some fucking weed and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached into my pocket and I pull out a
little jar of grateful dog of the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with and I cracked the lid
open and everybody in that fucking party
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I broke that bud open,
they're like, that's like the best weed
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when I knew I had something
magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow, even people that like,
they have no reason to care to tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good weed, but they're all,
they want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I was like, yeah,
I got something special here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I already knew, but maybe for me,
but I didn't know other people were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to love it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to dread grateful dead or grateful
dog harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got me fucking saying,
because you'd get home and you'd have to
[SPEAKER_01]: shower like head to toe four times just to
get some of the smell out of your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just bury itself in skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was so disgustingly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about grateful dog enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you guys are bored with that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is the next one on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is a cross of a it's lemon
skunk from greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lemon skunk is a fun plant to grow,
but it doesn't, we've talked about it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't put out enough weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts out long skinny buds that smell
like fucking lemony soft candy and ice
[SPEAKER_00]: cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really sweet candy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't, I'm not a huge fan of the
way it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reversed golden goat and I put the
reversed golden goat pollen on the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk to make lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes these big beefy arm size
buds, huge, huge buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can beat someone with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and they or make that person me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is so sweet and the buds are so
sticky and the high is exactly what I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted at the time when I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I smoke lemon Jeffrey,
if I'm like, if you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some days you wake up, you're like,
oh shit, where are my keys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I got to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke lemon Jeffrey and all the what's
going on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, yeah, I'm going to get my
keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get my shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drive to the gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to go kick today's ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all just comes together when you smoke
the lemon Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way it grows and I love the
high from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about the high from lemon Jeff all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is the total opposite of the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog makes me go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I smoke the grateful dog,
I get like, you know, those things they
[SPEAKER_00]: put on horses at parades so the horses
can't see the blinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get those when I were you going to lean
in and say, no, yeah, he started making
[SPEAKER_01]: the I guess would be the hand motion for
blinders and covering the sides of his
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I leaned into the mic to say blinders
when we finally got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was thinking of the word,
but I feel like I got those on when I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get into this little bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't mess with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I want to write a podcast or
write music or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff to go with the hood on
the hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey fucking take off the
sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk to everybody like,
what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's like if you were a medical
patient and you needed a boost for work,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in your employment wasn't where you
could get fucking if you want to wake and
[SPEAKER_00]: bake and go to work stoned lemon Jeffries,
the shit to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we'll move forward to my number
three choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are probably wondering why I
haven't said this one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my proudest creations because
it has the potency, the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like a fucking champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds like a goddamn soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it to the best of my knowledge,
for quite a while, if not still,
[SPEAKER_00]: it held the record for highest THC potency
lab test with Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at thirty four point eight percent
is what I think I read correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be wrong, but I think it's
thirty four point eight percent THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is my strain arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a golden goat female that was
pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode about arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear a lot of details,
listen to the arise episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, go to Leafley and leave a review on
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafley doesn't have arise posted yet,
but if enough of us leave a review on the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, they will post it up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get arise up on Leafley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lemon Jeffries already up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: No need to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their seeds aren't available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just make people angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But arise, we need to get that up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But arise is one of my favorites because
being a breeder, I saw two plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: were so far apart that I was like,
oh, like that's what you kind of look for
[SPEAKER_00]: as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point of mixing chocolate and
chocolate?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get chocolatey chocolate
and that I never understood the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took is vanilla vanilla as I could
get, which is I'm going to say that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost tastes like juicy fruit gum with
a Hawaiian pineapple sort of a flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: some oranges and some citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I cross that one to we'll call it
the chocolate version.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark, dark chocolate would be my
daybreaker male, which was feedy and fuely
[SPEAKER_00]: and to smell like dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goats got these skinny leaves
and it's tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that daybreaker had those fat leaves
and grew that cushy, stretchy structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like that right there is how you
make a nice swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just get dark chocolate or just
bright white vanilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get I'm going to see I'm
going to be able to mix in that chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: and vanilla mixture right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to see traits of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I nailed it like arise gave me exactly
what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are the shape I thought they
were going to be the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I had totally anticipated the
aromas were what I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a chef going, oh, if you put
in this so much of this on this much of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you'll make the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had Pam or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking emerald that shit to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a fucking good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to food network in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that one girl who is really
beautiful?
[SPEAKER_01]: I picture it was way too raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a joke guy with the forearms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's who I was pictured just now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what plants grave.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Bruno on it, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is becoming idiocracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said when I don't don't get me started,
we're going to do another two hours on why
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's fucked now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cannabis more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's high potency, good flavor,
good aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed within arise mail and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very unique arise mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a lot of seeds to find that
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that you won't find a good
one if you try and go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to breed with my stuff,
I encourage you but the one I found I went
[SPEAKER_00]: through a lot of packs of seeds to find I
went through a jar of fucking seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: find this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I would do it as read I'd run
10 and I'd be like, pull all the girls and
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably got five boys like that boy
right there is the stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's run 10 more seeds and pull all the
girls out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those other five boys gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got those five boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one right there is a stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have two standing next to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I filled up the tent until I had the
whole tent filled with people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: running a second time and then I ran on
the second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, check those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would just, nope, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally I found that one and I
was like, dude, look what this fucker
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a top his top cola was the
whole plant and it was like six feet long
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was just all coated in big chunky
bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's that's a breeder
mail right there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's done some work arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I've got King Solomon is a stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I put that pollen on just it
wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a great fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes great progeny and it doesn't
dominate so much to where it's all arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts it puts the potency, the vigor,
the growth and the resistance in there
[SPEAKER_00]: that PM resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get the flavors and the
aromas from the mom still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grateful dog, lemon, Jeffrey and arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my three favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike went with the grateful dog,
the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something lemony, probably super lemon
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that maybe because you trimmed a
super lemon haze for so long for one of
[SPEAKER_01]: our year associates, like hundreds of
different Finos for different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just comfortable for a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like going home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that that flavor, it's it's like a
smell from childhood or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I like it when it's in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scientists have done research and the
most addictive terpene tobacco companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarette companies have done the research
and the most addictive terpene is
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that we're most our bodies
desire most and we get easily addicted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that they call some dad kids
tree basers because we just keep going
[SPEAKER_00]: back for another dad because sometimes you
just can't do there's a jar over here
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled sweeties.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to smell that fight in the
urge to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's because I'm addicted to
the hash, but it's just so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got 15 jars in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets hard not to fiddle with them,
let alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a dab sitting on a dabber here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hoping to get you on a rant long
enough where I could take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fun to go on a rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that sweeties, bro, something about
that sweeties when you hit it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you blow it out and you go probably go for
another dab of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about getting high or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the flavor of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't people say, well,
if you want that flavor, just eat that
[SPEAKER_00]: candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about that's why people
vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't totally get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get it because you just want that
sweeties coating all over your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't get that in a way from
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only maybe vaping and dabbing are the
only way that that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to add nicotine to the whole
why people vape thing, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as someone who's hooked on nicotine,
that's powerful as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I smell those guys blowing fucking
blueberry cupcake clouds, how much of that
[SPEAKER_00]: has nicotine in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But enough so that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a device to help people quit
smoking as a primary sales method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that all of them had
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought some of it was that fully could
be the like this is the little kid with
[SPEAKER_01]: the untreatable seizure disorder thing
that we get with our like it's a smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of the consuming population
than you might guess from the TV coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys are trying to blow a ring through
a ring and then dance through the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and then blow a dragon through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there's nicotine in all of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd probably get I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the first and only time I
bought vape juice, which if you've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: heard Lewis Black's rant on soy juice,
I just kind of went through the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I saw the mouth vomit when I bought
vape juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had three or four different potencies
of nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my dumb ass was like, give me the big
one, because like the whole point is like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have to sit there and hit
this continuously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to puff on it three or four to five
times, go back inside for two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I chose poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way too fucking much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the closest I've ever been to ODing on
nicotine was twice within that week long
[SPEAKER_01]: period where I was playing with a vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've heard your story about that,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of the hill about to vomit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving over this fairly busy hill on
a fairly busy street, just puffing on this
[SPEAKER_01]: little nicotine vape, not thinking about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden the whole world starts
to fucking vibrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to throw up and I'm
sweating like mad and I'm confused because
[SPEAKER_01]: it feels like I'm having an adverse
reaction to an intoxicant, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming intoxicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you realize.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the truck stopped at the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm puffing on this little vaporizer
stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't even thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up dabbing nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like dabbing, but I mean, basically
dabbing nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cigarette hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to burp, but I'm going to
burp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just burp here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people haven't gotten sick from vape
fluid because there's a lot of nicotine in
[SPEAKER_01]: that little bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just pass out and let it pass or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicotine toxicity is fucking lethal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills a couple of people a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many, like three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're taking those big clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows where that stuff's from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese companies don't care what they're
sending to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give a fuck what they put in
stuff they're shipping overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: A famous comedian told a story about he
was in China and he discovered what they
[SPEAKER_00]: use for cooking oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the street carts to get your
noodle bowl, that cooking oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: they lift up the manhole cover and reach
into the sewer and pull out a ladle of
[SPEAKER_00]: sewer juice, sewer water, sewer,
whatever's passing by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pour that into the little pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they use to cook up your
noodles in the wok.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're doing that to their own people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on the street that are watching
them do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine what they're fucking sending to
you telling you it's a vape juice or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every five years there's another scandal
where they're like this big product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one point it was like lead
paint on kids' toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toothpaste for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dog toys all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the time to research what you're
buying and get it from a reliable source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't matter if it's weed or
water or cell phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably why I feel weird when
I smoke a blunt is I'm getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not into smoking blunts,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why sometimes you guys,
when you pass me a blunt, I'll take one
[SPEAKER_00]: good hit off of it and pass it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't take it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tobacco high gets to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke like four dabs just to get
that to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a second drug when you
throw it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why so many people
pretend like it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can see you start fidgeting when
it's cigarette time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can see your body change and your
brain shifts gears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't address it like it's
that's a real addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I laugh when people like weeds
addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey, I'm addicted to a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We day one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it's not possible to get
addicted to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying it's really fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the cigarettes are the devil though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there, yeah, there's several commonly
sold products like Mountain Dew,
[SPEAKER_01]: nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take either of those away from me,
I'm a fuck you up in like six hours max.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of us is going to die or I'm getting
out of here and acquiring those two
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike's not a little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out of his God damn way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like international flights get scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been teaching the podcast listeners
that if you're in law, in an interaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was much harder to say than it should
have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in an interaction with law
enforcement and you're a large male like
[SPEAKER_00]: us, uh, just sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, because some little cops,
smaller average size cops will look at us
[SPEAKER_00]: like, fuck, I hope he doesn't do anything
squirrely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to act a little
skittish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're my size, your size, just sit on
the curb and cross your legs and chill
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to feel more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move forward with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got a weird look on his face now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, Oh, it's four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look right at the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four 20, four 20 everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we said that like we were some sort of
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy four 20 everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's episode three 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit celebratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do much grow talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, talked about our favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rambled quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read one Facebook comment
because this was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured it was a monumental moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy said, Hey, RJ, which is for
Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, greetings from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's up over the pond, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know that people are listening
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick one to say thanks for all the
time and effort you put into the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely pro gratis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes, it is my gift to you because I
love you and I love cannabis and I want
[SPEAKER_00]: you to grow the best cannabis you can so
that, uh, you can take the best care of
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and I have to give your money to
somebody that doesn't care about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I look forward to each show or to
each new show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always rewarded with plain,
sensible advice that follows Einstein's
[SPEAKER_00]: idiom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't explain it, sorry,
I'm going to back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't explain it simply,
then you do not understand the subject
[SPEAKER_00]: well enough for the new generation of
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and a couple of notable others will be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal or Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a fatty dab for me and give your mama
hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he signed it with his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep them anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, dude, this guy just said, I'm the
next, I'm one of the next Ed's or Jorge's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never thought of the show in those
terms, but I don't disagree at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I realized that,
but that is, yeah, they are, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: the generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck my generation, the generation after
me, my daughter's generation, they want
[SPEAKER_00]: their information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's in a book, they'll never find
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's on the internet, there's a good
chance they'll find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's delivered audio while they're
driving, they might, might get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a much more, uh,
opportune chance of them finding that
[SPEAKER_00]: info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So podcasting is going to be one of the
major learning sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is going to be one of the major
learning sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I do agree with that and thank
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, uh, I hope that doesn't make me
nervous, but I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really cool compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never, I don't think I thought about
that, that we are a little extra weight
[SPEAKER_01]: for the upcoming Roe series.
[SPEAKER_00]: The torch has been passed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The torch is deaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing Ed maybe in the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like a decade ago and you could
tell that every question he was asked for
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire hour, he was answering panel
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, fuck again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do this every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you not hear me last year?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, she was just so burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I won't need somebody with passion
to get people interested in learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some passion and some energy and
fish, uh, the fish weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish weekend really refreshed me feel
recharged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some, I got some recharge,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recharge, recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're funny at that recharge growing tall
and growing fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: My roots are strong, but, uh, dude,
this, this email just meant a lot of this
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's came from Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool to know that I've got people
listening in the UK because I see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: really crazy cannabis news coming out of
the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad good cannabis information is
also making its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me know where you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys send me a tweet or send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Twitter me it's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know where you're listening
from, or you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at a grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell me where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got my, my curiosity sparked now,
dude, episode three 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: 350 episodes and I've got at least 25 or
50 more planned and I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: episode four 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Oh, we're going to sign a plow through
400.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to plow right through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shooting for a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep it free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to keep it free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to do any of that pay for
stuff sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to say names to point
fingers, but yeah, there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, that Mike comes over and hangs
out and does this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no funding for Mike in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, it's, you know, it would be
really fucking cool if we both got a
[SPEAKER_01]: paycheck for doing this, but that's not
why either of us do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do get some Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a generous amount of funding every
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not like fucking paycheck style,
but it is, it's great that covers the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer and the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it covers the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: This computer was purchased on a best buy
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Mike does not smell like someone's
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I buy these little Mike covers and I
buy these bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the payment goes, this computer
payment is covered with that and the wifi
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cable internet here is super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it covers that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is definitely notice that keeps
the podcast doesn't cost me anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be free for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and as long as I can keep it free
until they do some weird shit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet to where I have to pay the
podcast or something, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what I'm wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want, I'm here to make cannabis better,
not get rich off of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys to grow the best herb you
can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can medicate yourself or your
loved ones the best that they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: medicated so they can find what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to spend your money
with either a dispensary, a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: company, or depending on where you are,
the black market, try to keep you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: taken care of safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original goal of just help more people
be better informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've kind of been money'd be nice,
but as long as we're meeting that first
[SPEAKER_01]: goal, I'm super happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been blessed to do this long enough
to have a great understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was, I was doing it before we should
admit doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, thanks to John or whoever you
believe in, I'm knocking on wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm clapping my hands, throwing salt over
my shoulders, crossing my fingers to your
[SPEAKER_01]: hard work and dedication to a couple of
simple rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were nothing horribly wrong ever
happened in those times of prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was doing this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I did quite well during
prohibition times, uh, not to,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to be, but when prohibition was here,
things were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we were never hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hungry now, but we were fucking
spoiled when prohibition was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they never got myself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, I always took care of other
people in those times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you came by and you just didn't
have any funds that get you as high as I
[SPEAKER_00]: could possibly fucking get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always, here's a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a bowl, sit on my couch,
play some video games.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been me and get you stone and
feed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we've always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like since I didn't get in
trouble back in the day and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: blessed enough to be in something that I
just love, like cannabis is awesome to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I wake up thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what are we going to grow today?
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing this, I feel like this is my give
back for not getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my give back for kind of being
allowed to do what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love what you do, you don't work a
day in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come in here and doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there are some evenings when I
try to say the word cannabis and I say
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis fucking 17 times in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to throw the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone through the fucking computer
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the end of the night, when I'm done
recording, it all feels great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me to say I like to grateful that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens when you talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tongue goes weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I haven't learned to accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been times when people have wanted
me to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to miss shows and parties and
social interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to minimize social interaction
time sometimes because of trying to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put in about three hours from like when
I show up to when I leave to put together
[SPEAKER_01]: like a 45 minute hour and 10 minute show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different when you're not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, it goes much smoother when you're
solo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, that's not work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't feel like I put in three hours
at a job, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, it's, it's very different when
you really enjoy what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel privileged to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys appreciate all the listeners
sending feedback and not hate mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys see these upcoming episodes,
when you hear them, you'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, he stayed up late because some of
these are quite lengthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to pull one up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike can see how many several pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that one's a shorty too,
but yeah, there, this is the next episode
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one, two, just two pages,
but lots of notes on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of little bullet points and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, putting a lot of work into you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a lot of good stuff
coming up in the future.

rant, but thank you guys for listening.
