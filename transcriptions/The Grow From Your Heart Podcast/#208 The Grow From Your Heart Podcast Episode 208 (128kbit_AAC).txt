[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Rasta Jeff, and it's time for episode
number 208 of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_09]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Thursday, so I'm posting a throwback
Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am posting episodes 39, 40, and 41 of
what used to be the iGrowCulture podcast,
[SPEAKER_09]: now known as the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we get to these old episodes,
let me make a couple of updates and
[SPEAKER_09]: disclaimers.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the social media has changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: The new email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[SPEAKER_09]: the Twitter is at GFYHpodcast,
and on Facebook, you can just search for
[SPEAKER_09]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love it if you stalk me on all of
the social media.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there may be some advertisements and
promotions for old products and old
[SPEAKER_09]: sponsors.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of those have expired.
[SPEAKER_09]: I currently do not have any sponsors.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have any advertising.
[SPEAKER_09]: So any ads or anything that may be said in
this episode, those expired a long time
[SPEAKER_09]: ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there will be a lot of great content
in these episodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So without any more rambles, ladies and
gentlemen, let's get to episodes 39,
[SPEAKER_09]: 40, and 41 of what used to be the
iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: iGrowCulture podcast currently known as
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have no idea what just happened at
this table right now, but I wish I would
[SPEAKER_09]: have hit record about five minutes ago,
because some of that shit was priceless.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, welcome to episode number 39 of the
iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess who I got back at the table,
guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse's here.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, podcast land?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, you sound great on that microphone.
[SPEAKER_09]: We made a couple of tech adjustments.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like I poured some super thrive
into the mixing gear here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got it going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjusted the timing a little.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we got a new muffler bearing in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's running quite smooth.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a couple of episodes, we talked about
building a grow room and I got Jesse to
[SPEAKER_09]: come back and kind of wrap that up a
little more for us, which ironically,
[SPEAKER_09]: he might have been working in a grow
space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you learn anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 year old houses are 150 year old
houses.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it brick or is it like drywall and
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everything's brick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, that's going to definitely come in
handy in the talk later because I wrote
[SPEAKER_09]: some shit and it's all about building a
room inside of a room and we're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: need to do that in Jesse space,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_09]: But before we get to that part,
let's pay some bills.

[SPEAKER_09]: That's a steal and I might need to go
stock up on that, that space right there

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know that was going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just learned about that at the same time
the listeners did.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a good response, we'll just
probably keep it that way.

[SPEAKER_09]: it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: The more of you that use it, they'll see

going to check out the string cheese
[SPEAKER_09]: incident in Denver on New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of random for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen the cheese in years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a friend who needs a cheese buddy
for New Year's.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm going to be the cheese buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite a cheesy buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's enough ads for the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that covered everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also check out naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't do a big ad for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are sold out of iRegenetics products

[SPEAKER_09]: Genetics, the plot of labs in Sin City.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have a coupon code for them this
month.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once I give them a refill, they'll get a
sweet coupon code.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys will get hooked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, what's been going on?
[SPEAKER_09]: We had an election last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado did not have much cannabis
initiative on the ballots.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we did have number 105 regarding
non-GMO food.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was the labeling of GMO foods.
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado, dude, you failed, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_09]: This was supposed to pass.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to get too much into it
because it's already happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted them to have to mark genetically
modified food products with some sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: indication that it is genetically
modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enriched with GMOs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did not pass this.
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell is going on, Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it failed by a landslide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the really disappointing part.
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked your, Jesse wrote a really good
Facebook post.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said something to the effect of,
that's okay, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to share my organic produce
with you anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse's tomatoes are delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am addicted.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only one other place I've eaten
recently that's got tomatoes nearly as
[SPEAKER_09]: tasty as Jesse's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where that place is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they get so many shout outs on this
podcast?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm addicted to that place.
[SPEAKER_09]: I eat there a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up there with Bern and Bern's
cousin and they made customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: They made friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: They treat you like your family when
you're there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They know my name by now.
[SPEAKER_09]: They start writing down my order when they
see me online.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, you want the same thing,
dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that many Made different
drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little overwhelmed at first.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little strange.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first time you walk in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the vibe there is very unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you walk in, you're almost in a
new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn your cell phone off when you go in
there, please.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, but there are so many people in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gone late at night and midday.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go during the day, it's 20
somethings with their MacBooks and their
[SPEAKER_09]: iPhones all over the place.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're right, around 11 or 12,
I wish we could get everyone to put their
[SPEAKER_09]: phones away and chill out because it's
really chill in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some people playing chess and a
couple of people looked like they were on
[SPEAKER_00]: a date or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just real chill.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy's playing chess in there,
looked like robots.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're so good at chess, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one guy, I swear he was playing chess
with the guy in front of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was also playing it on his
iPad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is predicting what could happen or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've got a funny joke that only a few
listeners are going to get.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were at, we're talking about a place
called The Mate Factor and they make Yerba
[SPEAKER_09]: Mate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Brazilian energizing tea.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have two different kinds.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the dark Yerba Mate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they have got the green Yerba
Mate, which I prefer the green iced and I
[SPEAKER_09]: like the dark hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my preference.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I need a cool drink, I'll get the
green one.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy was describing the differences to
a customer who it's in a really touristy
[SPEAKER_09]: area.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get a lot of touristy kind of
people that are describing this drink to a
[SPEAKER_09]: tourist.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said that the dark roast is the
dried leaves that have been sat out and
[SPEAKER_09]: they've dried and they crumble it and then
they brew it or they grind it and then
[SPEAKER_09]: they brew it together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said the green is more the
freshest.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't been dried and set up for as
long.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I heard him say that and I looked at
the girl that was with me and I said,
[SPEAKER_09]: he's talking about that live res.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a few listeners are going to laugh at
that, but that's exactly the description
[SPEAKER_09]: that worked perfectly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about that live resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: The dark roast is the dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the fresh green is a live res.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can taste the difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a huge, bold difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had only ever had the green before I
went up there and I got the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, this is the shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know that this is going to
happen, but if anybody that listens to
[SPEAKER_09]: this podcast goes to The Mate Factor in
Manitou Springs, say something about,
[SPEAKER_09]: you heard about, say, I heard about this
place from the I Grow Culture podcast and
[SPEAKER_09]: they told me to say hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then maybe they'll catch on because
they know who I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've said that I'm the host of a show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe one day they'll, maybe I just
want a free veggie wrap out of the deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a free muffin from them the other
night.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were really kind to give me a fresh,
warm, free muffin.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of talk about The Mate
Factor.
[SPEAKER_09]: The place is so good, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go up there, go hike on Rainbow
Falls.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never said nothing about the secret
Rainbow Falls.
[SPEAKER_09]: That place is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can find it, go hike it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Graffiti Falls.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're talking about the votes that
happened last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oregon, Alaska, and Washington DC have
legalized recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cool Kid Club.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Florida on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just old people in Disney World
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people in Florida do you think
could actually reduce their pain
[SPEAKER_00]: medication consumption drastically?
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you think that maybe some of those
pain companies, the pain clinics kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: lobbied against all of this medical
cannabis or cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, surely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would think a big major
corporation would have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity than that.
[SPEAKER_09]: A good honest company that would need to
do something like that because that would
[SPEAKER_09]: be kind of cheating and dishonest.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's poisoning their citizens.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, come on Big Pharma.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you did not go out and vote,
you can't bitch about what happened in
[SPEAKER_09]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you voted in Florida, and I'm sorry
you did not get your cannabis rights
[SPEAKER_09]: there, Oregon, Alaska, and Washington DC,
however, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, unless for some reason
they're listening to this and they voted
[SPEAKER_00]: against it, then go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will second that, but I will not pay the
fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's tallied up how many times I said
the F word on so many episodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So whoever was paying attention,
you got to go math that up for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to discontinue that
actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to stop doing it because I
haven't said that in quite a long time on
[SPEAKER_09]: the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody let me know what I owe and I'll
pay it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit you on two for one episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't remember which one or when or
where or anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's Dreadful J.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you girl?
[SPEAKER_09]: He always listened to the show and remind
me of funny stuff that I said.
[SPEAKER_09]: So count up those F words.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_09]: Washington DC, our nation's capital now
has legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why doesn't the rest of the nation just
follow suit with what the capital has
[SPEAKER_09]: done?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there are intelligent people in DC
contrary to popular belief.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they'll change some of their
habits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like while they're up there doing what
they do instead of just droning on and be
[SPEAKER_09]: like, yo, bro, I think that these GMOs are
a crock of shit and we need to knock this
[SPEAKER_09]: shit out, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I get an eye?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then everyone will be like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just made getting a smoking a joint
in front of the White House photo op a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a, there was actually,
I was at garden of the gods and I think I
[SPEAKER_09]: saw a sign that reminded you that that's a
state park and you cannot bring your
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because it's still federal land.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm pretty sure that that White House
land is federal land and you can't have
[SPEAKER_09]: your cannabis there.
Good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you, if you go to a state park right
now in Colorado, people that are not from
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado, this is a random, we did not
prepare this part at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not, if you were in a state park
in Colorado, like Red Rocks is a state
[SPEAKER_09]: park.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most the reservoirs like the Pueblo
reservoir, all the big reservoirs where
[SPEAKER_09]: you'd want to go hang out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the cool shit is a state park.
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot take your, you can,
I mean, you can, they're not stopping
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do, but we're not going to say we do,
but you can take it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's illegal to actually have cannabis at
a state park.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, even if it's legal in DC smoking
a joint at the White House is still going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be a little sketchy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although shout out to Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_09]: Snoop claims that he smoked that weed at
the White House there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also a big shout out to Willie.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know Willie smoked at the White House.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all right, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Clinton smoked something there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Monica Lewinsky smoked something there.
[SPEAKER_09]: She just turned 50 recently and there were
pictures of her online.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to comment on the pictures,
but that did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't that kind of make you feel old?
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That did come to cross my mind,
but all right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been talking about, Jesse and I were
talking about building a room a couple
[SPEAKER_09]: episodes back and we're talking about
planning your grow room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about selecting your space,
being a responsible grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: On this episode, we're going to talk more
about building and setting up your grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to discuss grow tents a little
bit or those hydro huts or whatever you
[SPEAKER_09]: want to call them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe if we have enough time,
we're already 15 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have enough time, I will try to
tackle that $500 grow room question.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be a challenge,
but basically do everything that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing and go much smaller.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't even get to pots and soil and
stuff on the stuff that I've got written
[SPEAKER_09]: and we've got five pages of stuff typed
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is going to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wrapped up the last episode with the
talk about deciding how much light to use
[SPEAKER_09]: in your space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we kind of talked about where you're
going to hang the lights and where you're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to... My phone is making noise.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a poor podcast move right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's already... Nope.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was on silent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that was.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about where you're going to hang
the lights, how you're going to fit the
[SPEAKER_09]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked a little bit about bringing
fresh air into the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now let's kind of talk about building a
room, which is kind of helpful because
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse has a lot of experience in this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to make a clean grow space that
allows you to control the light cycles,
[SPEAKER_09]: the temperature during the day,
the temperature during the night,
[SPEAKER_09]: and you need to control the humidity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's also ideal to have a lot of
control over the air going in and out of
[SPEAKER_09]: the grow space.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're using an extra bedroom or a
closet, you'll have all the walls already
[SPEAKER_09]: built, but you'll need to work around the
existing room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse was talking about working in a brick
building or a brick facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know where it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't ask.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to know, but he was talking
about it's 150 years old and it's brick
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's got to suck because you don't
have a thing to screw shit into.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bricks crumble if you hit them.
[SPEAKER_09]: With a hammer and try to put nails into
them, shit can go really wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you move one brick, now you've got that
unstable wall.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm ranting about a brick.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got an open area, like a garage
or a basement, or maybe Jesse's brick
[SPEAKER_09]: area, you're going to need to build a
room.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could just hang lights up in your
garage or in that basement, but it's going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be a lot easier if you build a room or
set up a free prefabricated grow hut
[SPEAKER_09]: because that just gives you actually
control over your environment and an
[SPEAKER_09]: environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Simple reflection and trapping the light
and having it reflect around makes the
[SPEAKER_09]: light up to 30% more efficient is what I
read in a couple of books.
[SPEAKER_09]: One said 20, one said 30.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about we'll settle on 25% more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're running a thousand watt
light, that's 250 watts basically of
[SPEAKER_09]: efficiency that you're going to not lose
by having more reflection.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just putting in a good designed room is
already saving you money and increasing
[SPEAKER_09]: buds because like we talked about on
another show, the light is the main
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrient for your plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not what you pour in.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not what you feed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually the light.
[SPEAKER_09]: So where are we?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's actually get into building a room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking at all kinds of stuff and
trying to figure out how to do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just decided let's kind of build a four
light room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to act like we're building it
either in a garage that's got plenty of
[SPEAKER_09]: room or the basement that's got plenty of
room or maybe in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about the coughs guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been taking dads.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's build a room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need four 1000 watt lights,
an air conditioner, a way to remove the
[SPEAKER_09]: humidity and a way to draw in fresh air.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's choose, like I said, we're going
to do the basement or a garage or
[SPEAKER_09]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we want to build a four light room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to build a room that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is this room?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was just going to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight by eight, because two by fours come
in eight foot sections, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or two by three or whatever we decide to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can get them in tens too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of us aren't going to have a 10 foot
ceiling in our basement or garage.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was going to just stick with the,
you can buy a bunch of eight by eights,
[SPEAKER_09]: a bunch of eight foot, two by four.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you could set up this room in
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You and I could do it in probably five
hours because we've done this enough
[SPEAKER_09]: times.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're going to use a grow hut or
something or a pre-made grow lab,
[SPEAKER_09]: what do you guys, do you guys sell grow
huts over at Hydro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_09]: Supplies?
[SPEAKER_09]: We have grow hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a generic brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the grow lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the grow labs, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The generic brand is different than the
grow labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen one, but we can get a
really good price on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just basic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the grow labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I have too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're grow lab 120s or something
like that, or the five by fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw a thousand watt light in there and
those are awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also make a 10 by 10 one,
which would work perfectly for what we're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be, we're going to basically
build an eight by eight version of that 10
[SPEAKER_09]: by six, 10 feet by 10 feet by six high,
I think, or seven high.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to make an eight by eight
by eight room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best ways to build a room,
even like a big, huge warehouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do is essentially they build a
gigantic grow hut out of two by fours and
[SPEAKER_00]: drywall and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll build a room inside of a room,
even in the vertical commercial lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start with these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes looking at a 10 by 10,
a grow hut, they're kind of expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so is building a 10 by 10 room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can build a 10 by 10,
you can build this eight by eight room.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got the tools and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't build us a house.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got basic skills, but for me,
buying the 10 by 10 hut and snapping those
[SPEAKER_09]: pieces together is so much easier for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if something were to go wrong in your
grow, the thing comes down in an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have everything down, concealed in
one hour, move it to another spot and put
[SPEAKER_09]: it back up, hopefully in another hour with
those grow huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like working in a garage or
a big open basement, I mean, it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to expand and stuff like that,
there's a lot of good reasons to have
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple rooms when it comes to pest
control, equipment failure and all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to double up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you get bugs over in this room or if
you have an equipment, and like you said,
[SPEAKER_09]: if the air conditioner fails in this room,
it didn't fail in every room.
[SPEAKER_09]: It only failed in one light or four lights
worth of stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It only murdered 30 plants instead of a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm glad Jesse said that part about
building a room within a room.
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes in handy sometimes because most
of what I wrote was about building a room
[SPEAKER_09]: inside of a room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say frame out an eight by
eight room that's nice and tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, try to leave as much
headroom as you can, but most of us are
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be in a basement or garage.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be limited on space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I said, if you can use the full
eight foot, two by fours, you're in good
[SPEAKER_09]: luck.
[SPEAKER_09]: So frame out your eight by eight room
wherever you're working.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then here's where I kind of started
getting into detail since Jesse kind of,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad you said build a room inside
of a room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of what I wrote is build a room
inside of a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like big, like restaurants and old
buildings and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they make it sanitary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it look all nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just build a shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called overframing.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So overframe yourself a nice room.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got an eight by eight room,
just framed.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need to frame it like super
rigidly secure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need a couple of cross beams.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 inch studs every 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_09]: So have Jesse or I stand every 24 inches
is what he said.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need a stud every 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plan for a door.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you guys forget doors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the hydro shops sell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you guys have this yet,
but I've seen this at plenty of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a sticker.
[SPEAKER_09]: You stick it right on your, on the Mylar
we're going to talk, or not the Mylar,
[SPEAKER_09]: the poly we're going to talk about later.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then use a razor and you unzip the
zipper.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you unzip it, you just follow your
razor right along with it and cut a hole
[SPEAKER_09]: in the poly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you have a zippered door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not unzip it before you stick it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Has that happened?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to move on because we
don't want to make fun of your customer
[SPEAKER_09]: that did that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to need to put some beams
across the top to hang your equipment.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you've got this eight by eight
building, just, just a frame.
[SPEAKER_09]: Studs every 24 inches, maybe a couple of
cross cause you're going to hang some
[SPEAKER_09]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, uh, roof beams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, depending on if you go all the way
to the, to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you don't go all the way to the
ceiling, um, just stand your, don't lay
[SPEAKER_00]: them down, stand your two by fours up on
the skinny edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, get you some metal clamps and screw
them to the, the top of two walls and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll help support the brace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang lights from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of neat shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we brought Jesse.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why he's here.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you're paying the big bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So once everything's framed up,
uh, you can insulate the room with the
[SPEAKER_09]: blue insulation boards.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to make it more soundproof and
more, uh, have more stable temps.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't find that to be too necessary.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in a basement, if you're in the
garage, maybe because it's going to get
[SPEAKER_09]: colder in the winter and hotter in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the basement, like we talked about
stays fairly cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the time, uh, some people choose
to use plywood or some type of board on
[SPEAKER_09]: the walls, whatever you want is cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Build it how you like at that point.
[SPEAKER_09]: But once you've decided on the walls and
insulation, that's when we hang,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, we call it poly or Panda film.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, poly is basically plastic sheeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's white on one side and black on the
other.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you hang the white side on the inside
of the room and the black side on the
[SPEAKER_09]: outside of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it'll, the white will keep the
reflection of your light in there and give
[SPEAKER_09]: you more efficiency.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you need to cover up the whole room,
the walls, the floor and the ceiling and
[SPEAKER_09]: seal it up with tape.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seal up any spots where bugs can get in,
uh, any spots where light can get out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want it to be a little fortress.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your own private little room.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to seal that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more time you take and the tighter
you get all the plastic and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's less of a spot for, um,
bugs to get and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take your time with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, if you can, if you have a little bit
of overlap everywhere, there's some kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of gap.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're putting your staples in,
put down a little square of duct tape and
[SPEAKER_09]: then the staple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that'll help from the poly tearing
and it'll also keep the staple in a little
[SPEAKER_09]: bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also go back and take a,
a little bit of silicone caulking and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, stick that right over the staple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to make sure I got that in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to have your cock out in
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you've basically built a little
grow hut like we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, most of what we're going to talk about
now works in the grow huts and it
[SPEAKER_09]: translates, that kind of translates to if
you're just working with a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if you'd haven't built a room,
the main difference is you won't have the
[SPEAKER_09]: buffer zone around the grow area.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in a bedroom, you'll need to
vent out of the room or the house without
[SPEAKER_09]: anybody noticing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the room that we've built inside of
the rooms gives you more privacy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like a little bit more control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we, uh, go over a bedroom,
uh, how to vent out a window real,
[SPEAKER_00]: see, uh, snazzy like real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if, when I get to it later on,
we'll just skip it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crack your window open, um,
half inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of depends on how much airflow you
need through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then screw it shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or at least screw it to where it can't
be opened any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do that by, uh, real gently
running a nice three inch screw through
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, most people have vinyl windows,
um, through the, the inside, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: track of where the window goes up and
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll hold the window shut, keep someone
from ripping it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you take your window blinds,
get you a nice, new set of mini blinds or
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, throw that down, close them so that,
you know, no light can go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe leave them open a quarter inch
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, air will still suck through it pretty,
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then take Panda film, put the
white side to the outside of the window,
[SPEAKER_00]: staple it over that, and then take you a
piece of plywood, screw it up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and you can cut holes and mount,
uh, mount fans on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all your ducting and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use one window as an intake and
one window as an exhaust.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever done the thing where you,
uh, put the blinds up, just like you said,
[SPEAKER_09]: you, uh, I would close the window or leave
it open just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to leave it open for what we're
doing on this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Too many ideas in my head.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you leave the half inch gap and then
you build basically a box around the
[SPEAKER_09]: window.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you take some plywood and you make like
three inch deep little square around the,
[SPEAKER_09]: the, like an inch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Around the window.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you put a piece of plywood over
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can put all your ducting in
that plywood.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it almost looks like you could put
like a Christmas light or a candle light
[SPEAKER_09]: or something in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like somebody's home all the
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just makes it look like you got a
light.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can actually use that as
ducting and shit too now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually stuck a Christmas light in
there, a yellow one, and it reflected off
[SPEAKER_00]: all the plastic and everything enough to,
you know, you could just flip it on his
[SPEAKER_00]: little timer and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then now you've got a window open and
it looks like somebody's home.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a light on in there and it looks
like it's just part of the normal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, I had no idea why we would
need to be that secretive.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's mostly, uh, I'm not worried
as worried about the police as I am about
[SPEAKER_09]: the thieves.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually heard a story about some
thieves getting into somebody's air.
[SPEAKER_09]: They went in through their house,
through the air conditioning duct,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're taking their plants while the
people were home.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: They found out, and I shouldn't even be
talking about this because that whatever,
[SPEAKER_09]: but, uh, the people found out their plants
were being stolen because of the cops
[SPEAKER_09]: knocked on the door and found kids running
out their backyard with pot plants.
Oh God.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how that story ended.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bailed on that conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Scary shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope my story about building the box
around the window makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I kind of had a vague idea of how to
do that in my head.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking too many thoughts.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you take, uh, just shape the size of
the window.
[SPEAKER_09]: You add an inch square.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now if your window is 24 by 24,
you make a 25 by 25 square piece of
[SPEAKER_09]: plywood.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you make a freaking box out of
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a half box.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's only, you only need it three
inches deep, make a little tray and then
[SPEAKER_09]: put that up against the window.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can put a curtain and just
make it look like it's a real window.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can math that out in your brain,
I hope.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote a bunch of shit and that's not on
all my notes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just messing with my brain,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where was I on all these papers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate, uh, I hate sloppy, uh,
windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've actually seen a few houses around
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive around and you're like, oh yeah,
there's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, there's actually two that I can
drive to right now and be like,
[SPEAKER_09]: grow house right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can always see the metal halide in the
attic.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hang that poly real carefully.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Jesse said, take your time with the
poly.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're, this is the building of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are your walls.
[SPEAKER_09]: You wouldn't build your house walls all
shitty.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want your plant room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, cover the whole room, seal it up,
seal any spots where shit can get in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we basically, you got that little grow
hut.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we're talking about a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I already did most of the part I'm
talking about, um, or privacy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you've got the room built and
sealed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to use a bedroom,
make sure to clean and dust the bedroom
[SPEAKER_09]: first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's definitely on my list of shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, cover the windows where the light can
get in or get out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cover any cracks.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got cracks in the walls,
cover those, uh, cover all your walls in
[SPEAKER_09]: the bedroom with reflective material.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Panda film works in a bedroom also
pull up the carpet.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have that option, cover the floor
if possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: And right here, I wrote, I like a pond
liner for my floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I like to get the pond liner about
three to four inches up the wall all the
[SPEAKER_09]: way around the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you do accidentally flood your
resin, that room, or you spill a bucket or
[SPEAKER_09]: something, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just got a pond liner there to catch
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the doorway there, uh, to help keep
the doorway all sealed up, just cut you a
[SPEAKER_00]: door, a two by four, um, as wide as your
doorway, stand it up on the outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: screw it in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's a place to staple your
pond liner too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns a whole little bedroom into a
pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to have to step up
when you go in and out, but you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the way you did that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I did it kind of a shitty way in my,
my newest build.
[SPEAKER_09]: It works, but I didn't do it that smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice little air seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it real tight and everything,
you put a piece of foam in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something we're going to talk a
little bit about because some of us are
[SPEAKER_09]: going to have to use that crevice
underneath the door to let air in.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually a pretty good spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: If for some of us and that's because
everything I'm talking about is,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, under ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, I'm just trying to throw
out because there's so many ways you could
[SPEAKER_00]: use, I mean, and so much different
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you walked into, okay, this is a four
bedroom house.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we walked into all four bedrooms and
tried to build a grow room in it,
[SPEAKER_09]: we'd have to deal with different obstacles
in every single room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Each room would have different shit to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_09]: That room's only got a window on that
side.
[SPEAKER_09]: That room, you can't mess with the window.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it's right up against the neighbor's
house.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you exhaust out there, you're going to
be blown into the neighbor's window,
[SPEAKER_09]: basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there'd be some obstacles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So wherever you are, you're going to have
to deal with some shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything we're saying is just kind of,
kind of hopefully going to work for what
[SPEAKER_09]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we've got this clean room,
basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a hut that's sealed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we're going to add, so you get your
eight by eight by eight room.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all Panda filmed, or you've got a 10
by 10 grow hut or whatever, something
[SPEAKER_09]: similar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, now this is where you want to add an
intake and an outtake.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I talked in that last episode a lot
about how important it is to vent your,
[SPEAKER_09]: the air in your grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like those inline style fans or blowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the vortex.
[SPEAKER_09]: Vortex has always been reliable.
[SPEAKER_09]: The can fan is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a little more expensive,
but they're adjustable speed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And dude, those are reliable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, those green hard hydro farm blowers,
those are reliable.
[SPEAKER_09]: They work, but they're loud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the green hydro farm inline
boosters or junk.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste your money on them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse works at a hydro shop and I was not
going to bash any brand, but since he
[SPEAKER_09]: works there and has to order from them,
we'll let him go ahead and talk shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, there's a reason they sell,
uh, so many refurbished ones of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of grow stores who get the,
uh, hydro farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just better shut up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of what he says is allegedly,
and I am not responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like, uh, for the room we're going to
build, we need an eight inch blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm going to say get a can fan or a
vortex and don't buy one of the green
[SPEAKER_09]: hydro farm ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a, um, if you can afford the can fan,
get that the vortex is ideal next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the hydro farm blowers are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, the boosters, the ones that go
in the ducting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all crap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter who makes them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think can fans isn't bad, but it's,
it's not a primary fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is booster on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get the right blower, you don't
need the booster.
[SPEAKER_09]: So add that, uh, let's see, where were we?
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight inch blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Attach the blower, uh, to the framing and
get it fairly high in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of you guys might need to do this in
the dead center of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of you may need to do it off to a
corner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just try to get it high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I think it's better to get the heat
high.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better to dump it out of the room
high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to do everything high.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now this is when you need to decide if
you're going to use vented hoods or open
[SPEAKER_09]: hoods.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, vented hoods are the ones,
uh, just for the people that are new at
[SPEAKER_09]: this, your light reflectors and hoods,
vented ones mean they have glass on the
[SPEAKER_09]: bottom and they're sealed and your ducting
will attach to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the light will be moved away from the
grow and not dropping down onto your
[SPEAKER_09]: plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have open hoods, you're going to
have to have more air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_09]: but you don't have to have as much
ducting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's when you need to think about
what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get more value for your, for your
light that way, but air conditioning is
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the vented style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard I'd say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're in, uh, I've actually seen a
couple of huge rooms that just dump AC at
[SPEAKER_09]: ridiculous levels and it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're supplementing CO2 and stuff,
you can't be exhausting a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a little bit more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if you're really cool kids,
you got the Gavitas or the Nano Luxes or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those Gavitas, you can't duct those.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then you're going to have, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're using Gavitas, you're going
to have to use more air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot more.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot more.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're using open hoods and you're
trying for the ducting situation we're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing, you can just attach a carbon filter
to your eight inch blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you've pretty much finished the
extraction.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're using, uh, make sure you use
the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if that's what I want to add,
make sure you're using the carbon filter
[SPEAKER_09]: on the extraction fan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Crop is going to stink like about week
six.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be able to smell
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hit week five in the middle of week
five in a room and that, uh, that gorilla
[SPEAKER_09]: glue number four.
[SPEAKER_09]: Four is a stinky little bitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you do use vented hoods,
you got to run ducting.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're running four lights in this design.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would do it kind of like this,
but I'm going to take a little drink of
[SPEAKER_09]: this drink first right now, taking a
drink.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was well deserved.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we're building this room with four
lights, I would put a large carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the 39 by eight carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have those available right now at
Hydro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I would take that 38 by eight inch
carb 39 by eight inch carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would use an eight inch wide duct that
goes into two six inch ducks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now my eight just went to two sixes and
I would use the Y to run the ducting to
[SPEAKER_09]: two lights on each side.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would have light one, a light two,
a, and then light one B light to be on
[SPEAKER_09]: opposite sides.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then use another wide duct,
more ducting, and then a wide duct to
[SPEAKER_09]: bring them back together and then attach
that wide duct and the eight inch blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote something where they're attached
that Y and the eight inch blower and the
[SPEAKER_09]: blower send the air out of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something I wrote doesn't make sense,
but attach that wide duct to the blower
[SPEAKER_09]: and then send the air.
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I already have something wrong here
because you should have carbon filter
[SPEAKER_09]: blower is the way it should go.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it should be carbon filter blower,
ducting or carbon filter blower,
[SPEAKER_09]: Y, ducting, light, light, Y, and then out
of the house is where it should go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I typed something different, but I must've
just been high at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a good spot for a booster fan.
[SPEAKER_09]: That right at the end there would be the
perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this case, we're running it out of
the grow hut or out of this eight by eight
[SPEAKER_09]: room that we built.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you're doing the bedroom,
that's when you got to build that little
[SPEAKER_09]: wall and run it out of that duct or that
little box that we made there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a good burp.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad I got that one off the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_09]: In some cases, you're going to need to run
the ducting out of the house or to another
[SPEAKER_09]: room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Booster fans come in handy there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to keep the ducting as short and
straight as possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want a lot of bends in your
ducting and you don't want excessive long
[SPEAKER_09]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if you can, hang your carbon filter
from the ceiling because all of your heat
[SPEAKER_09]: and stale air is going to go up,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air moves just like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got to pump it all the way to
the ceiling from the floor, that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: stealing energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: And heat rises.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're putting that thing up there and
then it won't suck as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hot air stinks more too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it on the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_09]: And your carbon filter will work better if
you keep the humidity at a more acceptable
[SPEAKER_09]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it closer to 50.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get away from that 70%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I've seen a couple of guys in their
flower rooms at 70% humidity because they
[SPEAKER_09]: say it makes the butt sticky.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll make your butt moldy is what you're
going to get, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen flower rooms with 0% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much good old southern color.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to say it's Colorado,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't look at me like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your carbon filter pretty much
quits working at that point too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need some moisture to keep that
charcoal active.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got an exhaust set up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you need air in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on the situation, I might make a
four inch hole, six inches from the
[SPEAKER_09]: corners and six inches off the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: So imagine there's the corner of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would go six inches in and six inches up
and make a four inch hole.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on the opposite side of that
corner, do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that'll give you eight four inch holes
for fresh air.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I go and get those HEPA filters from
Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just little square sheets.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I staple those over the holes to keep
any dirt, bugs, freaking dog hair,
[SPEAKER_09]: hippie hair, keep all that shit out of the
grow room with those HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_09]: They work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use dryer vents to cover and prevent
light leaks right on the outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put those on the outside to where,
or you can put them on the inside too,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you need to, but I like them on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just look smoother.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, the inside may work because
now the light's coming this way.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using them for an intake,
don't forget to take the little flapper
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually heard one going,
I was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to take that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could replace the small holes with one
big hole and you can have a blower in
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do have something bringing air in,
make sure that it is smaller than the
[SPEAKER_09]: exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to suck out more than what you're
bringing in.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to create negative pressure in a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want it to feel, if you have a real
door, if it's in a bedroom, when you open
[SPEAKER_09]: the door, you want to turn the knob and
you want the door to fly open on its own.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you know you got enough
pressure in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's negative.
[SPEAKER_09]: Suck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually thinking of a room I was
just in, so the door would have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll catch up.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get you on the same show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing episode 39.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what number you're on.
[SPEAKER_09]: 42, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, I wonder what's going to happen on
episode 42 because Jesse just jumped to
[SPEAKER_09]: the future on me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It clicked in my brain a second late.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, wait, man, we got to catch up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can replace all those holes with a
big blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got fresh air being pulled in when
the exhaust fan pulls out stale air and
[SPEAKER_09]: humidity out of the room and out of the
house.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that even mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell I was lit when I wrote some
of these notes and it got late.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got fresh air coming in when the
exhaust fan pulls the stale air and
[SPEAKER_09]: humidity out of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can add an air conditioner to bring
in fresh air also.
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be able to bring in enough air
under the bedroom door if you're doing
[SPEAKER_09]: this in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a perfect little grow when I first
started off that was in a bedroom and I
[SPEAKER_09]: had the blower going over one light.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a six inch blower and I was going
over two lights and sucking that straight
[SPEAKER_09]: out of the room and I hung the carbon
filter in the ceiling and I just let the
[SPEAKER_09]: fresh air come right under the door and I
feel like it was enough air.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like it was sufficient in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't get stale.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't get stifled or anything in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that space under the door guys,
that could be useful.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need fresh air coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're building this big eight by
eight room, cut some holes in there or add
[SPEAKER_09]: a blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're using an eight inch blower out,
you can use a four or a six inch blower in
[SPEAKER_09]: I think and you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're running a sealed room,
I hate seeing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little more advanced stuff,
but even sealed rooms need to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to inject fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't use it, but once a week
or something like that, you still need to
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle your air every now and then
pumping CO2 into air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's talking about a control, a closed
environment agriculture room where
[SPEAKER_09]: everything is sealed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only air that goes in the room is CO2
that's supplemented with the CO2 tank.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk a little bit about that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because plants actually breathe CO2 and
let out oxygen, but I think just pumping
[SPEAKER_09]: all that CO2 in there, they are going to
need some oxygen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your roots need oxygen, your
micro-blifing, it gets stale in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to put some oxygen in that closed
room somehow and just use those HIPAA
[SPEAKER_09]: filters and filter your air.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also sell those shroom things,
the shroom covers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big fan of those.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always thought they were a little
overpriced.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've just stuck with the HIPAA filters.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't argue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sell a much bigger intake filter
that's similar to a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not applicable in all situations,
but it's very reasonably priced for what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is in the lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just touch over a hundred and it does
some serious filtering.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can bring air from outside into
your grow essentially if you filter it
[SPEAKER_09]: with that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's worth a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a gigantic K&N air filter
for a freaking F-22 Raptor or some shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_09]: God, imagine when you're done with that
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go dump it in the fucking,
oops, $5.
[SPEAKER_09]: You dump it in the fucking landfill.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not doing that anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just called it was over.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go dump it in the landfill and you set
it down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just picturing some sort of Breaking
Bad desert is where I was watching
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody in my mind dump it and throws it
down in the desert and all these bugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, imagine all the crazy shit
that's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you got a blower attached to it
sucking every bug that flies by is going
[SPEAKER_09]: to go and just get sucked into that and
get stuck in your trap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're coming for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Biological warfare.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're coming for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try to, I've got like three
more pages of stuff typed out and I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: going to have to edit out the F word.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to have to finish the show
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should leave just that part in though.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll leave the F word in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done with paying $5 for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I already declared that earlier in the
show.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just so daydreaming and thinking
about like, where would this thing,
[SPEAKER_09]: cause you can't like, boy, I wasn't
picturing me and you doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm picturing like some shady grower with
this big gigantic vent cleaner and he's
[SPEAKER_09]: just rolling it out of the back of his
truck in the desert somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just like, Oh, imagine what comes
out of that, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hair, bugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be anything pretty.
[SPEAKER_09]: All kinds of weird molds and danders and
pollens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so gross.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was one thing when I was
actually researching it before we got it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, this will be great for
protection from outdoor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amateurs outdoor amateur pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I've got a male that might blow soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just reminded me that I did not move it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's in a spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: If he goes, I don't want that to happen
premature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's in, yeah, I don't need him to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's in a bad spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So guys, uh, we've been ranting here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to try to get back on track
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got 15 more minutes or so before
everyone's going to get ADD kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: already happened to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, since we've got ducting in place,
let's hang up some lights guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this room, we have an eight by eight
footprint and four lights.
[SPEAKER_09]: That means we can use a four by four area
for each light.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be bright in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_09]: Divide the room into perfect quarters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Find the center for each quarter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang your lights.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're centered in the corners or the
quarters, not corners.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want them centered in the quarters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so basically you got a four by four
section with the light perfectly above it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every four by four space has a light
right above it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse's doing math on how many lumens and
how many watts per square foot that is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could do 600 while lights in the
setup.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted thousands of the way to go
in here, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my professional opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got the electricity and you're
building this room, put thousands in
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use those little, uh, 64 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously that's simple math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm all stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work at calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always divide things the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 62, uh, watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what would be your recommendation,
Mr. Hydro Shop expert?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a really healthy lot,
uh, per square foot.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be a healthy room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey Ryan, you've got a room kind of like
this dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: So good job.
[SPEAKER_09]: You might've taken some advice from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no Tierra Rojo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 120 watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that indoor acre.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're talking about a spot called the
indoor acre is what is, that place is
[SPEAKER_09]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a mile and a half of plumbing
in there just for the hydro kit.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're hanging our lights.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in the corner, the core,
the center of the quarters of the room,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be a lot of editing on the
show guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like to use those little eye hooks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I sell at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just, uh, screws with a little
circle at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically screw that into the ceiling,
uh, screw it directly into the ceiling
[SPEAKER_09]: beams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you hit a stud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there will only be studs there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can have mylar or a stud or a
plastic or a stud.
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you get it in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a bedroom though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot about the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got a quick trick for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps you center your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take two eight foot, uh, two by fours,
screw them to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you push your lights anywhere you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always know you hit a stud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to do that in one, one area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a place where the lights were,
um, I worked for two companies in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: building, ironically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and at the first company I didn't help
set anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and all of the lights were hung from a
floating grid ceiling, big old Raptor
[SPEAKER_00]: hoods, uh, with little tiny plastic hooks
is absolutely like just super dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: dumb ass move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, when I went to work for the
other company, I got paid to do a two by
[SPEAKER_00]: four structure all through that,
uh, could support a couple of gorillas.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, guys be safe when you're
building stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about not being that asshole
that burns down the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also don't be the guy that takes down the
bedroom on accident.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're renting, you're going to have to
pay for whatever you mess up.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I like those little light hangers to
hang my lights.
[SPEAKER_09]: The ratchet style ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, hang all four lights, screw in your
bulbs and wipe off the bulbs when you're
[SPEAKER_09]: done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, wipe them off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to use like a, uh, it's a thing
that you should be cleaning your drums
[SPEAKER_09]: with.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little soft, uh, it's like a
microfiber.
[SPEAKER_09]: Clean it off with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunglass stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunglass stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want any scratches in that,
uh, in the bulb or any dust or dirt on
[SPEAKER_09]: there or any oil from your finger on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any little thing that close to the bulb is
going to definitely kill lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your bulb is screwed in
completely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of your connections are all pushed
in tight on your ballast as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So screwing your bulbs, wipe it off,
make sure it's tight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, run the ducting from the blower to the
Y duct to each light back to the other Y
[SPEAKER_09]: out of your grow room and then secure all
of those ductings with tape.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be a lot of pressure on
the ducts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, an eight inch blower puts out a lot of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be a good idea also to grab a fan
speed controller.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you plug that in and then you plug
your fan into that and you can actually,
[SPEAKER_09]: your blower, your eight inch vortex
blower, you can adjust how much by
[SPEAKER_09]: percentage of from, it only works about
50%.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's as low as I think it goes,
but then you can go from 50 all the way to
[SPEAKER_09]: a hundred.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, if you're wanting to keep a little
humidity in the room, turn it down.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get it down to, you know,
50% humidity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn it down to 70%.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually how I run it in one space
at about 70% all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the can fans come with the
little three-speed switch on the cord.
[SPEAKER_09]: Already adjusted to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that may be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hyper fan, the best fan on the
market, in my opinion, it comes with one
[SPEAKER_00]: built in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, see that's a new product for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I upgrade, it's time for some of
those.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we've got ducting, you got lights
on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of starting to look like a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you got to hang a couple fans on the
walls.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would put fans, uh, right above the
expected height of your plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you, you think your plants are
going to get five feet tall, put a fan at
[SPEAKER_09]: five and a half feet, uh, right between
the fan can or the light canopy with a
[SPEAKER_09]: damn lot of words, right between the plant
canopy and the lights is kind of where I
[SPEAKER_09]: like a fan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep the air moving.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you don't want the air to get stale.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plants suck up the CO2 in the room
quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can use the CO2 around them super
quickly and you just got to move the air.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's more CO2 for them to use up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're 51 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you throw maybe a box fan on the
floor?
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like a box fan on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super low speed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if you're on a budget, the box fan is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have more of a budget, I would
recommend a carbon filter with like a six
[SPEAKER_09]: inch blower on top of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just dead sitting in the center of the
room, put some ducting off the blower up
[SPEAKER_09]: to the ceiling and just move that air from
the floor back up to the ceiling and
[SPEAKER_09]: you're picking up CO2 off the ground and
putting it back up to fall back down onto
[SPEAKER_09]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just differences in budgets.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got a low, but if you've got 30
bucks by a fan, if you've got 160 by a
[SPEAKER_09]: blower and a filter, just kind of,
or I guess it's going to be closer to 260.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that blower is going to be 120,
130.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your filters are going to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, uh, I've watched everything
escalate in price.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, since I've been expanding my grows and
since Colorado has been getting more
[SPEAKER_09]: popular, everything has just gone up in
price and it's not even a competitive
[SPEAKER_09]: raise.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a gouging raise.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, man, remember buying a light in
like 2002 and keeping your head down at
[SPEAKER_09]: the store, trying not to be noticed,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear I paid like five, 600 bucks for my
first light setup and it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic, uh, 400 watt, like nothing
special whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but everything else I feel like has
gotten more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, lighting is the only, only thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I guess it's just because
there's so many newer options,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basic lighting, I feel like it's
gotten cheaper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And more reliable.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember you would, you'd buy shit and
then it would just die on you and it seems
[SPEAKER_09]: to last at least a year or two.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it, if it doesn't, you can take it
back.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've gone 52 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: My next part is all about hanging up the
ballast and electronics and making the
[SPEAKER_09]: board that I like to hang my stuff on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm going to leave everybody
hanging and we're going to do that part of
[SPEAKER_09]: the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a trick to help you take better
pictures when you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jesse's going to help us out with some
tricks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, when can you come back and do another
episode, bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we'll try to get him back for part
three of our growing, our building our
[SPEAKER_09]: grow room episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give a huge, huge,
super huge shout out to Hygro and our
[SPEAKER_09]: growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Jesse's here, so I'm kissing his
ass a little bit, but seriously,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, they helped me out a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: They sponsored this show and without them,
I couldn't do some of the things that I
[SPEAKER_09]: do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any idea when the next growers
meeting is going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm really bad with dates,
but I know when it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's one of those guys that can build you
a freaking farm in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you give him math or a calendar,
he just gets all this like look on his
[SPEAKER_09]: face of like, can I hit it with a hammer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually great with math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't ever do my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a new phone, so.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's stepped up into the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's looking through his phone to find
out when the next next growers meeting is.
[SPEAKER_09]: At Hygro and our growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We gather at the back of the shop and we
talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be Friday the 21st,
Friday the 21st of October.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: November November because we can't go back
in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's my favorite movie ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the future trilogy.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, guys, I'm going to have to get
free that day no matter what happens
[SPEAKER_09]: because you guys are all going to come say
the date again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, November 21st, November 21st.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Friday at Hygro and our growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: About six, six fifteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it four to eight last time and kind
of decided the two hours when we were open
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of lame, so.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little hint there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying anything, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, we're going to have barbecue
pork.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were thinking about doing turkey,
but everyone's going to have plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be that asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to have some good smoked
pork from probably my dad will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been smoking meat for many years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse's dad is a cool son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am going to get a awesome vegetarian
option too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for people who need to eat their
damn veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone eat your veggies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat your vegetables, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a vegetarian for, oh my God,
over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember exactly when.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I was a vegetarian in 2002.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I can't remember before that when I
started, but there was an event that
[SPEAKER_09]: happened and one of my friends I hadn't
seen in a while made fun of me for being a
[SPEAKER_09]: vegetarian at Bonnaroo.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first Bonnaroo was 2002.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been a vegetarian since then.
[SPEAKER_09]: And since I started eating better,
I try to eat a little better and better
[SPEAKER_09]: and better all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the more I take care of my body,
the better I feel.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_09]: So eat your vegetables, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a, that's a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't eat as much meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even if you eat meat,
America eats way, way too much of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And try to eat food.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quit eating like food product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like processed shit that kind of resembles
food.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want food.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's got like 17 ingredients in it,
that's not food anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fewer ingredients and the easier they
are to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All those eukdoses and extoses and
oodlamates.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of that shit is good for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of rambling now.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about we wrap up a podcast and we'll
look forward to talking to you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: In about seven days.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the end?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got that thing I read at the end of
the show and I can't find it, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to ad lib.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I saw it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the paper I need.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, don't forget to follow Jesse on
Instagram and Twitter.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an awesome strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some Yeti in middle of week five and
it is fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite new strain that I got
my hands on this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't run the glue yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting close to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got them next to each other in a
row.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's cookies, Yeti, sour diesel,
grateful dog, two gorilla glues and then
[SPEAKER_09]: two platinum OGs all in a row.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's like my stellar row.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, Ooh, let's see what these girls
do next to each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all getting fed the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all under the same two lights.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what they do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're in seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just recently I got to Chuck Pollen,
took a grateful dog male and threw his
[SPEAKER_09]: pollen all over a bunch of sexy ladies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So about January nature's green remedies
will be stocked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guys and gals that have left comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher and every episode is
[SPEAKER_09]: available on iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I have been slacking off on putting
videos on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will catch up pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been having too much fun lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to Garden of the Gods with my
friend and had a great time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just enjoyed life for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get back on track.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to send an extra special thanks to
Jesse for coming to all these episodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's getting good at it, isn't he guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell he's so much more comfortable
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sit in here like Larry King with a
pin in my hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get you some suspenders, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hijack my dad's closet.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a fad dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for episode number 40 of the I
Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me at the table again is our good
buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast land.
[SPEAKER_09]: Podcast land, internet world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully you guys are listening to us
while you're driving to work or playing in
[SPEAKER_09]: the garden or doing something fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you're doing, I hope you got a
dab or a fat joint or a bowl of something
[SPEAKER_09]: super dank.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're smoking some live resin,
some bounty killer, or no, not bounty
[SPEAKER_09]: killer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it is bounty killer live resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Capleton live resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just lied.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Capleton live resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: This stuff is tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good big shout out to the dude that grew
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And an extra special shout out to the guy
that blasted, extracted it for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: This stuff is super tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would imagine that the iry genetics
guy would have all those iry genetics dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting over there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it's really nice to see- Can't even
keep them straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really nice to watch my friends grow
my genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then to have one of our good brothers
extract it for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he gets his hash back and he
calls me, dude, come over and get some of
[SPEAKER_09]: this hash I just had made from your
strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, hell yeah, I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a nice gram of heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was grateful dog and there was
Capleton live resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And dude, that was tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It left a, I keep saying citronella
candles sort of scent in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're into that, that was a great
smell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, I want to take one quick second and
give a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always do this at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we got to do a special shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Extra special shout out to my ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spence has been sick as hell.
[SPEAKER_09]: We found out just recently that his
appendix had ruptured inside of him and he
[SPEAKER_09]: had to have it removed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I'm so glad you're on the way to
recovery.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were super worried about you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was stressing out, worried about my
brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you more than you ever will
realize.
[SPEAKER_09]: So big shout out to Spence, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody send your love and energy to
getting Spence better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get better, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, feller.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, buddy, get up.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to shoot some hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to make some hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spence is going to win the series.
[SPEAKER_09]: Secret cup finals in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus an appendix.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can he fly cheaper?
[SPEAKER_09]: He just lost some weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't your appendix only like about an
inch long anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually looked it up today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing almost killed him.
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost killed him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure he was pretty bad shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost, it's completely
worthless.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody asked me, what does your appendix
do?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I looked at him and said, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's full of a poison vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it does.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just stick this inside of a human
and wait for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to interrupt you one day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the self-destruct switch he gave
us, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, since we're sending out love and
energy to people that need some help,
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to send a big, huge healing vibe to
my good friend, Angela.
[SPEAKER_09]: She hasn't been feeling well the past
week.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's got some medical things going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of private to her,
so we don't need to elaborate.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, dude, send a lot of healing vibes to
Angela.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_09]: Care a lot about you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you better.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see you smiling again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to jump in and do a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I played this shout out for Angela,
and when she heard it, she said that I
[SPEAKER_09]: made it sound like there's something wrong
with her vagina.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to assure you, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with Angela's vagina.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get back to the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's get off the somber vibe and
get into a show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do owe another shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two more shout outs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I owe a shout out to the man,
Afro Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to hang out with this dude,
Afro Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: He sings that song, Because I Got High.
[SPEAKER_09]: He played a show in a town near me.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little VIP party at a dispensary
called The Spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to The Spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Robert?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Vegas?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you guys are listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to everyone at The Spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got me to see Afro Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got a couple of photos with Afro Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually Angela's fault.
[SPEAKER_09]: She works there.
[SPEAKER_09]: She got me the little VIP hookup.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks again, Angela.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I walked in and Afro Man was taking
pictures with people and doing a little
[SPEAKER_09]: quick private meet and greet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he saw me and he goes, oh,
shit, come here, my man.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he took pictures with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: He posted my photos up on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he blew off a lot of people to come
hang out with Rasta Jeff for some reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: The owners of The Spot said that he could
come smoke with me, but he probably would
[SPEAKER_09]: not make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: To his show.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he opted to not smoke with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like, you look like you might
murder me with some smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, he didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then you're also, yeah,
at a dispensary and unfortunately not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to smoke in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_09]: They totally knew I was going to drive him
off in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had you just been able to hand him a joint
would have been a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, he did do a show in Colorado
Springs after that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can't talk about what happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about a couple of other
things too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout outs are done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to everybody that's listening to
the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, this is episode 40.
[SPEAKER_09]: We made it 40 episodes, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is getting good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise you guys, the episodes are
getting better.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been doing more preparation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been doing more planning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got the next few episode topics
already listed of what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming up in a couple of episodes,
we're going to do an episode about
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had a couple of people ask me,
tell me about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is all this NPK 539 on my bottles?
[SPEAKER_09]: What does this shit mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: What should I be feeding?
[SPEAKER_09]: What do I need?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to cover that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also our friend, Ross Cola,
King Cola, Sean is going to come be on the
[SPEAKER_09]: show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't called him yet, but he did send
me his phone number.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got his phone number so I could text
him and ask him to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: He hypes a growing system that he has
labeled organic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm kind of impressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been growing for quite a while and he
has the approach that I hope to get to.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not where he is yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got a very environmentally friendly,
environmentally sustainable way of
[SPEAKER_09]: growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm impressed and it takes a little bit to
impress me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does these fermentations that look
delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I would almost, if I didn't know
what was in there, some of that stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: would look tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they really do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it smells good because of the
molasses.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let Sean tell you about his stuff
when we get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to Ross Cola, King Cola and
organic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get him on here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And guys, I'm saying that for,
but it doesn't cost money anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm actually quoting this guy's brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he can't charge me on that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something he can charge me for.

Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out the Denver store at 6271 Beech
Street or the Pueblo location,
[SPEAKER_09]: 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any deals this month,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still got the roots, 707 for 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mentioned the iGrow Culture podcast for
commercial pricing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went there today and she had no problem
typing in commercial pricing for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got myself a bag of soil for my
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, can I tell them what they'll pay for
that bag of, what did I get there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Light Warrior?
[SPEAKER_09]: That bag was less than 18 bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was $17 and some change for that bag.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually that's a $25 bag of dirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I saved eight bucks just by telling
them, hey, I listened to the iGrow Culture
[SPEAKER_09]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: So go get yourself a bag of soil,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't even, you know, when you get a
discount, some places they act like you're
[SPEAKER_09]: a dick.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like, don't I owe you pricing?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You do give me a deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you tell them that you're
listening to the iGrow Culture podcast and
[SPEAKER_09]: also check out their website, hygrodenver
.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't write it down because I thought I
remembered and apparently I just forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hygrodenver.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we also have hygro.us.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also have Hygro Pueblo has a
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in Pueblo and you want to team
up on their Facebook, check it out because
[SPEAKER_09]: they post a lot of cool stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting around to using it a little more.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to keep up with all the social
media, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially like, I don't know how to
Instagram being a shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take pictures of products in the front of
the store.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start doing some cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ordered a grow tent for the store.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can set that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show how to work it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some stuff going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then we've got the next growers
meeting next Friday, I believe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Friday the 21st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: The 21st.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the day after my mama's birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: So happy birthday, mama.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't listen to the podcast,
but whatever, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the thought that counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some a bunch of supply or freebies
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have some.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I got hooked up last time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a couple of little gifts last time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go over cloning and
seeding in person.
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be really helpful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beans and houseplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get your hopes up too much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, are you able to,
can we clone a cannabis plant in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we could just take a plant that looks
just like cannabis and teach them how to
[SPEAKER_09]: do it in the work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We like that hydro shop, so let's not risk
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I go to get my gear for
cheap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also guys, this podcast is brought to you
by our friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: Treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone asks me, what is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go look at it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mostly concert and festival news.
[SPEAKER_09]: Festival news and reviews is what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: They talk about all the concerts that come
to Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you listen to stuff like the string
cheese, fish, Galactic, the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_09]: Sound Tribe Sector 9, the disco biscuits,
even if you're into like Boombox and
[SPEAKER_09]: Bassnecker is who I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more of a fish, Grateful Dead,
reggae kind of a kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I check it out because I want to know
when fish is coming and what the cheese is
[SPEAKER_09]: up to.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So treethugger.com will keep you up to
date with all of your hippie news.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to say, look out at the cookout
with treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you say string cheese incident,
I think of Richard Cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great band.
[SPEAKER_09]: Richard Cheese.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys haven't listened to Richard
Cheese, he does popular songs in a lounge
[SPEAKER_09]: style.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some Rage Against the Machine,
all big band style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lounge against the machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lounge against the machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually I would take this time to read
comments on Facebook or on Stitcher and
[SPEAKER_09]: iTunes, but I haven't got any new
comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big thanks to the people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh God, sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got loud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big thanks to the people that did leave
comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to leave some comments on
iTunes and Stitcher, I will read them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also check out the comments on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an Instagram page, but like Jesse
said, I don't Instagram a lot because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: a podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take pictures of Jesse and me and I
can post them up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, not a lot to post.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to talk more about,
I want to make sure I covered all the
[SPEAKER_09]: intro stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place to leave questions
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at every now and then, make sure
there's no, you know, on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I try so hard to answer all of the
questions I get.
[SPEAKER_09]: Since they shut down, Facebook shut down
the iRegenetics Facebook page and took it
[SPEAKER_09]: from an interactive page and made it to
just a business page, which I find boring.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've gotten a lot of spare time to
check Instagram and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_09]: lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really mess around that much on
those Facebooks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do check them to answer your questions,
but I don't really play there like I used
[SPEAKER_09]: to.
[SPEAKER_09]: They kind of pissed me off taking my page
down like that without even talking to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dicks.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been doing grow lessons,
teaching you guys, we're trying to sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: stoner style teach you guys how to set up
a grow room for yourself so that you can
[SPEAKER_09]: be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've gotten the room built.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about the best places to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We gave you a good guide.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far we've got a room built with lights
hanging, but we haven't hung our ballasts
[SPEAKER_09]: yet and our timers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of where we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys need to catch up, I'll take a
pause and you can go listen to the two
[SPEAKER_09]: episodes before this and you can catch up
to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're back now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you listen to those and learn the
whole shit time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't really pause that long.
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have paused longer because I need
a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another chance.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, editing is fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even edit these shows anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just put them out the way they go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's way better when we're just high doing
our thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got these big, this big 10 by
eight by eight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We built an eight by eight room.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got your poly wrapped.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're around everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all sealed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got your lights hanging.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now what I would like to do is show you
the, not show you, tell you the way I hang
[SPEAKER_09]: my ballasts and my electronics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jesse and I have a lot of different
ideas, so those will get fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use a piece of plywood to mount all of
the electronics in one area.
[SPEAKER_09]: At Lowe's or whatever hardware store,
they actually sell a pre-cut board.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's 24, it may be 18 inches by 36
inches.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can screw that right onto the wall and
you can hang, I can fit four, I can fit
[SPEAKER_09]: five ballasts and my power box on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so all of the ballasts are plugged in
to the power box and it's also screwed to
[SPEAKER_09]: the board.
[SPEAKER_09]: I screwed the board to the framing on the
outside of the grill room to keep the heat
[SPEAKER_09]: down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse was talking about, if you put it on
the inside, keep it close to the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: The outside is ideal because if something
goes wrong, you don't have to go in there
[SPEAKER_09]: to turn everything off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also keep a fire extinguisher near that
box.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that I recommend.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to have to run into the
grill room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep a smoke alarm in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If there is a fire, you don't want to have
to go halfway through the room to get to
[SPEAKER_09]: your fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to have it outside, kick the door
open and start spraying and put out fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's your biggest fear.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you got to be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you got this board, you got four
ballasts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put a power box on there because that's
how I plug everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's screwed to the wall.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like those power boxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really reliable.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I buy them straight up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Made in America.
[SPEAKER_09]: Made in America, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to ask you, here's a random
side note.
[SPEAKER_09]: What ballasts are made in America?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I can find out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can Google that while I read on for a
second.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost time for me to buy several.
[SPEAKER_09]: more ballasts and I would like to buy
American made products because I noticed
[SPEAKER_09]: that the, what the hell brand is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: The quantums that used to be made in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they come with a made in China or a
made in Korea sticker on them and they
[SPEAKER_09]: smell funny now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also I've noticed that the fans don't
last as long.
[SPEAKER_09]: They start shitting out really quickly
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't want to buy those anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those used to be my go-tos because they
don't fail like a next gen does.
[SPEAKER_09]: A next gen will just shit out on you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll try to start up and fail just
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't start properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to actually have a 400
watt next gen right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm using, I have a 400.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to replace my 400 watt next gen
because it took a shit on me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm running a 600 in that room now just
because I don't want to go buy that 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, we were trying to,
they're kind of hard to find nowadays.
[SPEAKER_09]: The 400?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's going bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to keep my males under a 400 in
flower just because you can just keep them
[SPEAKER_09]: flowering and you don't need to run all
that much light.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're just doing a phenol hunt for
boys, how many people phenol hunt for
[SPEAKER_09]: males?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're phenol hunting for males,
you're probably not listening to this
[SPEAKER_09]: show.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're beyond everything we've said so
far.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be hanging out at the table
right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're phenol hunting for males,
you're invited.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll find you.
[SPEAKER_09]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just strategizing about that very
subject.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, can we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm iRegenetics of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Rasta Jeff from iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a runner in iRegenetics for a
couple of few years now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been public.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeds have been available.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot keep up with the demand for my
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got enough breeding space to breed
plenty of seeds, but when they go on sale
[SPEAKER_09]: at Nature's Green Remedies, they sell out
in like 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our good buddy Jesse has stepped up to the
plate.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to run a bunch of his shit as
soon as it's done.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I see that his stuff does good,
we're going to add him to our lineup.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll be part of team iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll be another breeder.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll be our second breeder.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripod Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripod Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited to get him in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But pretty soon, stuff that Jesse bred
will be available through the iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_09]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some chem dog stuff coming and some OG
flavorful stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the teas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the teas.
[SPEAKER_09]: On Halloween, I put Grateful Dog pollen on
a Platinum OG female and on a Sour Diesel
[SPEAKER_09]: female, and I've never pollinated those
with the Grateful Dog before, so we'll
[SPEAKER_09]: have Platinum Dog.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sour Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that same Sour you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about throwing that out
there, you know, dusting him up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it because that's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's snanky.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't grow with the vigor that I
want on a hardier, thicker plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Top it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Top the shit out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got good yield for a plant that
normally exhibits that trait though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And flower her early because man,
that thing takes off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I learn the hard way?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't keep up with Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_09]: My Gorilla Glue has tripled in size since
I started flowering.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you find me an American-made ballast?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not finding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suspect the Galaxies are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Sunlight, a lot of their products
are made in America, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys have an idea of a good
American-made ballast, let me know because
[SPEAKER_09]: it's for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm shopping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think I know of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really expensive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gavitas or the… No, those would be
made in Holland.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the Gavitas competitor?
[SPEAKER_09]: The EPAPs?
[SPEAKER_00]: EPAPs, I believe those are China.
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are the NanoLux DEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know those are made in China.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are Lush Lights made in America?
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if Lush Lights are made in
America or if they're made in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suspect they're made in… I'd
really hope they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Solistek, made in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to check out guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solistek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was one of the weirdest
endorsements I ever saw in my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: They recommend these ballasts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shouldn't a breeder or somebody endorse
that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that maybe the Horderlux makes
ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe their stuff's made in
America.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to buy American-made ballasts guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I encourage you to also.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I take this board that I bought at
Lowe's and I put the board on the floor
[SPEAKER_09]: and I mount my ballast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't screw it to the floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I set it on the floor so I can work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I set the board on the floor and then I
screw the ballasts to the board and then I
[SPEAKER_09]: screw my power box to the board.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now this board is movable.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can hang your ballast damn near
anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bolt that to where it's convenient for
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's outside of the room is what I
would prefer because then you're keeping
[SPEAKER_09]: heat out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those ballasts get hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it outside of the room and then you can
mess with your timers and stuff and not be
[SPEAKER_09]: in the room so that it's just easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: So bolt that wherever you need,
screw that wherever you need the framing,
[SPEAKER_09]: then run that wiring through a small hole
in the pallet and tape over it to keep the
[SPEAKER_09]: light from leaking.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you've got air in, air out,
lights and power.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're probably going to need to cool down
the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: An air conditioner is definitely what
you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may need a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_09]: So take another small board and put your
air conditioner thermostat on there if you
[SPEAKER_09]: have one that doesn't attach to the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can plug your air conditioner into a
temperature sensor and hang that on the
[SPEAKER_09]: wall.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when the temperature gets to a
certain thing, to the certain temperature,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can set the day and night temperature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that little meter will tell the
air conditioner when to come on and when
[SPEAKER_09]: to go off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can do that with almost any piece
of equipment in your room.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can automate your dehumidifier,
your air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can automate your fans.
[SPEAKER_09]: In one room, I've got an emergency
shutdown switch.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it hits over 95 degrees in that room,
everything turns off, everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even the air conditioners because I don't
know what's causing the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything just shuts off and the
ambient temps are only going to be 70
[SPEAKER_09]: something in that area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, there's no light.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put all your automation stuff on one board
and put that where it's visible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put a thermometer, a hygrometer on there,
all this stuff that you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_09]: see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes that has to be inside the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So put that in the room if you have to.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want that outside of the room,
it'll be more expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that one will probably have to go in
the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just put all your stuff onto one board
and nail it to one spot up high where you
[SPEAKER_09]: can see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: A random side note, when you're building a
grow room and you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_09]: planning a grow room, think of water goes
low, electrical goes high.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want your water low on the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a bucket, if you've got a
reservoir, there's no need to lift that up
[SPEAKER_09]: off the ground too high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it low because if it does topple
over, you don't want it to spill on your
[SPEAKER_09]: electronics, which should be kept above
waist high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't run conduit along the wall lower
than about 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my waist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually believe that's code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: But these guys, they're just building
rooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water low, electricity high because you
don't want to pour water in your
[SPEAKER_09]: electricity ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep your cords organized, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen so many messes of grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them as short as possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of tipped.
[SPEAKER_09]: It got impotent on us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put a smoke alarm and fire detector where
you can get to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: The smoke alarm in the room, the fire
detector outside of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are little side notes that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to need air conditioning
is what I wrote down next.
[SPEAKER_09]: I follow the general rule of 3,000 BTUs of
air conditioning per 1,000 watt light.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to use those traditional ACs
you can put in the window, that do go in a
[SPEAKER_09]: window, you can cut a hole in the poly and
mount the AC to the framing, but that's
[SPEAKER_09]: going to heat up whatever room you dumped
the AC exhaust into.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in a garage or an unused
basement, that's cool, but you can't heat
[SPEAKER_09]: up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to go somewhere or it's just
going to continue to heat up.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people run it straight through
the chimney if you got one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen it go into the attic if you need
to.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys are in illegal states,
you're going to have to plan this a little
[SPEAKER_09]: better because your heat signature is what
they're going to look for to bust you,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard they have to have a warrant for
that, but I'm no lawyer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also 2014, almost 15, where the cops
can do just about whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are living in a police state.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll just fly over with that camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll say, oh look, all that bright
light, and then they'll just send a car to
[SPEAKER_09]: go sit in front of your house and then
they'll notice some shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cops are the worst gang that we have
nowadays, the worst criminals on the damn
[SPEAKER_00]: streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the air conditioners, if it's going to
outside, a lot of them, if the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner is in your room and it's in an
outside window,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to get out of your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get out of your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops the light from coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked that up from Subcool actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't brag about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I posted a really sweet picture to
Instagram the other day, and Subcool
[SPEAKER_09]: actually sent me a message that said we
should collab.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the future, there could be some TGA,
irie, genetic stuff happening,
[SPEAKER_09]: but right now I'm going to focus on what
I'm doing with Jesse because I know that's
[SPEAKER_09]: for real and I know I can trust Jesse.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anybody else out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really honored for that too.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like the first person I thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, I had something else I wanted to say
before we got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black spray paint on the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keeping light out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_09]: They take more energy, but I like those
air conditioners on wheels.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a little duct.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just duct it right out of a six
inch duct.
[SPEAKER_09]: It works perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are glorious.
[SPEAKER_09]: They take a little more electricity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you need maybe a fan speed
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are always helpful.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always a reason to add a fan speed
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a little thermostat thing to turn
off my air cool fans when it gets too cold
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked out to the room the other day and
there's 4,000 watt lights burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally it's 70 to 68 degrees in there
and it was like 55 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shut all the fans off, everything,
and it took most of the light cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat back up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm loving this wind.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was negative six degrees here the other
night where we live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: My air conditioners aren't on in any of my
grows right now and I'm confident that
[SPEAKER_09]: that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've turned all of the air conditioners
off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just let that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're saving some electricity right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of electricity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heat with wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through an insane amount of
firewood in the last three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably three, 400 pounds shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You build your rooms to where they're ...
You build your grows to where they're a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of work.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm that guy that automates as much as I
can so that I do not- Oh, I'll just talk
[SPEAKER_09]: about my house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, just the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't automate any of my waterings.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel that I need to be in there watering
the plants by hand myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I tell myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I touch them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I move every pot when I water.
[SPEAKER_09]: I touch every plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at ... I'll pull off a leaf off of
almost every plant and look at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_09]: look for a bug.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm anal in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a ritual that I go through in
there every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't bug me until this is done or
everything will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to love this room, but I automate
almost everything else I can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, your light cycles, your air
conditioning, your depletion of fire,
[SPEAKER_09]: your CO2, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: The new rules that they're trying to
propose here in Pueblo, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_09]: they want to ban CO2 augmentation.
What?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the stupid things they wrote
in the rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk about that more in the future,
but that just came up in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo, Pueblo, Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Clown shoes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Clown shoes, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size 55, triple E.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that made sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just mounted the ballast right to a
board, then we put the board right up on
[SPEAKER_09]: the wall, and then you got to run all the
cables.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the part I skipped.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure when you push the cables
together, make sure you push them tight.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the way tight because when that shit's
loose, that's electricity that's live
[SPEAKER_09]: right there just being exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bend them all up, but out of wire,
but I do a safety wire too to hold it all
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was in bands, I learned to tie
cords that are connected together in that
[SPEAKER_09]: knot, where if you pull instead,
it tightens the knot instead of them
[SPEAKER_09]: coming apart.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that move a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to be a roadie and a musician.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the 70s, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about a tip on pictures,
and since we're talking about running
[SPEAKER_00]: cords, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cord that runs from the ballast to the
light is what causes all the bars in your
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shorter those are and the neater
they're hung and everything, the less bars
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit you'll have coming up on some
cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the magnetic that causes
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really care about it when I set
up my new room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you keep all the cords away
from each other too, individually instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of tied together on the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes sense because you get way more
of that signal all at once.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would make sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote down so much stuff on so many
different papers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for them all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Too many different things on too many
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks way professional.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Howard Stern.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I get sued for that?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like his fucking trademark,
huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Screw that guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Howard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't mean to steal your trademark.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was flattery is what that was.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got this room mostly figured out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got lights hung.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got all of our automation set up
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got air going in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got air going out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that you got most of everything set
up, you got your pond liner on the floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would add four, four by four tables.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use, and I don't want to say brands,
but I use the Hydra.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hydra Farm four by four white flood tables
because they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to raise them up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the white botanic care trays.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find someone to make you a stand
for them or you can put them on buckets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those tables that they sell are so damn
expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't buy the tables that are prefab
unless you're looking to look like you got
[SPEAKER_09]: a pro in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just straight up Hydra store guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those tables are bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could kick one over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say the big foot table is
just stuck together with little plastic
[SPEAKER_09]: pegs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can fall over so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I like the tables and the
trays, I like to get the plants up off the
[SPEAKER_09]: ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: The floor gets too cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you lift them up off the ground,
you get a more regulated temperature.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like you can get a little more air
flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm six foot five, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having plants down on the ground,
I have to get on my knee to get down to
[SPEAKER_09]: the soil to see what's happening at the
soil level or the bottom foliage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lifting them up off the ground two feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they're in my face.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're right where I want them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to squat all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that better too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see a lot more of what's going
on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know this way more.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on how much space you have and
how big a plant you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're growing seven gallon pots and
you're putting them on a table,
[SPEAKER_09]: now you're going to have a seven foot tall
plant maybe by the end, so you got a plant
[SPEAKER_09]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the four by four tables, you can fit
four seven gallon pots or nine or 12 three
[SPEAKER_09]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're perfect for one light worth of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in a legal state and you got the
numbers and you're going to do hydro,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can do 64, those little six inch rock
wall cubes and just put a clone in there
[SPEAKER_09]: and veg them for like a week and flower in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I've seen people pull a pound and a
half off of 64 little clones, veg for a
[SPEAKER_09]: week and a half on a table like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 64 little nooks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: They weighed about seven grams each or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cali connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally how Swerve does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recipe to success or whatever he calls
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fast track to success.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Swerve.
[SPEAKER_09]: What up, Swerve?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't heard much from that guy
in a while.
[SPEAKER_09]: Social media kind of killed everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Facebook Nazi police went and made
everybody use our real names.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now when I scroll through, I don't even
know anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you pull that off, dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the trick, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are a drag queen, and I know that's
not the appropriate word, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_09]: the appropriate word anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not politically correct in the drag
queen scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my cousin's one.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a drag queen, you can email
Facebook and say, I'm a drag queen and
[SPEAKER_09]: this is my alter ego.
[SPEAKER_09]: They will allow you to use your fake name.
[SPEAKER_09]: That probably won't work anymore after a
couple of days that this show is out and
[SPEAKER_09]: people try it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why a lot of the people in the
cannabis community, handmade, they're
[SPEAKER_09]: still Richard or they're still handmade
instead of Adam Hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people got to keep their shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's random.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a bunch of drag queens that like to
know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all had to put their real names up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because now instead of being Simone
LaRue, it's Michael Witt.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not Witt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to try.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know who your dad is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I should shut my mouth.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Mr. Witt?
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope to see you at the Grover's meeting
November 21st at Hygro and Door Growing
[SPEAKER_09]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rasta Jeff will be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also that night, here's a random plug.
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Rogan's new comedy special comes out
on Comedy Central the night of the 21st at
[SPEAKER_09]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to leave Hygro and Door
Growing Supplies and I'm going to come
[SPEAKER_09]: home and I'm going to get super dabbed out
and I'm going to watch the Joe Rogan
[SPEAKER_09]: special because I was there at ComedyWorks
when that shit was recorded and I want to
[SPEAKER_09]: see if they show my high ass on that
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, I'm going to have to watch it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're totally off topic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, but have fun with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were seating us for the Joe Rogan
experience or the recording of his live
[SPEAKER_09]: show and there were cameras all over
ComedyWorks and they put me and my crew,
[SPEAKER_09]: there was me and my date and one of our
good friends and we all had dreadlocks and
[SPEAKER_09]: they put us in about row eight where no
one can see us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're like, yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then they would bring in normal
looking people and set them in rows three
[SPEAKER_09]: and four.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then if a guy came in with a good
looking girl, like there was a girl that
[SPEAKER_09]: came in and I'm not even being a dick.
[SPEAKER_09]: She had her boobies hanging out.
[SPEAKER_09]: She was wearing like a peach colored
shirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: She was all tan and had her hair all done.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I looked at my date and I go front
row, watch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they got two people out of the front
row.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, you guys have to move.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they put her and her date front row in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were just doing it for TV.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just pretty people up front.
[SPEAKER_09]: They put me under a camera so that there
was no chance of that camera getting me.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was cool because I was the camera
that Joe was looking directly into the
[SPEAKER_09]: whole recording.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a camera like about 20 rows back
from the stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: They only did about half the comedy club
full that night.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I'm way ranting, but I had so
much fun seeing Joe.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was stressful being in a taping.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all, they ask you for your phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like comedy works wants to take your phone
from you so that it doesn't ring or go off
[SPEAKER_09]: during the taping.
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanted, they wouldn't let you wear a
hat.
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanted me to cover up my irie
genetics logo on my shirt, but I didn't do
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did not want logos.
[SPEAKER_09]: They definitely put the three dreadlocked
hippies out of camera sight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half dreadlock, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're calling Adam as the half dread,
if you're curious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Angela, you count as a full dread,
sweetie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard Michael make that joke the other
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, he's getting there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're tightening up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Adam?
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to be listening to this show
probably Monday morning when it comes out
[SPEAKER_09]: at work.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you get to go to work today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Snow has wrecked everybody's work week.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been snowing for days here,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the only one with a four wheel drive
vehicle that's reliable right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been playing, I'm not going to say
taxi because I don't mind doing it,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's been nice helping all my friends
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're stuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you a ride.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you a ride.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you a ride.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled a chick and her little boyfriend
out the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a gigantic truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's not one of those diesel
fucking penile issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very functional.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not classy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a chick getting truck.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a working man's damn truck.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can deliver soil anywhere in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or anywhere in Colorado in that truck.
[SPEAKER_09]: The top of Pike's Peak.
[SPEAKER_09]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be driving around like Ken Block.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how it is around here right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just slushy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go slow.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys will be cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like nobody's driven in the snow
before.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've done this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a year ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even that.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, guys, we're going to get back
onto building a grow room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of ranting here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had some dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're building a hydro hut,
that's very similar to this setup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd run the ducting for the lights.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a couple of ways to do the lights,
but I would run the lights, the ducting
[SPEAKER_09]: straight through the hut so that the light
heat never makes it into the hut.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a hole on the left side and the
right side of the huts at the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang the blower inside the hut on one
side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Run the ducting from the outside over the
blower, over the light, and out of the
[SPEAKER_09]: other side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that way the heat, if that makes
sense, you just make a tunnel right
[SPEAKER_09]: through it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The heat never actually stays inside the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a little hole in the roof of
the huts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a blower there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said roof, just the roof.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a blower there to pull fresh air
through the hut constantly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put a carbon filter and a blower inside
the hut and fit it out of the top there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes the airflow pull air in from the
bottom and the heat goes out the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always remember that your blower can pull
more air than it can push.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote down a lot of shitty half-ass
notes right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of those notes were full sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blowers work better when they're outside
of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same reason you never see the
fart fan in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always mounted up in the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to pull air out than it is to
push it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely easier to pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you run a carbon filter in tents when
you're collecting pollen?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't because I don't have a blower all
in my tent where I'm collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got him in his own 3x3 hut with one
coily CFL in there to keep him awake and
[SPEAKER_09]: that's all because I can't create any heat
because I don't want to suck the pollen
[SPEAKER_09]: out.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just in there with the CFL.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can take a peek when we're done if you
want.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you don't want to because there's
pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll need a shower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's more shit that I don't tell people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take a brown paper bag and put it right
over the top cola and secure it.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I'm sure that I see him nutting a
whole bunch, I just cut that sucker off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I have the branch sticking out of the
bag.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll hold it with my hand around the
branch and pull the branch out of the bag
[SPEAKER_09]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_09]: As you pull you knock everything off into
the bag and you just come out with a
[SPEAKER_09]: stick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you just clean up the ... Get the
material out of there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use a drum head actually, an old drum
head.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flip it upside down and pour all of my
shit under there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I got the idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I'm going to repurpose that
shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you leave those in the hut with that
bag over there with the blower on the top,
[SPEAKER_09]: it doesn't steal a lot of your pollen but
it does take some.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit, but you're going to make
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also phenol hunting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I already know that male is who I want so
I just let him sit in there and just jizz
[SPEAKER_09]: away and collect it.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just circle tricking or bukkake in a bag
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just pollen chucking this time.
[SPEAKER_09]: This male, this is the same male probably
his 10th time pollinating shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: A clone of the same male.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the same guy, but a clone of that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is his 10th time hitting stuff at
least.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My one male that I already have picked
out, proven himself and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took clones of him the other day and I
took like 25 just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will only keep one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to have one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited that all the clones I recently
took, they all cut or they all rooted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the seeds I've sprouted are all
germinating and I'm working on another
[SPEAKER_09]: project.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I even want to tell
everybody this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am starting to F2 Black Cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing the phenol hunt to find the male
and the female to F2 that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I plan to start the flowering cycle right
at the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: By March 1st-ish I should have found a
good male and a good female that will be
[SPEAKER_09]: used.
[SPEAKER_09]: The clones of those will be ran next to be
bred to make.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll use two females and one male.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll use a purple female and a non-purple
female and see what the progeny make.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely a solid purple male.
[SPEAKER_09]: I may make it recessive if I force too
much purple into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It may not come out until the F3 if I do
that with the two purples.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys are paying attention to
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's random shit right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also another way that I've been setting up
these tents with just one blower because
[SPEAKER_09]: it seems efficient if you're in a small
space.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put the 5x5 hut with the blower on the
roof outside of the hut.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually sitting.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's that hole right on top.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just set the blower right on top of
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I run ducting into the hut and then around
into the light reflector and then ducting
[SPEAKER_09]: out of the light reflector to a carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_09]: The carbon filter is hung really high in
the hut, as high as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're filtering the air, pulling out
humidity and cooling your light all at one
[SPEAKER_09]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those work great in the garage right now
in Colorado in the winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need a heater more than you need
coolers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to put a heater in there at night
to keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got two of those huts,
you could run them side by side and you
[SPEAKER_09]: could vent that heat into the other hut
from your light if you thought about how
[SPEAKER_09]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sleeping plants emit CO2.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you move the air from your sleeping
room into your awake room, you are moving
[SPEAKER_09]: CO2 to a usable space.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a definite good hint for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if mushroom bags are on that CO2
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to keep harping on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're talking about using tanks
is what they're afraid of because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: unsafe because we have to travel with
tanks and we don't have any sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: licensing or anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: But my argument, because I am going to go
to city council when this comes up,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say this is available at the
hydroponics store.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can the guy growing tomatoes or the
guy growing orchids or whatever else he's
[SPEAKER_09]: using, why can he have CO2?
[SPEAKER_09]: And since I'm a cannabis grower,
I cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drive around with a bottle of acetylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk about something fucking
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no special license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down to Airgas and they gave it to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I signed a contract that says I wouldn't
damage their bottle, but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all they cared about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin our container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could blow up a freaking building with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_09]: Accidentally you could on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capability lies there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be the last one to ever do that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you just said that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got paranoid right after you said it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, I can't say that on the air,
can I?
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't say that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Abort.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many more dangerous things out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's save this for Mike.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need you back on the show here in a
week or two because you've been going to
[SPEAKER_09]: those meetings.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not my thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad you're going.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need you to come update us with what's
going on in our community and what kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: rules they're trying to enforce on us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to go the other night,
but the fucking weather.
[SPEAKER_09]: The growers have been busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the night it got shitty.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of chilly out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, it's snowing instantly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I was wearing shorts that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 60 degrees and within an hour
it was fucking damn near freezing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Minus six was cold the other night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was driving home.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was nice and cold at minus six.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freaking cold right now, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was coming down like crazy out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting better at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you're prepared, the first few win-
I'm from California, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I first moved here, winter killed me
and now I don't get knocked on wood.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get sick like I used to.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I first moved here, I'd get terribly
sick every winter just because I didn't
[SPEAKER_09]: know what to do with minus six.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to go to school.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you even dress for this?
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to dress like it's Antarctica to
get to school.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you get to school,
it's 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Living in the classroom, so now you're
sweating your ass off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to learn how to adjust without
getting sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Durango, so I've been used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in Pueblo softened me up,
so this is like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: These generations are getting softer as we
go.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about a doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our good buddy, Spence, had his appendix
removed and Jesse was kind enough to post
[SPEAKER_09]: a meme of a doctor removing his own damn
appendix on Spencer's Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cute.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this generation, I don't know how many
people would just reach down and remove
[SPEAKER_09]: their own appendix.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're too entitled.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shouldn't somebody else do this?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of where we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, if you have more questions about a
hydro hut, I'm pretty good at them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you got a question, I can set up your
hydro hut like a champ.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can give you a lot of advice on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bracing, sometimes these hoods and you get
a carbon filter and a blower and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything hung up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy ways to brace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go buy some PVC and just freaking tape it
really tight or tie it to the other roof
[SPEAKER_00]: beams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help give you a little structure
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen someone screw a ... They had a
four by four hood, so they took a four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four piece plywood and screwed it to the
roof on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really, really strengthened that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, the dude could have stood on the top
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are a little rickety.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a little wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're putting a heavy ... If you don't
have the right carbon filter, the good
[SPEAKER_09]: carbon filters are heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: They sell lighter ones that are more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have that one, putting a lot
of weight up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: A light is expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're hanging a triple XL Raptor,
that's some heavy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't need one of those in a
tent, just a little tent there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the eight inch sun ... Sunstar?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know exactly which reflectors I love.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Radiant Sixes.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Radiant Six or the Radiant Eight.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the size of a shoe box.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice and light.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think instead of a big wide reflector,
a little reflector is better.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can make a sexual joke out of this if
you want, but I want it to go deeper.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want it so wide.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want my light to penetrate the canopy a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say you get better
penetration.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want more penetration.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need you tearing it apart so wide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still ... You got a thousand watts is
a thousand watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your reflector is spreading it out to a
five by five area or you have a reflector
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading it out to a three by three area,
which reflector, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better value for that thousand watts room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it's going to be the three
by three every time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: In those huts, those huts are very well
made with that reflective material in
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I get a lot more lumens out of
those huts than I do the open rooms that I
[SPEAKER_09]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take better pictures too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure they got that sexy background in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of this is the same if you're working
in a bedroom or a closet, just on a
[SPEAKER_09]: smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't cut holes for ducting,
try using a window.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about tricking you on the
windows.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, use some of that blue foam
board.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's for insulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got it at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cut that to size.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pop that in your window with some duct
tape.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need to cut holes out of that,
I take actually, I use a pre-made six inch
[SPEAKER_09]: or eight inch flange that's used for a
blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: I set that on that blue foam board and I
just step on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I cut holes in my foam board.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect sizes for my ducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put your shoe on and step on it because
then she'll cut the piss out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off flange.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you got to knock that out because it
gets stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to use something to punch it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice little life hack is the
popular new term on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of trying to cut, just be lazy and
stomp it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use a drywall saw and make a
gigantic mess everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That blue, when you cut that blue foam
board, it's going to make a gigantic foamy
[SPEAKER_09]: mess everywhere and it'll clog up your
saws like nothing other.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets real hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Disguise your out ducts.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can duct it out of the attic or a
chimney, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want your neighbors seeing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's minus six outside right now where my
heat is dumping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure it's making steam.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it's 20 degrees, it'll probably
make steam dumping into minus six.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can see your air coming out of your
grow space at 80 degrees coming out of the
[SPEAKER_09]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melting snow off the roof.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a guy in another neighborhood
that a friend of mine and I used to make
[SPEAKER_09]: fun of because every morning at seven o
'clock you could see the blower click in
[SPEAKER_09]: and the one section would clear from the
swirl.
[SPEAKER_09]: About 30 minutes later, one side of the
roof would be all clear.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where his grow space is.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see it in the attic right up
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got all your automation.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got everything ducted.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got lights going.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got timers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, it's almost time to add plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say get everything set up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Run the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Set all of your timers and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Run a cycle or two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure your air conditioner kicks in
when it gets too hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure the lights go off and on as
planned.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay attention to the temps and humidity
without the plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the time to make corrections.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, an empty room runs
hotter than a room full of plants when
[SPEAKER_00]: plants absorb heat and energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It will also be less humid without plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be hotter.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I put plants in, the plants are
going to cool it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a guess if I were running this
eight by eight room, how many degrees my
[SPEAKER_09]: plants are going to drop it?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's completely right, but I thought he
may have done more thought on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've noticed it, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also know that when I'm in there,
I heat the room up ridiculously.
[SPEAKER_09]: So fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really noticed it mostly on tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed it on gigantic rooms too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at least a couple of degrees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dirt can hold a shit ton of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reservoirs, they'll hold heat too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we heat greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I've seen you guys put
big jugs of water in the sun and then haul
[SPEAKER_09]: it into the greenhouse at night to keep
them warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend Ryan actually was heating bricks
in his oven.
[SPEAKER_09]: He would put a big pot of bricks.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was just making a pot roast full of
bricks and he'd heat those up and then go
[SPEAKER_09]: outside and cover the plants in a tarp and
then put the hot bricks underneath the
tarp.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just harvested like a week ago in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of all these cold weathers,
let's go down to Walmarts.
[SPEAKER_00]: My greenhouse, I harvested all the plants
right before it got freezing cold in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a couple of containers with
lettuce and spinach and radish and onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super stoked that with my little
time heater, my little greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spinach made it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's some of the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is frozen fucking dead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Frozen vegetables already.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, guys, we're getting 50 minutes
in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, run your rooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Run the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run that bad bitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Run it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once everything is cool,
then you can put plants in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're going to have to make a
couple of adjustments once you put plants
[SPEAKER_09]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're just vegging, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tweak around with your rooms while
you're vegging.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not
[SPEAKER_09]: going to piss the plants off too much.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got a good breeding project,
keep it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to be really kind of secretive and
I didn't like to share my breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: information because I feel like I'll teach
you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: But breeding, you got to get a good grasp
on breed on growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once you've got that, then you'll kind
of learn how to breed with that on
[SPEAKER_09]: accident.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I kind of been sharing a little bit of
my breeding secrets.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you guys have a specific question,
I'd rather help you than just watch you
[SPEAKER_09]: fail is how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not help you do it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got started, I won't mention
any names, but I hit up a couple of guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just with some basic questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got told to, you know, fuck off
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always kind of disheartened me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also encouraged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, screw these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do this.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just taking a little time to research
stuff and read it on your own goes a long
[SPEAKER_09]: way.
[SPEAKER_09]: The internet is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, and I've been banned from so many
forums and chats.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote because the internet is full of
shit and people will type whatever they
[SPEAKER_09]: want without knowing what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel that that sucks because it
causes problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's part of what inspired this show was
reading shit on the internet going,
[SPEAKER_09]: dude, I hope nobody tried that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually seeing somebody ask his
friend a question on a forum.
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like troll it up, but it's not
troll it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been banned.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to advertise the site,
but on troll it up, somebody asked a
[SPEAKER_09]: question and the guy replied with a
totally bullshit answer to his friend.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try it today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, dude, don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your friend just killed your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: However many plants you have, they're dead
if you do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's part of what inspired this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to get people to know what
they're doing to come and put a good voice
[SPEAKER_09]: out for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thing on the probiotics farmers
Alliance, a pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the very first post.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever join it, I can't quote it for
verbatim, but by any means, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it just says essentially,
you know, don't make something fact just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really recreate it, but yeah,
it's just, you know, there's so much shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and people just type shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they believe it and they're full of
shit themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what worked for them may not work for
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your situation could be totally different.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I'm a member of that group
anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I won't be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to leave that group because they put
up too much stuff and I got way too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a great place, but yeah,
I'm not in the group.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't view their stuff, but still
good group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of the gauge green genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sharing incredible knowledge.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an incredible genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: This stuff has been putting out lately is
super impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually breed with a gauge green
genetics, daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's how much I liked that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've made my own F2 daybreaker male to use
so that I don't have to use gauges
[SPEAKER_09]: original workings.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two days to have my own.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam was here the other night and I cut
down nine daybreaker plants that were
[SPEAKER_09]: about three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, just, uh, eugenics basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: They weren't for what I needed for that
project.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he didn't know what to think,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not, he's not an avid pot gardener.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, hold this trash bag open for
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was chop, chop, chop, chop,
chop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he just went, oh, he told me I made
him sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, my heart's broken, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last spring I had a plant that got some
mold and I didn't notice it till we were
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I saw him through the fricking
thing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy that was open each room,
uh, I'm pretty sure he wanted to go take
[SPEAKER_00]: through the trash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a, like your situation, I had a
white rhino plant that had to be five
[SPEAKER_09]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the top cola was as big as a football.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the size of this Gatorade bottle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, it was this season of the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was a lot of cold in the air.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, that plant, I know it
already.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kept checking it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing kept checking it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_09]: The center of one bud had mildew all up
the middle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I threw the whole plant away because I
didn't want to go fish through every bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my, my trimmer buddy, Mike,
it was Mike at the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just kind of new friends at the
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just put a trash bag over it and threw
it all away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like the whole thing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, yeah, we can't mess with
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a, that's the difference between a pot
farmer and a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm growing medical weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: The person that would have sold that is
just growing shitty weed for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, I mean, yeah, there's just
so, so many reasons to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't like failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to keep a moldy plant
around my house to spread mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take some pride in what you do guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're working really hard at grown
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make people sicker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make people feel better.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like we went over a whole bunch of
information and kind of a scattered way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, keep your plants off the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep your plants up off the ground,
especially in this cold weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep everything off the concrete floor you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your nutrients, your water reservoir,
clone trays most definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're running an easy cloner and
you need that cool water.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
True.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, but if you figure that
out, you know, you're probably one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys that's just getting
entertainment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for listening guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to, we're going to definitely
get more advanced as we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're 40 episodes in, you guys are
learning stuff now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm learning stuff now because I have
to read just to make sure I don't lie to
[SPEAKER_09]: you because I made a mistake on the show
one time and I felt really stupid.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to go teaching wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely had to come back and correct
myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been making sure to read
everything and stay on top.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading more about nutrients because I
know about nutrients, but you get so
[SPEAKER_09]: comfortable that you don't even pay
attention anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, yeah, I know when I look at that
plant, that's a phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to give it some phosphorus and I
just get in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to kind of brush up a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be doing that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly with my profession,
but, um, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those times when you're sitting there in
the store, ready to pull your beard out,
[SPEAKER_09]: just grab a book.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got the internet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've got a, I actually got a couple of
books down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrofarm sent us a free book for
employees and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of our other employees is reading
it right now, but I can't wait to go over
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about indoor hydroponic
gardening, not pot specific or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And hydrofarms afraid of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like how you have to hold back on that
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, if you ever really want to know my
view on that, come see me at the store.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked to several other hydro shop
owners and you guys all seem to agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody feels the same about Sunlight
and Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our customers built, I'll say this,
our customers, built them a hell of a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: living.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, I feel like it's about time to wrap
up the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been going for almost an hour here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Jesse, you got anybody to shout out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody to say thanks to anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Bernd and everyone down at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had a good experience in there
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, let me think of a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been digging on, uh, on some SF EOT
lately, big time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when do I get my cut of that SF EOT?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought you already had one.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I know where yours came from and
they don't want me to have it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't give it to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Being a breeder, dude, people don't want
you to have their cuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, uh, kind of SF E's made a lot of
great strains and I think we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a couple with it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guarantee we'll make a couple.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make a couple.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll make a couple.

[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me on mic tonight, our good buddy
Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our good buddy Adam is here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam hasn't been here for a while.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tired?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sick and tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's about time you're doing some
work.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had a little mini vacation for a
minute there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was longer than a mini one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to the working community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's turn that music down a little bit
and get a podcast going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we're going to talk about some cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, somebody was supposed to come.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not blaming anything on Jesse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse was trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He can't make it tonight, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_09]: So had to kind of replan the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we blame it on Jesse?
[SPEAKER_09]: We can, it's Jesse's fault.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not going to, actually,
Jesse has been trying to get an
[SPEAKER_09]: electrician to his new grow facility and
that dude's been putting them off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, tonight he showed up and he
called me and I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_09]: do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I know how hard it is to get an
electrician to your facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once he's there, you're paying him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's hard to get him there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just keep him there and get the work
done.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Jesse had to take a rain check.
[SPEAKER_09]: If he can come over later or tomorrow,
I'll put out another show in the middle of
[SPEAKER_09]: the week with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Jesse was kind enough to host another
party at Hydro last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to, before I even forget,
before I have a chance to forget,
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to give a huge shout out to NanoLux
lighting and Hydro indoor growing
[SPEAKER_09]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, everyone just looked over across the
room here.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a brand new, pretty new toy,
dual ended bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a ballast and reflector all attached
into one piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the new NanoLux 1000 watt that
actually has a 1200 watt setting on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to be cranking 1200 watts in
one section.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to see what that light
does.
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave it to me to run it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, run a couple cycles,
let us know what you think.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll talk about the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that works out, NanoLux may be a
podcast sponsor in the future here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really cool new toy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to see what she does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fancy looking light for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it's one of the, uh, the dual ended
bulbs and it's the kind that's got the
[SPEAKER_09]: ballast and, uh, it's got a short
reflector and I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got it all in one piece and it all
hangs from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it's only the, is it 240 or 220?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only the 240 plug.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I always get that one confused.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not good with remembering that many
goddamn numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: They mess with my brain, but I have a good
feeling about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, they gave it to me because they know
I'm going to kick ass with it and see what
[SPEAKER_09]: it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I probably should have asked before
I touched, but that's one of the first
[SPEAKER_08]: things I did when I walked in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Adam walked in and just opened the
box.
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched it and didn't get too much of a
shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just looking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to see if it was still in
the box.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to break anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do, you get to buy me a new light.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, what else are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_09]: We all sat around today, like a bunch of
bros and took dads and watched a movie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we're going to talk a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we're actually going to watch a video
on the show together because some of us
[SPEAKER_09]: have seen it, some haven't, and I want to
watch it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually I haven't seen it to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know I need to watch it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to watch it live on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that I can give you my reaction live on
the air.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, but before we get that far,
we have to do this stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This podcast is brought to you by our good
friends at highly educated titanium.

[SPEAKER_09]: That's so much better.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just got that tone that it gets lost
in the mics.
[SPEAKER_09]: That tone is hard to record.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes me a minute to get comfortable at
the beginning of every show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry listeners.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get you here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, uh, I was going to talk about this

growing supplies grower meeting,
[SPEAKER_09]: gave a class lecture on taking clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice little clone lesson.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That dude killed it, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually did a hell of a good job.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to cut this music out.

[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the track you just heard was DJ and a
dance, the instrumental version.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were kind enough to send me every
track they've done instrumental.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we've got a lot of fresh music for
the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to Jesse, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: He did a hell of a good job hosting that
party last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk more about that in a
minute, but I want to get that shout out
[SPEAKER_09]: before I get forget because for some
reason I get forgetful.
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a dab here in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone was talking about a pre-show dab,

[SPEAKER_09]: Read that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have any comments to read.
[SPEAKER_09]: So guess what that means, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to take a quick dab and then
we're going to come back and we are going
[SPEAKER_09]: to review a couple of videos that we
watched and we'll actually watch a video
[SPEAKER_09]: on the air.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, stick around.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody at the table got super chatty.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said it as soon as I decided to turn off
the mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm turning the mics back on.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're back on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, dude, we weren't, we weren't
fucking, we were sitting there waiting for
[SPEAKER_08]: you to pay the bills and you know,
pay the dues and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, all that shit's important.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a dab on that on the
show since, uh, since the mics came back
[SPEAKER_09]: on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give a big shout out while I
heat up the nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, somebody remind me the name of this
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to feel like an asshole cause I
forgot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Higher elevation masterpiece productions
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a broken rig.
[SPEAKER_09]: The joint got broken off.
[SPEAKER_09]: It busted right off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, my email pulled the nail off,
pulled the joint right off and busted that
[SPEAKER_09]: shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I took it there and they charged me a
good price and they fixed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this sucker looks brand new,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't tell it's a repair.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hits brand new.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did it in a timely manner.
[SPEAKER_09]: The price was right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the little chick that works there is
super sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's super friendly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go back there when I need a repair.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully I don't ever need a damn repair.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: When do you guys talk about something
chaotic?
[SPEAKER_08]: We, um, we went there and I mean,
we were looking, he was looking for a rig,
[SPEAKER_08]: but they had tons of little tiny rigs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, little tiny miniature cakes like
his phase two over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was, I mean, maybe this big,
the smaller shake, you know, for only,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, there weren't two or three
inches off the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even that, not three inches,
maybe two and a half.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but compared to what we have here
locally in town, you know, it was,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was definitely a, it had more
selection.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just had shit crammed in cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they barely had room, you know,
but there was definitely selection and,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, anything that you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was definitely a cool place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, met a friendly dude in there that was,
you know, he was talkative and he had
[SPEAKER_08]: some, some golden goat or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it goat or was it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's some golden goat hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he didn't really have anything
to do with the store though.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't go expecting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I didn't know if he had anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was just hanging out in there throwing
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a customer trying to be
social.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never known any place that can fix a
broken piece before.
[SPEAKER_06]: You break a piece, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say goodbye, bury that sucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this looks brand new people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might be able to save it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I got a hookup or
anything, cause they kind of, I've been in
[SPEAKER_09]: there a little bit, but the price they
charged me, I was blown away at how cheap
[SPEAKER_09]: it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as I'm concerned, it's a miracle.
[SPEAKER_06]: They made me drop, I didn't know this was
a thing before.
[SPEAKER_09]: They made me drop a deposit on it,
which was cheap, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: You pay the deposit to have it repaired.
[SPEAKER_09]: They repair it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they, if they break it when it's
getting repaired, you get a 30% off the
[SPEAKER_09]: rig of your choice in the store.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: My voice will come back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I sound weird cause I just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all choked up trying to get this dab
going for Adam.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was wider here, correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's thinner right there?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it tapered a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tapered just like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like they cut it off right at the
top of, cause I broke it right where the
[SPEAKER_09]: new joint, the line is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I broke it right, the old one broke right
there anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they just cleaned it up and put a new
one on nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a dab for Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike's going to cough forever after this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys be prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's really good hash at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Turpex.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Turpex, dude, you guys killed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gatsby, I shouted you guys out last week
and you got it, but we're dabbing some
[SPEAKER_08]: super lemon haze right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, once it hits the back of your
throat, it's definitely limitless.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's my stash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had this set aside for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had some of the sour grapes and it was
some of the better shatter that I've
[SPEAKER_08]: tasted here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So big shout out to those guys up there
and Springs rocking it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jordan and Jordan.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why you don't smoke tobacco
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You hear Mike over there trying to die.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like he needs oxygen.
[SPEAKER_09]: He needs scuba gear just to do a podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pull a couple.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've all been there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've all been there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for you who is iron lunged.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes dude, at the end of the day it
hurts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't, sometimes I have to wait till
seven, 10 in the evening to take a good
[SPEAKER_09]: dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not every time, but the gram dab did
not make me cough though.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you hit that thing for two and a half
minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was doing what I do, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you dab much at all, or with people at
all, you see quickly if you smoke tobacco,
[SPEAKER_06]: you dab and then you sound like me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You dab and sound like Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound like this on the radio.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound like you should be our radio
host.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a face for radio, sir.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's bring this meeting to order.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we talked a little bit about the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike was kind enough to show up to the
grow meeting hosted by high grow indoor
[SPEAKER_09]: growing supplies last night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a text.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, I eat too much and I can't move.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're supposed to bring me food.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wonder if that means that I'm not
getting food.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more mingle than lesson time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I liked that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: The lesson was, I think, I realized about
halfway through that most of us were
[SPEAKER_09]: probably able to do everything that Jesse
was teaching, but I'm glad he took that as
[SPEAKER_09]: his first teaching opportunity because
he's good now, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's learning and he's catching up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Being on this podcast has really made him
a better student.
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked a bad spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I tried to watch Jesse while he was
talking, I would have been watching his
[SPEAKER_06]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was watching everyone else watch
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cloning isn't complicated, but he went
over all the steps real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at one point, everybody in the room
pretty much went, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And took a second to pull their phone out
or grab a pen and jot down a little note
[SPEAKER_06]: like, I should use this product or I'm
keeping it too wet or too dry or over or
[SPEAKER_06]: under watering or, I mean, just little
simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was definitely the little talk
afterward, the fine tuning talk about,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, you're probably over watering if
that's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're probably under watering.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what was cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what was really valuable after
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But dude, Jesse did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm super proud of him.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_09]: You did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, I'm all choked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, huge shout out to Bern.
[SPEAKER_09]: She lets us throw a party back there in
the back of the store.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of her store.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's her baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for letting us make a mess in
your place.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got like 12 dudes hanging out back
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for the invite to the social
gathering there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a good time there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do that every month and we'll
announce the dates on this show.
[SPEAKER_09]: We try to get as many people as we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Armando, bro, I look forward to you being
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry you couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully we can have another one in
December.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: December is kind of rough for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of holidays there for all
the different religious groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to have... They are talking about
doing a December event.
[SPEAKER_06]: They brought it up at least twice last
night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't remember what the date was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they've had one nailed down
yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a little space, a big space heater
if we decide to do it back there in
[SPEAKER_09]: December, because it was a little chilly,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes chilly is what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if a room is that vapor filled,
we'll go with...
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a private party.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to open the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: The private party things happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's invite only, huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about, you were saying the larger
area towards the outside of town that
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe you would be able to get at one
point in time.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're definitely looking at another social
club that'll be a private party thing that
[SPEAKER_09]: will be an invite only.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just thinking for that since it was
no heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: It works perfectly so far.
[SPEAKER_09]: We like doing it at the store because I
talk about a product and I can run down
[SPEAKER_09]: the hallway and grab it and be like,
this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole bunch of people left with stuff,
which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I told the story once, but I'm sitting
there and the night's pretty much over.
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole bunch of people left with products
that they bought after the grow lesson is
[SPEAKER_06]: what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were a bunch of people that left
with stuff like you left with stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: People were given... They give out gifts.
[SPEAKER_09]: They definitely give out prizes and shit
for people coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start doing contests and
shit also.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just getting it started.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't our forte.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just decided that it needed to be...
Jesse decided... I'm taking credit for
[SPEAKER_09]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse did all of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: He decided that this needed to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's learning and I'm helping him
learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a hell of a little shop down
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't you say that you two inspire each
other?
[SPEAKER_09]: We completely inspire each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been talking about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse is now officially a part of Iri
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's breeding seeds that will be
available.
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as I think our plan goes,
they'll be in Iri Genetics packaging and
[SPEAKER_09]: on the Iri Genetics website.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to add them to here and
I'll give Jesse credit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse is now breeding, it's not all me,
those strains that they'll be specifically
[SPEAKER_09]: specific strains that he does.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sitting there at the Hygro meeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm chilling, talking to people just like
we do, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm nice and dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jesse comes up and he slides a NanoLux
1000 watt light, a full kit right in front
[SPEAKER_09]: of me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he goes, here man, run this and let me
know what you think.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was shocked, I think is the only
word I can come up with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas doesn't just appear in front of
you on a Friday in November.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it did last night for you and it was
fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was neat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was confused because I'm not used to
getting a big, that's a big ass gift to
[SPEAKER_09]: get.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a nice- Yeah, that was huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see it coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I saw Jesse give it to you,
I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But look at this way though, in three
months when you come back to them,
[SPEAKER_08]: like, do you do like a trading credit?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I take, can you take these five and
can I get four more of those?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like that'll speak volumes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's NanoLux is the company.
[SPEAKER_09]: NanoLux and Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies
get mad respect from me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: I post a lot of stuff as iregenetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That light really honestly won't get hung
until December.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a crop that's growing in the room
where that will go.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when that crop finishes, that light
will go up and then we'll start under
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it kicks as much ass as it appears,
if it, you know, as it looks, you'll be in
[SPEAKER_06]: the shop buying three more of them here
come March.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll buy four or five more.
[SPEAKER_09]: My only concern is venting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those don't match up with my venting
style.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can only run those in the winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can, you know, if they kick as much
ass as people have been saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: I can readjust my rooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: All I have to do is change air
conditioning.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could just go change up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Couldn't you just shorten the pipes and
kind of ducked out from the main room from
[SPEAKER_08]: top and filter into the bottom,
you know, cool air in, hot air out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the lights I'm running now are ducted.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the heat from the lights I'm running
now doesn't ever make it to the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are not ducted.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the only, only downside that I'm
seeing right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's all one unit, which I've never
seen before.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ballast and the light is all usually
separated.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all one solid, really well-built
unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it looks like it's well-built.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's much lighter than it looks also.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like it's heavy as hell,
but it's really light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's do this since we're talking about
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where did I set that one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: This podcast is brought to you by Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that happened just like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Visit the Denver store at 62-71 Beach
Street or check out the Pueblo location at
[SPEAKER_09]: 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_09]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hygro, I got to catch up with myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hygro is running a special for the podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you check out at Hygro, tell them you
listen to the Hygro Culture podcast and
[SPEAKER_09]: they will give you commercial pricing on
your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a sweet deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was talking about it the other night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought a bag of dirt, that bag of dirt
that you see part of it on the ground
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That bag of dirt is a $25 bag of dirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid about $17 and some jingles,
some change in there for that bag of dirt
[SPEAKER_09]: out the door because I paid commercial
pricing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a hell of a deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: We pay what the dispensaries pay is what
our pricing is.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you use that code, if you tell them,
I listen to the Hygro Culture podcast,
[SPEAKER_09]: pay the same prices.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good deal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh dude, it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially for someone like me,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone low budget.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Low budget.
[SPEAKER_08]: Low budget, if you're listening,
hey, you could save yourself some money
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coupons, coupons, some coupons.
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of couponing, shout out to Matty.
[SPEAKER_09]: What up, Matty?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're the coupon queen.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good to see you back in action,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: You looked good last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I saw Spence last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spence is back in action.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back on his feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: That dude weighs 140 pounds now.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's about six, he's somewhere between six
four and six five, depending on who you
[SPEAKER_06]: ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never run into people taller than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's one of the few.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's 140 pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you guys send him some calories.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can mentally put calories on my
brother Spence, just send them right to
[SPEAKER_09]: him because he needs some help right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel it because, you know, pressure
coming in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So wish him luck and glad to see he's back
home.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's... Are you wishing him luck for the
secret cup?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you're wishing him luck for?
[SPEAKER_08]: That may be what I'm wishing him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows what I mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the secret cup is coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The finals.
[SPEAKER_09]: The finals.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I expect that to be...
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_09]: About December 15th-ish because that's
around when he'll be back, I predict.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm just guessing, being
hypothetical here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the second week of December,
maybe the beginning of the third week of
[SPEAKER_09]: December, you think right here in Mike's
chair, you think we'll have the secret cup
[SPEAKER_09]: winner, Garden of Whedon and his lovely
lady, Maddie, sitting right next to us
[SPEAKER_09]: right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do, can I be in the chair that's
behind the dab stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'll just sit in the corner and be
quiet for that show.
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair with no mic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's a chair that sometimes
people sit in and there's no mic.
[SPEAKER_09]: The mic sits right here next to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could fire this mic up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a droopy stand from what I
understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does, but I've got a replacement.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes people don't want to be heard
and they just sit here and dish out dabs
[SPEAKER_09]: and just sit on the podcast and just
watch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'd look them in the eye when I
do the intro and stuff and I have someone
[SPEAKER_09]: to talk to.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you hear those lively ass intros,
they're all, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to another episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because there's someone here to
fire me up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Adam's been here for a night.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the podcast world, when you're doing a
microphone and you got a voice going and
[SPEAKER_09]: you got like the energy, sometimes you
fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a night, one night when Adam and
I sat here for probably 45 minutes just
[SPEAKER_09]: going, so welcome to the fucking show.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are failing miserably with a rhythm and
a conversation and a lesson.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you should probably fast forward
through the rest of this show because
[SPEAKER_09]: tonight is not our flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just skip episode 12.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of how it felt.
[SPEAKER_09]: We pulled it off eventually through the
magic of editing and a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw some more chatter at the problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even want to talk about where it
went.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just went, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Imaginary characters walked into the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's put it that way on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of us might've been hearing voices.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been, this is going to be,
guys, this is going to be one of those
[SPEAKER_09]: episodes where we just kind of revel.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're still listening, we love you,
tweet at us and we'll send you free shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, Mike said that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So tweet at Mike and he will send you free
shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be good free shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be a big pen, but it'll be some
free shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a pen I chewed on at city council
one night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something we can go into.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about any of that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you heard about any of that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the city councilor.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So since Adam wants to just run right into
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that every now and then.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what my notes for.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how much time do you think you can wrap
that up in quite quickly and not bore the
[SPEAKER_09]: shit out of anybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: I condense everything you need to know
into just a little paragraph or two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, this may be local news for most of
what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is happening in my town and in my
county.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is very pertinent to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a home grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I grow my personal medicine here in my
house.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do some small stuff in my home because
that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everything has to happen in a large
facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am Mike's medical marijuana provider and
his caregiver.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's happening pertains to Mike.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a very real way.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to enforce rules upon me
and my grow that will, it's going to fuck
[SPEAKER_09]: with Mike's medicine supply.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been trying to find a classier way to
say that, but it's going to hint under my
[SPEAKER_09]: production of Mike's quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mike relies on me for medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mike is going to city council.
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep cutting you off, but I'm setting
you up good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike is going to city council to make sure
this doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is super important to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: This shit could happen in your area and
someone's got to stand up and do what Mike
[SPEAKER_09]: does.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're doing that, I give you a huge
shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to turn it over to Mike for a
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me what you learned at city council
recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So down here in Pueblo, Colorado,
they're looking at passing home grow rules
[SPEAKER_06]: in the city and in the county.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two very separate efforts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go to two very separate
meetings to be involved with this process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the planning and zoning
department with the city has finalized
[SPEAKER_06]: their proposal.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're sending that recommendation onto
city council.
[SPEAKER_06]: City council will receive it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I expect that to happen at their first
meeting in December.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's December 8th.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then their final meeting in December
on December 22nd, they'll be taking,
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll likely be taking public comment
and a vote on these proposed home grow
[SPEAKER_06]: rules that will essentially limit every
caregiver in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really, really ugly rules,
folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get down to city council on
the 22nd and speak out against these rules
[SPEAKER_06]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also down in the county.
[SPEAKER_06]: That meeting is going to be taking place
on December 10th at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that meeting's a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark your calendars.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can get down there, check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're interested in local Pueblo
cannabis law news, check out Pueblo for
[SPEAKER_06]: sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to post this stuff up as fast
as I can, but getting digital copies of
[SPEAKER_06]: the ordinances that I can easily post to
Facebook has been a little tricky,
[SPEAKER_06]: but info about the meetings and what you
can do to help out, that's the best place
[SPEAKER_06]: to look right now if you're looking for
that kind of info.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's essentially it, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just mainly on caregivers?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the rules are going to... The city
and the county rules are different.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an extension of what you already
went to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll definitely go for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you need support on, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rules as they stand right now,
there's a whole lot of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't make a whole lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing a whole bunch of private
lobbying, trying to stop them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tell me an example of a couple of
the stupid rules they're trying to put
[SPEAKER_09]: out?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're banning all CO2.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you grabbed that one right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a rule that I find ridiculous
because there are people at the CO2,
[SPEAKER_09]: where he's talking about CO2 for CO2
augmentation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We run CO2 in grow rooms because the CO2
plants would thrive with more CO2 than
[SPEAKER_09]: what's naturally available in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_09]: In your natural grow, you probably have
about three to 500, probably right around
[SPEAKER_09]: 400 particles per million of CO2.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to the hydro shop, they'll set
you up with a system where you can get
[SPEAKER_09]: about...
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be cool if you could get about
1200 to 1800 PPMs of CO2 in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: What that does is your plants breathe that
and they grow much more vigorously.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get bigger buds, you get denser buds,
you get larger plants, and it makes them
[SPEAKER_09]: grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So tomato growers use this.
[SPEAKER_06]: All kinds of indoor plant growers use CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these rules are written so that
they could easily be applied to anybody
[SPEAKER_06]: doing the same thing with something that's
not cannabis, but it's all cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully the city council will see how
much nonsense this is and send the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: matter back to planning and zoning for a
redo.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's done that they pick out
CO2 because the tomato farmer can go to
[SPEAKER_09]: the hydro shop and buy it and take it to
his house and run it in the basement just
[SPEAKER_09]: like Adam would in his basement grow,
just like Mike would in his basement grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They heard something that sounded scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they wrote a rule that says you
can't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because they don't know what they're
talking about and the research didn't get
[SPEAKER_06]: done, a lot of the rules don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've described it to other people as
listening to a five-year-old lecture on
[SPEAKER_06]: calculus.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter how much homework they
did the night before.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the lecture will be total nonsense
from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And anyone not throwing rocks is doing so
out of being polite.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just painful to watch.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last time we went, two of the council
at least seemed to be, I won't say
[SPEAKER_08]: pro-pot, but not against it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say anyone on council is
pro-pot, but there are some that are
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in what legal marijuana can do
for the city.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's still the minority of
the vote.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an uphill climb for sure,
which is why I keep bringing it up on this
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast, because people need to show up to
these meetings and start pitching in.
[SPEAKER_06]: If planning and zonings work on the
marijuana rules is indicative of their
[SPEAKER_06]: work on other rules, that might be an
explanation into why nothing works here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might just be that nobody's paid
attention to government for so long that
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't expect to get caught just doing
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people aren't aware that we can
just go to city council and sign up and
[SPEAKER_09]: sit at that little cozy chair with a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it's cushy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's intimidating if you're not that kind
of person, but the first time you go,
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I could go now.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I had some real business to go deal
with, I could go speak there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's inviting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody can go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, Adam looks like a homeless
person with headphones on.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's wearing an irie genetics hoodie that
could use a wash.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got some dreadlocks that are the same
as the hoodie.
[SPEAKER_09]: They definitely could use a wash.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got a tore up green t-shirt under
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't see his pants, but his shoes are
definitely muddy as crap.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with holes in the bottom of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: But dude, you're invited to go talk in
city council.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can speak and nobody will judge you.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll listen to what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: They may judge you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm lying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw them definitely condescendingly
judge one person for a few minutes and it
[SPEAKER_09]: was almost entertaining.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can go speak and you can say your
piece and you get, I think, five full
[SPEAKER_09]: solid minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: During public comment, they give anyone
who wants to come and sign up five full
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes to speak on anything they'd like
to.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this happens in every city.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got a city hall that has city
council meetings, you can go and you can,
[SPEAKER_09]: even if it's something that one guy came
and talked for six minutes about the bike
[SPEAKER_09]: lane and how to use them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, it felt like he was
giving the city council a lesson on how to
[SPEAKER_09]: use bike lanes, but I think he was asking
for more funding to create more bike lanes
[SPEAKER_09]: was his goal, information on how to use
bike lanes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these meetings are broadcast free to
the public on like channel 16 or 17 here
[SPEAKER_06]: locally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's trying to show the city how to
use these new bike lanes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just, he found out a free way
to get on TV and give a little educational
[SPEAKER_06]: spiel on bike lanes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys are against something that's
going, or if you need something that isn't
[SPEAKER_09]: happening to happen, if you're not getting
some good recycling in your city,
[SPEAKER_09]: go to city council and be like,
Hey, we've got a lot of trash.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should work on some recycling.
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's your passion, do whatever your
passion is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our passion is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to city council and we're
saying cannabis a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a young woman who comes down and
speaks on roadside memorials all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, half the room's in tears every
time she speaks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll give you 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you pro or are you for or against
roadside memorials?
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was a quick 30 seconds,
Adam.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they trash or are they?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I definitely wouldn't walk by and kick
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm not that kind of an asshole,
but to me, it's something that,
[SPEAKER_08]: to me, no one's been lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's hard for me to really yearn for
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every culture has a way they mourn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just because I don't understand it
doesn't mean they shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're everywhere down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, driving around and not
being used to roadside memorials,
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's not something you see all the
time in Denver, even though people have
[SPEAKER_06]: died on every street corner in Denver too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody's probably dying on a street
corner in Denver.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to shift some gears.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one more thing to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: All I got to say is that- All I got to say
is that- All I got to say is that- ... to
[SPEAKER_09]: the table, by the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Mike.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have some intelligent news coming
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my whole notes, so don't look to me
for more info.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got news too on the- I've got the
internet though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Start locally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't expect to vote for our president and
he's going to change cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I was going to go with this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your city council- It's scary that you two
were on the same side.
[SPEAKER_08]: ... has to be cannabis, pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you work from your city council
to your mayor and you try to get that dude
[SPEAKER_08]: in office.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the way Colorado did it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't start- It started in Denver and
they decriminalized it and it worked
[SPEAKER_08]: outwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is just what I know from
looking outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: With anything political, you definitely
start local.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where you generate your base and
your support.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what they're talking about when
they say grassroots political effort is
[SPEAKER_06]: going door to door and saying,
hey, stranger, what do you think about
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis laws or whatever you're
passionate about?
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's tons of that here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of people on a national
level, they think at Colorado and they
[SPEAKER_06]: think they've legalized medical marijuana
years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've legalized recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: They won.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a very real sense, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in line on January 1st with Jeff and
other people and there was a dance people
[SPEAKER_06]: were doing on the way out of the store
that they just couldn't help.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one struts and dances and shimmies
through a parking lot on their way out of
[SPEAKER_06]: Safeway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to sell medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike was for a few brief days before we
got closed down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike worked with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was Mike's boss at the only medical
marijuana center in town.
[SPEAKER_09]: I sold medical cannabis over the counter
for months and am well known for that
[SPEAKER_09]: around here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time or bliss is just something
so fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I walked out of that dispensary in January
1st after I was the first person to buy
[SPEAKER_09]: recreational cannabis at the Greener Side
Dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I walked out, I've said that so many
times, when I walked out of that
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensary, I was like, there was a camera
guy there and he goes, hey man,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're doing a documentary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you say something good when you walk
out?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, cool, watch this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I went right back in the door and I
came back out and I threw my arms up in
[SPEAKER_09]: the air and I yelled just that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I go, my name is Rasta Jeff and I was the
first person to buy recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: at the Greener Side Dispensary in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I screamed, wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that guy looked at me like,
that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was exactly what he needed for his
film.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that could be found somewhere on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: That reporter filmed stuff that they're
going to use every couple of weeks for the
[SPEAKER_06]: next hundred years that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just pulled up, you were talking and
reading news.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I was leading at is once Colorado
legalized marijuana, the fight quickly
[SPEAKER_06]: became cities and counties looking for fun
ways to ban it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, in a very real way we won,
but in a very real way now we're making
[SPEAKER_06]: the rules and drafting the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the whole world's watching
Colorado and Pueblo reports our tax
[SPEAKER_06]: numbers first.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a very real way, our tiny little
town.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say we get a lot of Texas
traffic because we're like the first stop?
[SPEAKER_08]: We get a lot of every kind of traffic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pueblo is on the way to the rest of the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: from every place out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This used to be a stop on the Santa Fe
trail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Major stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have been stopping and getting
supplies or gas here for a lot longer than
[SPEAKER_06]: any of us have been.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very true data.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very true data.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to, let's do a, do you guys
feel how much time we got?
[SPEAKER_09]: We've only got a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to see how long we've been into
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're 35 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me read a news article.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike's always bringing the good news,
but I just read news from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's kind of a neat article.
[SPEAKER_09]: This shows to me, this shows that things
are evolving and that America is starting
[SPEAKER_09]: to make changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I got from it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's positive changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says marijuana activists are already
planning the 2016 campaign to regulate and
[SPEAKER_09]: legalize the sale for recreational pot in
Nevada, home to Las Vegas, one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: world's biggest tourism destinations.
[SPEAKER_09]: But some tourists won't have to wait that
long to legally buy weed in Las Vegas,
[SPEAKER_09]: thanks to the most legal reciprocity law
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: I nailed that word.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so close.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_06]: We practiced this beforehand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tricky word.
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Words are hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need another damn it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to define it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just didn't know how to say it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could read it like a champ.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, my tongue is mad at that word.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Mike just said it for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just going to point at Mike and
he'll say that word every time it comes up
[SPEAKER_09]: from now on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Medical marijuana card holders throughout
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: will be able to purchase pot in Nevada
starting in 2015.
[SPEAKER_09]: All they'll have to do is show their
medical marijuana license, show a
[SPEAKER_09]: government ID proving they're 21 or older
and sign an affidavit, and they'll have
[SPEAKER_09]: access to that shop, but no others for
their stay in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that lead me to believe they only get
one stop when they go to Nevada?
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like you got to pick it and
stick it, homie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick one and stay with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how much are you allowed to...
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're trying to prevent smurfing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an odd way to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Will this liberal medical risk and
reciprocity... Reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering what the point was going
to look like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just came across the word.
[SPEAKER_09]: Reciprocity act as a soft lead to
recreational measures in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_09]: And will Nevada pass full-on recreational
legalization in 2016?
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course it will, said Jim Lamoureux,
who handles government relations at
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado-based pot testing facility
CanLabs, which recently announced its
[SPEAKER_09]: future present in Nevada's marijuana
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people are factoring into their
models.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he must not be able to say the word
either because he skipped it in his
[SPEAKER_09]: sentence and they put it in there in
parentheses.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: He can't say the word either.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're not alone there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the applications that went in,
people discussed it as part of their
[SPEAKER_09]: model.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can consider that Nevada has fewer
than 7,000 medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a very large base.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you factor in MMJ patients from
other states who might take advantage of
[SPEAKER_09]: Nevada system, another 110,000 from
Colorado, 570,000 from California,
[SPEAKER_09]: and 100,000 from Washington, suddenly
those numbers are looking a lot better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to mention if Missouri goes legal this
year, which they're talking about 2016.
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple other medical marijuana
states.
[SPEAKER_08]: California is going to be trying to do
legalization this year as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened in Florida?
[SPEAKER_08]: 58% is a pretty good number.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it sucks for those people that are
sick and they need it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But did we or did we not talk about this?
[SPEAKER_08]: You thought it, I don't trust Florida's
government to give them, say, okay,
[SPEAKER_08]: here's a full medical bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing can come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing can go out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be all CBD here in Florida
because we just got such banging medicine
[SPEAKER_08]: like New Jersey does.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were part of that kind of argument in
the beginning and I stuck with it,
[SPEAKER_08]: dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Florida's having all kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had CBD only legislation before this
recent medical marijuana failure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And right after the medical marijuana
amendment failed, the judge tossed their
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're back to square fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, kids.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this article says giving patients the
ability to legally access medical
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana when they're visiting a legal
medical marijuana state just makes sense,
[SPEAKER_09]: said Taylor West, deputy director of the
National Cannabis Industry Association and
[SPEAKER_09]: national trade group for legal marijuana
businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it makes even more sense when you're
talking about a state that has such a huge
[SPEAKER_09]: number of out of state visitors.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's safer for patients and good for
Nevada businesses, win-win.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would almost be like Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if you went medical and would allow
other states to come in, that dispensary
[SPEAKER_09]: right by Disney World would crush.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's been the two downsides to
medical marijuana from the beginning is
[SPEAKER_06]: it's technically illegal and you can't
travel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you're good in Colorado,
you're not good anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're good in Washington, you're not
good anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now there's some reciprocity and
that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see me in Vegas now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, now look at all the events,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret cup is going to be way bigger in
2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, 500 tickets max.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it small, nice and private.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with that sentiment, but I'd be
impressed if they keep it to 500 tickets
[SPEAKER_06]: and keep it sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_09]: The article goes on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, sure enough, Vegas sees roughly
40 million visitors annually.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: But how many of those tourists will have
valid medical marijuana cards and how many
[SPEAKER_09]: of those patients will take the time to
seek legal Nevada weed?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still talking relatively small
numbers, said Joe Hodas, chief marketing
[SPEAKER_09]: officer at Denver-based marijuana company,
Dixie Elixirs.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not as if the average tourist or
consumer can show up and make a purchase.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Red Card Act won't have, hey,
that's what they're calling it,
[SPEAKER_09]: won't have a huge impact on their tourism
because it's a small number of people,
[SPEAKER_09]: many of whom were probably already going
to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a convenience, but if I have a
red card, I can already get my medicine in
[SPEAKER_09]: my own state.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but flying with it can be sketchy
sometimes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it in your own state.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just can't take it with you to Vegas
because you've got to fly there or drive
[SPEAKER_06]: through Utah or New Mexico to get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now it sounds like you're legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you get there, you can have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what happens when it becomes under
pressure and it like explodes or
[SPEAKER_08]: something?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the TSA telling us no?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody else can change their
policies except for the people that
[SPEAKER_08]: transport everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it says, if Nevada does pass
recreational marijuana measures in the
[SPEAKER_09]: 2016 election, the earliest the state will
see those sales starting is late 2017,
[SPEAKER_09]: but 2018 is more likely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Until then, companies such as Dixie,
which hopes to soon have an agreement
[SPEAKER_09]: allowing the sale of its cannabis-infused
edibles, drinks, and topicals in Nevada,
[SPEAKER_09]: will have time to leave their mark on the
Las Vegas strip.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to ask why two years,
but after seeing what just happened in
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington where they're so unprepared for
recreational, I would almost expect two
[SPEAKER_08]: years to be right about right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give them time to grow some weed,
get the rules in place, build a
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a couple things in stock and like cure
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a funny joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: You think the dispensary is going to cure
some weed?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a funny guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Har har har.
[SPEAKER_09]: Derka derka.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Derka derka.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't review either the film we
watched.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we're headed right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: The next thing is, so guys, we'd bragged
about, Adam and I bragged recently about a
[SPEAKER_09]: couple months ago about going to see Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_09]: I ain't shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I've seen the special,
I can see why you didn't shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I was there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw Joe, Angela, myself, and Adam went
and saw Joe Rogan live at the Denver
[SPEAKER_09]: Comedy Works during the taping of his new
special that aired last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I DVR'd it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike came over here and watched it with
Angela and I.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam watched it at his place with his kind
lady.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a funny damn comedy special.
[SPEAKER_09]: They cut out a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They cut out a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you guys were saying last
night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the final product they put
together.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really, I wish I had that quality
of a video camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cameras were tiny.
[SPEAKER_09]: The camera that Rogan is staring into the
majority of the time, I'm sitting under
[SPEAKER_09]: like a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a small little thing like a of LED
screen display basically, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a great comedy show.
[SPEAKER_09]: He crushed it from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was laughing hard last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Professional one, I would say.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a good one to go to,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You hadn't gone to another show at Comedy
Works before that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never been to a professional comedy
show, like somebody TV-wise, like big
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done stuff here and it's basically
the same, but there was a lot more rules
[SPEAKER_08]: to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that was a comedy special.
[SPEAKER_08]: The taping was intense.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there were so many crowd rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were moving the crowd around and
putting ugly people in the back and sexy
[SPEAKER_09]: people up front.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course we were under camera,
so you couldn't even see us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sort of pointless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never saw a real good look at anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I was headed with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really dark.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only lights in the building were on
the stage and you couldn't even see the
[SPEAKER_09]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_09]: So all the moving around and all the rules
and the no hats and no logo shit was just
[SPEAKER_09]: too much tension.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might've applied if he had a 20 minute
bid on like picking on people in the front
[SPEAKER_06]: row or some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But all I saw was the profile of one kid a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty much all the crowd you
see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where we were for Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I kept telling him.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are three seats off to the side up
on the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: And see right next to Jeff, Jeff was
basically underneath the camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a guy sitting next to us,
but it was still wheelchair accessible.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't sloped.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he was up higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that every shot from across the way,
it basically blocked us like completely
[SPEAKER_08]: out of there because we were underneath
his shoulders basically, probably down to
[SPEAKER_08]: his elbow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a way to get on TV.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go to city council.
[SPEAKER_06]: They give you five minutes to talk live on
television.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe Rogan doesn't have to catch you in the
side view.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go be on TV for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So speaking of Joe Rogan being on a video,
shout out to Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_09]: That show was great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big respect to Melissa.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys don't know Melissa at
ComedyWorks, then you don't know what
[SPEAKER_09]: you're missing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else am I going to say?
[SPEAKER_09]: We watched a culture high tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I invited these dudes over.
[SPEAKER_09]: I rented it from iTunes, which I've never
rented anything from iTunes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels kind of weird to pay $4.99 to
watch something for 24 hours on my
[SPEAKER_09]: computer, but okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was worth my $4.99.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to take some notes.
[SPEAKER_09]: We came to a really easy conclusion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe I haven't said that yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only fucking thing I wrote
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking failed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want me to hit pause?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might just have to bleep out a name.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to say it with me?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: It deserves to be said as a group.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone should check out the culture
high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth a watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit your parents down, have them watch it
with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch it as a family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it to someone that's maybe not
open-minded, but willing to listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's one of your favorite speakers in
there?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did write down a name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was towards the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Howard Bloom.
[SPEAKER_08]: He gets crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He gets all old mannish and shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: His jowl start.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: But his message is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's your favorite doing the show,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a toss up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a huge fan of Judge James Gray.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a huge fan of Dr. Lester Greenspoon,
and they're both heavy narrators in the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ed Burns, the guy that did The Wire,
is featured in it talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Lester Greenspoon wrote life-changing
books on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's one of the researchers, I mean,
Harvard trained, works at Harvard,
[SPEAKER_06]: researching cannabis for the last,
what, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just incredible, incredible
speakers to have gathered for this
[SPEAKER_06]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep interrupting.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many years do you think, like,
he worked for, he's like ex-DI.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ed Burns.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was, I can't remember which law
enforcement agency.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a cop for a whole bunch of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a murder detective for a whole
bunch of years in Baltimore, I believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those dudes always have some stories,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like every time, like, and it's,
we have more of them that come over to our
[SPEAKER_08]: side than they, than, you know,
like the druggies clean up and go to the
[SPEAKER_08]: cops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Law enforcement against prohibition is an
awesome group that's made up fully of
[SPEAKER_06]: ex-judges, cops, detectives, DA agents
that just saw that prohibition doesn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: But harm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it might come from an interesting
place of trying to prevent drug use,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it doesn't do that at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of not being effective at all
at its main goal, it's also incredibly
[SPEAKER_06]: harmful to the society.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you're attempting to try it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can, I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It also had clips from Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw Snoop Dizzle.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw Lester Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Brian Redman was in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people might not know who that
is, but I know who he is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And shout out to Brian Redman.
[SPEAKER_09]: B-Rill was in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also, they proved- Mr. Nice was in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say who was your favorite,
but I'm- All of the above.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was just, I got attachments to
all of them because, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: just industry things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look up to a lot of those people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually show that cannabis,
scientifically, they proved that cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: does not cause schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_06]: They reminded me- I'm going to talk a lot
about that research in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that lead in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis was outlawed in 1937 and they
actually mentioned that alcohol poisoning
[SPEAKER_09]: causes 250,000 deaths per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you catch the tobacco numbers?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: 500,000?
[SPEAKER_06]: They compare it to the Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: A Holocaust around the planet every year
due to tobacco consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of not just the Jewish people,
but also of the German soldiers that died
[SPEAKER_08]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember how they broke it down,
but it's like five and a half million
[SPEAKER_06]: people around the globe die every year due
to tobacco consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: has held up as a model around the world is
the place that has pushed tobacco
[SPEAKER_06]: consumption down to record levels with
education.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really all we did is we check ID at
the point of sale and we tell every school
[SPEAKER_06]: kid, if you smoke tobacco, it will lead to
these health effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we give them the legitimate
information on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all we did.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they made a few catchy kind of
teenager commercials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, they threw a couple of
million dollars every year at like crazy
[SPEAKER_06]: teen smoking ads and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like the really effective stuff is
just sitting the kid down in health class
[SPEAKER_06]: and being like, this is your nice pink
lung.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the black lung.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember those videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to do a couple of things before we
have to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's next.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was stumbling across the Internet and
everywhere I go, there's videos of grandma
[SPEAKER_09]: smoking weed for the first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think I can play it with sound and
not get in trouble?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or should I just cut the sound out of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, for legal reasons,
you might want to hit pause, I think,
[SPEAKER_06]: just so you don't have to watch it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll watch it and I'll just keep the
volume to where we can't hear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it doesn't go to the recording.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody bring it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead and type in right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Search for grandma smoking weed for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you a second to search for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one with the three nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's three ladies, pink and purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: The three old ladies wearing pink and
purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got a purple bong in front of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the video you're searching for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get any weird parody.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to hit play right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys need a minute to catch up,
I'll give you a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm going to play on three.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, one, play.
[SPEAKER_09]: YouTube's loading.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I failed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts off with an old lady taking a
bong, taking a bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts off with another old lady taking
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't clear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just fill it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they leave it all smoky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their first timers don't judge them too
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, well, you know, I'm trying to
narrate here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a six minute video.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we can do all of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not six minutes probably, but we'll talk
through a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grandma smoking weed for the first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very well produced video.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a nice camera too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to tease the sound quality
because I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to listen to it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crank it up and just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'll watch it when I can one time,
but I don't want to get us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's the quotes that are beautiful
when the vaporizer gets down on the table.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me, let me jump in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This dude is about to light the bong for
this nice looking old lady.
[SPEAKER_09]: She pulled it closer to her face.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's showing her what's about to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's shaking the lighter cause it won't
work.
[SPEAKER_09]: She keeps shaking it when she tries to
light it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now she's toking bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's pulling a toke.
[SPEAKER_09]: She did not carve it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not enough to carve it, but they
weren't instructed to as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were instructed to do everything till
then.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this one old lady.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'd say she's probably the older of
the three.
[SPEAKER_09]: She just took a pretty nice bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: They start ripping in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, oh, she goes back for seconds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Betty white looking chick is
about to line up for a dab or for a bong
[SPEAKER_09]: rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope they had some nice munchies
after this video.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was laughing so hard the first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a lot of smoke coming out of
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what it said in the beginning was
they gave them snacks and they gave them
[SPEAKER_08]: drinks and they gave them pot or cannabis
and went with it, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's all good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to get myself taken off of
fucking iTunes, but I'm going to put some
[SPEAKER_09]: of the volume in for one minute later.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here, we want to listen to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not, I don't want to get myself in
trouble, but five minutes later.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just going to let it play.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it's a long video.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll put some clips in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go ahead and tell you basically from
memory.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're starting to feel it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grandma's getting super high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then she starts playing with it with
her second hand and the other chick is
[SPEAKER_08]: like, no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not supposed to play with your
hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and there it goes.
[SPEAKER_09]: She couldn't even do it with two hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: So 15 minutes later, we'll turn it up for
a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, they pull out a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I won't tell you what was going
through my mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of looks like a sex toy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was a dildo, but I've never
seen anything on the end of it like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The vaporizer that's been produced looks
like a dildo with a sex toy coming out of
[SPEAKER_06]: the tube.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now she's toking it.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's actually hitting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to jump in a couple of
minutes because I don't want to watch
[SPEAKER_09]: these old ladies innovate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the quotes that they say throughout
this that make it an insanely popular
[SPEAKER_06]: video.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're high now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see it on their faces.
[SPEAKER_09]: The middle old lady's eyes are just
blasted red.
[SPEAKER_09]: 35 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll give you some volume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Broadway this season blank the music.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they're just playing card games.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be the South or queefing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's queefing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Queefing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody know what that really is?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very modern word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there more terminology?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is three stoned grandmas about to
learn what queefing means.
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fooling around a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy says, since you're cool,
I'll go ahead and tell you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it just shows the definition.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of them is vaginal farting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn it back up because you want to
hear the reaction.
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't show it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's what they said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let's do that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer is something like pussyfarts
musical.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like we should be able to play it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, because this shit's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're high.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell they're visibly high,
but nothing goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are old ladies that one's got like a
damn sweater.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a shawl maybe, but it looks like a
fucking blanket wrapped around her.
[SPEAKER_09]: That lady's got a scarf.
[SPEAKER_09]: These look like lunch ladies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's videos like this that take all the
scary out of cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there at the end, the main purpose of
the story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, do we want to spoil that for
everybody or do we want them to watch?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, go and watch this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go search for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be worth your while.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's six minutes long.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to do the whole thing on
the show because we're running out of
[SPEAKER_09]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even think it's that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you guys would approve.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else did I want to do on the show?
[SPEAKER_09]: Send it to your grandma.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send it to your grandma.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah, that'd be weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send it to your grandma.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Show her that you can smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it'd be a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grandma already saw it.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's creepy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's creepy.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, we've gone just about an hour
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I approve of the movie, A Culture High.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the Joe Rogan show kicked ass.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this grandma smoking weed video
was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have some stuff to watch on
TV, if you're bored, pull up your phone,
[SPEAKER_09]: pull up your computer and watch those
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be worth your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: My Instagram on iRegenetics is getting
close to 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_09]: The end of this video says no grandmas
were harmed in the making of this video,
[SPEAKER_09]: which I think is clever.
[SPEAKER_09]: My Instagram is at 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at 9,400 and something.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could get you guys to follow and get
me up to 10,000, that'd be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's at iRegenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't ask you guys to do a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'm asking for today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam, you got any plugs?
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything you want people to follow?
[SPEAKER_09]: Any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_08]: OvergrowthGov, Twitter, Instagram,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to Bender.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting at home, working on the server
while I'm here, having fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And local, like Mike is fixing,
probably say local stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get out and do it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Local shout out stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was going to say check out the
Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Law's

[SPEAKER_06]: I don't Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't take pictures of anything but my
dogs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like people have seen other
people's dogs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they poop in weird places?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got two males and a male.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: The male's got some poop issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: If VigorLover grows mids, I just thought
I'd put that out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want some iRegenetics seeds,
pay attention to naturesgreen remedies.com

I will get them to naturesgreen remedies.

[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to start doing that part where
we close out the show.

Jesse.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a bail.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did a hell of a good job yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we were blaming Jesse.
