[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody, this is Doug Benson and
you're listening to the grow from your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart podcast hosted by my buddy Rasta
Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 861 of the grow from your
heart podcast in today's episode I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give away free seeds hang out We'll
talk more about those free seeds later on
[SPEAKER_00]: in the podcast before we get too far I do
want to let you know that the holiday sale
[SPEAKER_00]: has Begun at irie direct com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check for new stock and reduced pricing at
irie direct com whichever holiday you
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrate here in December We are
celebrating as well at irie direct com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check out that sale Pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that is all of the
advertising to do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way into some patreon
shoutouts I want to give a couple of shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs to a few great folks who support the
show on patreon Let's send a big fist bump
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend Jerome I want to
send a thank you shout out to Austin Ron
[SPEAKER_00]: and a big grow from your heart podcast
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy war possum big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of the patreon support If
you want to support the show on patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com Forward slash grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the information you need will be
right there on the screen once again Thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for all of that Patreon support ladies
and gentlemen in the last episode in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two episodes We have been talking
about grow room improvements and things we
[SPEAKER_00]: can add to our grow room that weren't
necessarily designed for grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes There were a lot of great I had a
lot of great ideas and then the audience
[SPEAKER_00]: did contribute a lot of great submissions
a lot of great ideas I have another
[SPEAKER_00]: submission here of something we overlooked
something we should have thought of as we
[SPEAKER_00]: were working on our grow room supplies
list This is a very useful idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said that we can use a gallon
Ziploc bag over a Clone and a cup as a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone dome So if you want to take one
clone, you can fill that clone that beer
[SPEAKER_00]: cup up with dirt You can moisten that dirt
Cut your clone dip it in rooting gel put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into that dirt and then use a baggie a
gallon baggie Over that as your clone dome
[SPEAKER_00]: that will work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good idea I can't believe I
did not think of that Also, I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: people use a lot of those boxes from the
container store as their own clone device
[SPEAKER_00]: their own clone environment So you can get
a plastic bin from the container store
[SPEAKER_00]: flip it upside down put the clone plugs on
the bottom part there Do all your work and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just put that bin right on top of
that that works as your clone environment
[SPEAKER_00]: can't believe I did not think of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great update there use a Ziploc baggie
over a solo cup when sprouting clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: this person said seeds I don't recommend
putting anything over the ceiling I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave them exposed because it does make
a weak ceiling if you put a dome over that
[SPEAKER_00]: but for a clone that is a wonderful idea
ladies and gentlemen, if you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas on how to Improve our grow room our
grow room experience with products We
[SPEAKER_00]: could buy not necessarily from the grow
store because all those prices all those
[SPEAKER_00]: products are overpriced Send me some
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know Put it in either you can put
it in this episode in the comments or the
[SPEAKER_00]: two previous Episodes and my favorite
comment from each episode will win a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at I
read direct calm Keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not given a deadline for those once
the comments get stale Then I will choose
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite and we will give some free
packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's stay on track here I do
have a bunch of great questions here in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me I do have a website that main
website is I read genetics calm that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where almost everything is hosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to the Discord server the
patreon link is there and there is a link
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top that says grow help or grow
questions If you click on that tab,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's over to the right is why I point this
way every time It's over to that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the screen if you click on that tab It
does give you the opportunity to send me a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow question If you send me a good grow
question and I read that question here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast I will send you a coupon code
for a free pack of seeds and I read direct
[SPEAKER_00]: calm Today's question came from somebody
that is called Hobbit from the family show
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my new friend the other
Hobbit from the family Shire We've already
[SPEAKER_00]: got another friend named Hobbit shout out
to that dude as well Family Shire Hobbit
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds and I read direct calm This is a
really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've I talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've addressed this a lot It is a very
good time to address this on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: once again It says if I had a grow we're
off to a good start and one plant got
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed and made male flowers So your
female plant got stressed And produced
[SPEAKER_00]: male flowers that is now an intersex
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a female that plant showed you
both sexes It is now determined to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has proven that to us now it says
Perhaps this intersex plant pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very likely that does happen It
says will the seeds be female and will
[SPEAKER_00]: they produce herms?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to predict what may
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have feminized seeds You did
not do anything to those seeds to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them Feminized so they are not all going
to be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will all be female You're likely to
get female seeds out of there You're also
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to get intersex seeds out of there
to expect these seeds to be all female or
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized You would have had to have done
something to them to be feminized The
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that the pollen came from was not a
true female that plant was intersex You
[SPEAKER_00]: have now technically bred with an intersex
plant to another female plant which
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly could be intersex as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother concept Maybe that
one hasn't expressed its intersex traits
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but we know one plant was an intersex
plant So it doesn't have two X's it has an
[SPEAKER_00]: X and a Y floating around somewhere giving
it that intersex expression the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant possibly could be a female it
received pollen now we've got female and
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex genes in there and that's all in
our plant mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could get more females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could get more intersex plants You
could possibly even pull a male out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what that plant that showed
its intersex expression We don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: it passed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what it did to the mix So to
think that they would all be feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: would not be accurate thinking You're
likely to get females but pay very close
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to them all the way through the
flowering phase Because at any time they
[SPEAKER_00]: could show you that they've got that
intersex trait It could be week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know, but they could be intersex
So keep an eye on that So the first part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the question was will they all be
females?
[SPEAKER_00]: That part is unlikely nothing was done to
feminize the seeds when I make Feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing something very specifically to
make those seeds be female I am feminizing
[SPEAKER_00]: them making feminized seeds This was
nothing was done here for the feminization
[SPEAKER_00]: of these seeds The next part of the
question is will they produce herms?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is quite possible because they've got
herm traits in them If you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding if you think about genetics if
you take a person with blue eyes and a
[SPEAKER_00]: person with blonde hair and a person with
brown eyes and brown hair and you breed
[SPEAKER_00]: them together that blue eyes and blonde
hair will pop up in the Offspring the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes the whatever the fuck I said in the
mixes you will see those Combos pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: within the offspring that herm trait that
you bred with is a possibility that will
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up in the offspring Just like any
other breeding trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think intersex is a trait that could be
passed down So the main questions was will
[SPEAKER_00]: they be females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will possibly intersex who knows what
else you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they produce herms quite possibly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow some of these you grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pass them out Don't give them to any
friends definitely don't sell them but you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them and see what you've created
Maybe just maybe you've got some new
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing hot fire Maybe you've created some
amazing shit on accident all of the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog stuff came from bag seed Which means
somebody bought weed that had seeds in it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they grew those seeds and found
amazing fire That's essentially what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got is bag seed in the long run
You're gonna have buds with seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna pull those seeds out You're
gonna grow them and you may find that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some amazing shit also You
could find you've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: trashy mutant intersex plants So the only
way to find out is to grow them grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself Like I said, don't share them
don't trade them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them away Don't dilute and
pollute the gene pool with them until
[SPEAKER_00]: you've grown them tested them and verified
them yourself and had fun with them I just
[SPEAKER_00]: said have fun with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That of course is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun as long as you're being ethical
You're not lying to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not messing up anybody's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not stealing money from anybody
Have a good time in the garden do what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you happy Grow from your heart breed
with love and enjoy the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, have fun That's the most
important part if it's not fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: then what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really good question got me
rambling quite well My dude hobbit from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Shire once again check your inbox
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds from irie direct
Dot-com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this momentum
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another question here in front
of me This one is from somebody who called
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves my plants talk back Bro,
if you listen they are talking just pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to what they're saying and they
will tell you exactly What they need big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my new friend my plants talk
back my dude Make sure you check your
[SPEAKER_00]: inbox and check your spam Because you've
got a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from my favorite website irie direct
dot-com Let's jump into the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey, I love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for listening It goes on it
says I need more help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what was the latest in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have had a Successful reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're talking about reversing a
female man a female plant to create
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers to use that pollen to create
feminized seeds How what is the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower you've had successful is two
weeks into flower to F and late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro You are way too F and late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had a weather issue had to go shut
down And I put everything into flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I have a banger of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, bro, you're too late when it
comes to reversing I recommend starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: week before the flowering phase with your
sprays or starting the day of flower If
[SPEAKER_00]: not, that plant will be so far into flower
You won't be able to reverse the hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it won't create any anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you won't get any pollen Also,
if your females are two weeks into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the plants that will receive the
pollen you're way shit out of luck,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro Cuz that then they're gonna be way too
far done by the time your pollen donor
[SPEAKER_00]: creates pollen They'll be dried up all the
pistols will be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not be able to receive pollen
They will not create any seeds for you So
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it but it sounds like you
might be shit out of luck for reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant There may be ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do it with silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will not work on time What I would
probably do is I would get a clone of this
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's in flower Take a couple of
clones and revege that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it in a clone dome You can put
it in the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably do the easy cloner Put a
little bit of nitrogen feed in there along
[SPEAKER_00]: with the yellow clone X the juice that
clone X sells You the yellow stuff dip it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the purple fill the clone machine with
the yellow stuff at a EC of 1.0 and a pH
[SPEAKER_00]: of Like you could do 6-2 is probably where
I'd recommend right now do 6-2 I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the exact what I would
say but 6-2 would be a good pH for that So
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a 1.0 EC 6-2 then add a little bit
of base nutrients in there just to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you that nitrogen just to speed up that
revege process then put that bad bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: under 24 hours of light if you can maybe
18 hours if that's all you could do but
[SPEAKER_00]: revege that bad bitch put some clones
under light and revege them then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get that genetic that cultivar back you
won't lose it or Simply finish out the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and revege the plant that you are
growing now I don't know what the best
[SPEAKER_00]: option is for you, but you can definitely
however far into flower You are with a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant you can cut a clone and you can
revege that bad bitch and you can save
[SPEAKER_00]: those genetics Or you can let it finish
and then you can revege it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a quick revege chat right now I'm
not gonna go too far Harvest time comes
[SPEAKER_00]: right cut off all the top parts of the
plants at the bottom here You got a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of buds the size of my thumb You got a
branch coming up a branch coming up leave
[SPEAKER_00]: some buds like about the size of my thumb
Leave leaves on that bud leave leaves on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud I mean to say that word twice you
want foliage on there because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to receive the light That's where
the hormones will develop that is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make that bud Revege itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leave some foliage on a bud You got two
or three three or five little bottom buds
[SPEAKER_00]: on a plant leave some leaves on there Let
this fucking like it to those leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: give them 18 hours 24 hours if you can If
that plant is root bound put it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pot It'll happily speed up your
process if you put that root bound pot
[SPEAKER_00]: plant into a larger pot Let the roots
spread some plants will just flower simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are too tightly root bound So
give it some legs give it some room to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread Have just a few bottoms there then
put it under the 18 six or 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light Then you'll see in about it'll take
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take you two three,
maybe four weeks You'll start getting new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth coming out of the top of that bud
stuff will just start coming out of The
[SPEAKER_00]: top of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna look wonky and twisted and
world and it's gonna look like it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: sad But it's gonna work out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll keep growing It'll grow it'll work
itself out of that weird twisted shit And
[SPEAKER_00]: then one day will just spit out a perfect
little shoot that looks like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: clone Let that grow let that happen till
you got two or three of those so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck around and find out Then take one of
those clones two of those little shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's spitting and clone those I know
that sounds wild but put that in a cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: and get those to root now use those new
shoots that you've just cloned As your new
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants, that's your new mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that grow out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that cultivar security You can
cut clones from there Feed that plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: basic veg diet like you would your mom's
maybe boost up the nitrogen a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the quick version of revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I covered all that because that was
spontaneous I did not have any notes that
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided that I would tell you that
now Revege is pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to be patient That's really
all it takes lights and patient give it
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of light give it a bigger pot and
give it some patience and it will I will
[SPEAKER_00]: revege on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're too late with your
reversal to be honest with you I hate to
[SPEAKER_00]: bust your bubble, but I did give you some
backup plans a couple of different options
[SPEAKER_00]: cut some clones get those clones reveged
or simply revege that big old mama plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working with or Suck it up
because you got a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from IRE direct comm and you could
just grow those my dude Make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: check the spam folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thank you for the great
question Alright, I've got some good
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another question here in front of
me I've got a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the one that I wanted to get
to Alright, this one's been cooking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while this one came from somebody
who wants to be called ham Biscuit ladies
[SPEAKER_00]: and gentlemen big shout out to my friend
ham biscuit If you want your question
[SPEAKER_00]: right here on the podcast go to the I read
genetics website I read genetics comm on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of that website There's a row of
tabs one does say grow help click on that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow help tab Send me your question if I
read your question, guess what free seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: ham biscuits question goes like this it
says from the time of Seed breaks the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you start to feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question when I see
my friend this Let me give a disclaimer if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've put your plant into soil that's got
High nitrogen or a lot of nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil like some amended soil or a
store-bought soilless mix That's got that
[SPEAKER_00]: brags about having its listed to have an
NPK value Sometimes those plants can go
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little while without being fed that
is up to you If you want to turbo feed
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant if you want to let that plant
live off of what's in that Soil some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those soilless mixes claim to be good for
two to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say six weeks I don't ever let them
go that long without feeding in that
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix But before we go too far keep
in mind that some of your soil Soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes will be pre fed and that's got to
come into play You've got to adjust that
[SPEAKER_00]: to my response here But usually within the
first two to three weeks when I see the
[SPEAKER_00]: first true leaves pop up Then I pay
attention then I'll probably feed right
[SPEAKER_00]: when I see those first leaves spread out
sometimes I'll wait for the second set if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in like a hot soil And then I'll just
pay attention to the plant the first sign
[SPEAKER_00]: of yellowing then it will get fed But it's
usually the first two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix up a nitrogen a basic base feed
Sometimes I'll feed it a bean sauce give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a little bit of microbes a little bit
of phosphorus a little bit of potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to get that little tiny plant growing
a little bit more quickly But that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: just that's advanced growing stuff if
you're asking this wait two to three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the soil or soil is mixed
what you are playing with then we got A
[SPEAKER_00]: follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you plant directly into your soil or
medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do a paper towel germination sort of
thing Sometimes I float the seeds in water
[SPEAKER_00]: for 12 to 24 hours before most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do that I fold up a paper towel
into a square and I soak it with water and
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it on a plate and I tip It's where
the excess water runs off unfold it put
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds in there fold it back up and
then I put that in a warm dry dark place
[SPEAKER_00]: and usually within 24 hours my seeds
sprout Then I put them in a usually a beer
[SPEAKER_00]: cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I use a solo cup Just like a
party cup that you'd use to play flippy
[SPEAKER_00]: cup or beer pong Shout out to all the
flippy cup gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who I'm talking about I fill that
cup with soil soilless mix pat it down
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I water it before I even put my
seedling into there water it then I put
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little indention Just just about a
knuckle deep is all I really go boink Just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little press put my seedling in there
and then just gently press dirt right on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it And then just press that under
or put that under the light usually under
[SPEAKER_00]: a small Led or a t5 give it 18 6 maybe 24
hours a white usually 18 6 for the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings But that's the quickest
germination into a cut method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could teach you right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay focused You didn't even ask
about that part The question does go on it
[SPEAKER_00]: says the reason I ask is because I have
used several methods successfully But I do
[SPEAKER_00]: get more helmet heads with the paper towel
method I flipped my golden goat to 12 12
[SPEAKER_00]: this past Sunday and it's looking super
happy Bro, congrats on flipping the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see those photos So he's talking
about helmet head Let me describe what
[SPEAKER_00]: helmet head even is here on the podcast
before we talk too much about it helmet
[SPEAKER_00]: head Let's talk about helmet head a little
bit here a lot of times when you plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed it will pop up through the soil or
the soil is mixed when it pops up a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times it should have two little miniature
leaves that want to spread open and get
[SPEAKER_00]: life started a lot of times the seed will
get stuck on one of those little parts and
[SPEAKER_00]: it will not spread properly and a lot of
people really freak out they have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: panic attack about that there is A little
bit of debate on what causes that some
[SPEAKER_00]: people will tell you that you're planting
the seed too deep And some people will
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you you're not planting the seed deep
enough So there's a couple of schools of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I want you guys in the comment
section Please leave me your opinion your
[SPEAKER_00]: bro science your real science your
edumacated Factual input on why we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting helmet head when we plant our
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the main cause of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will tell you it's too deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will tell you it's too
shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Am not certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna leave it up to the comment
section What I can tell you is it's real
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to remove it is very simple to remove
that helmet head I've seen a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods somebody told me a real
fun method of it the other day which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about so what I like to do I get a
spray bottle with just plain water in it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will get real close and just spray
that ceiling just Just spray it real good
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of aggressively to be honest put some
mist into it then what I'm trying to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisten that helmet head to soften the
helmet and also add some lubrication
[SPEAKER_00]: between that Leaf and the seed shell so
that I can get some tweezers and just
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly pluck that helmet head right off
of there Don't pull hard enough to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're lifting up the seed and yanking it
all the way out of the dirt You don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that gently remove it just
scientifically surgically get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: just real gently Spray it with water and
pull it off of there another method that a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend recently told me that they do they
spray it with water But then they do the
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards version of what I do They take
the tweezers and put it inside the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: shell and let the tweezers open on their
own because the tweezers will
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically pop open It's their default
is open and they will pop that seed shell
[SPEAKER_00]: open far enough and then the seed shell
will just fall off So that's a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways to deal with helmet head
But what I want is comments you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let me know what is causing the
helmet head on my new and our friends new
