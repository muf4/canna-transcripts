[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 115 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting the show off trying not to
cough already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Hitman Glass for helping
us with the coughs over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, guys, I need to send a huge
thank you shout out to my friends in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic Roots band for letting me use their
music on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are all having a great
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you got the email on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you got a dab out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you got the vaporizer going.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you got some edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're smoking a blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're in the hood getting down on a
blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Across from me is my good friend,
Carlos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me, Carlos.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my left over here is my buddy,
Alan.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start the show off with a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your favorite way to consume
cannabis, Alan?
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like an old joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an old joint?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you, Carlos?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to dab an old joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: An old joint, but you like to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm torn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm torn.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started off loving an old school bong
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember back in the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most gigantic bong I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the bong in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be the bong guy and now
everybody knows me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember back when you were doing the
bong with the hot plate and the dabs on
[SPEAKER_03]: the bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the skillet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Big D from Broadway Wellness
who sold me my very first real dab rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first cannabis cup when I first
got that old, the dub tube with the little
[SPEAKER_02]: swing arm skillet on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I evolved quickly from bong right into the
hash and I like to take like half gram
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs out of a nice Hitman rig,
which that's a good way to work into this
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I like to buy a new rig, I like to
shop in an American store and buy an
[SPEAKER_02]: American product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to buy a rig made by an American
person, not a Chinese kid with no
[SPEAKER_02]: protective eyewear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese kid not getting paid a real wage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want something made in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy an American.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitman rigs are made by dabbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys dab as hard as you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my buddy Dougie at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow at Hitman Glass
Dougie on Instagram and also visit www
[SPEAKER_02]: .HitmanGlass.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, Hitman is a great company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I support them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you should check out the Chalice
Festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to be in California this
summer, the Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the slogan there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash music and art.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could be better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash music and art, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to go to the Chalice
Festival with me in California?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over the 7-10 weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go out to California,
get down at Chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get out there this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what could happen in Rob's
Did Jeff's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Rob from the Sour Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I hope you're doing better,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob had a health scare.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was supposed to be on the show tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get him back in the very near
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, take good care of yourself,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love from everybody at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love from the whole irie genetics and
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole team, the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, get better, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You told me that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sincerely worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're second that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody here has got this somber
look on their face now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went from having fun and taking dabs
to, oh shit, what's wrong with Rob?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all your fault, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of put together an impromptu
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called my friends over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, my guests bailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, help me out with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got Carlos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Alan here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about a few random
things before I get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to let you guys know the stickers
from the hashtag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it when you ramble Twitter
campaign, whatever that was called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those stickers should have landed at your
door.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you participated in that, check your
mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have some stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an email I want to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm prepared, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise somebody sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, hey, now just wanted to drop a
note and say how much I loved episode 112
[SPEAKER_02]: or how I got into the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, great story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to the Grow focused shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy also says he's waiting to hear if
he gets hired for a job in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dude, I really wish you good luck on
the job in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, thanks for listening and thanks
for the kind words about episode 112.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like hearing from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes all the effort I put into this
show super worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you guys got to do is say thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got an email you'd like to send
to me, it's growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_02]: .com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm telling you about the email,
the last episode was all about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had our friend Fox from Foxtracks come
on to talk about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: A friend of mine told me that that episode
made her cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry and you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's making you cry, we're doing
something right, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got questions from the CBD
episode, I encourage you to email me those
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and I will get Fox back on the
show and we will do round two of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our first topic that I wanted to bring
up on social media lately, there have been
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of crazy pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys seen the picture of the
super clear shatter that that guy posted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I seen that picture of a super clear
shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn your face toward the mic a little
more, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get you in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how good you sound?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, much better now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got that awesome voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that picture that was going around
on Facebook of the super clear shatter and
[SPEAKER_03]: that was just, I couldn't even believe
that right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know exactly how they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to tell you how they did
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they put, so actually nature put a
puddle of water on the hood of somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: car and then it got really cold outside
and they picked it up and they carried it
[SPEAKER_02]: inside and held it in front of a vac oven
with gloves on and took a picture of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and posted it to the social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just a piece of ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, when they saw the vac oven and
the rubber gloves, everybody on social
[SPEAKER_02]: media just went, oh shit, look at this
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ice hash is all that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that right off the bat too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there's no way that's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They let that ride for a few days,
but then they went and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody, it's just ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out for fooling everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have pulled up the Twitter
account, the Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag hoax.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys were blown away by that
super clear hash that was held up a few
[SPEAKER_02]: days ago on Instagram, a lot of people
were reposting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all over Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all over the social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was frozen water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make hash that clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing it in the freezer right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably if you live in the right part of
the country, it's happening in your
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard right now somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do it in Pueblo tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going on right here in our
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry to burst every body's bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just a piece of ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another social media thing that has
been really catching a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_02]: lately, there was a glass convention in
Las Vegas just recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that was Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there's a glass convention,
an industry convention where a mothership
[SPEAKER_02]: rig, a Sagan and Scott Debbie collab sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I want you to sit down before I
tell you how much this rig sold for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're driving, you might want to pull
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're at work, put down your knife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody bought a hash rig for $101,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even believe that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly overpaid by a grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an auction style.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other guy was like, a hundred G's
and this guy's like a hundred and one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they gave it to him for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of money for a hash rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much hash do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: You better be smoking the best hash ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember correctly, when I was
looking at, did it have a, it had a flower
[SPEAKER_03]: bowl set up right up on it right away?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually a mothership honey
bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a big bowl, but the skillet
swings in and out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does look like a big fat bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like that you said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open up that flood gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say this on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 5,000 people are going to listen to
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure at least a hundred of them
are going to send me dirty emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: That rig is fucking ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: $101,000 for a really ugly rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm no, you know, I'm a connoisseur on
many other things as it comes to weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers, connoisseur oil and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that rig was, man, it was,
it was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like, so it's, it's got a gaudy
ass base.
[SPEAKER_02]: The base is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I should mention,
this rig is covered in moons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you turn the rig around slowly,
it goes through the phases of the moon is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that Debbie pointed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Debbie, shout out to Scott Debbie
and to Sagan glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I just think it's ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously enough people love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be mad at me for thinking it's
ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, somebody paid $101,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's obviously not ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One person loved a lot, loved the shit out
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more than I hated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves it 101,000 times more than I
dislike it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's ugly, but it's poorly
planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The base is God awful ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got moons glued to it on the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in this odd shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the base was just,
they made the top and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we need something big enough to hold
this up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they made that gaudy base and then they
put a, I think the color would be called
[SPEAKER_02]: stardust black stardust Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you guys know anything about glass,
the fab egg is the artwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way to go, but they made it out
of a color of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't see through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could barely tell that it's a fab
egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a grenade.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any way you can pull up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a picture here on my phone
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted it up to social media,
so it shouldn't be too hard to find,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we will pull this up for you to take a
look at, but it looks like poorly planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it looks like they just glued
moons around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give it the moon vibe that they were
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said that I wanted to buy it and
just glue a rocket to it just to complete
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole space theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the, Oh look, there was the image
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give me a minute to find the image.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause Facebook likes to do that thing
where it jumps around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pulling it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a rig that somebody paid $101,000
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some great colors to it,
but it looks like something that Les
[SPEAKER_02]: Claypool or Tim Burton would have put
together in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mothership is known for a really
clean, sleek, smooth, tight baller status.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, their rigs are gorgeous and clean
and perfect and flawless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this thing, this doesn't come close.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're seeing, I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan's not really into the glass scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't, he hasn't mentioned anything
about glass in the time that I've known
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's out of the loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it looks cool, but he just
doesn't, he already knows that that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't fit the mothership motto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, mothership, I'll give you guys a shout
out though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those new race car themed rigs are the
bee's knees, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I really, really love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm doing too much,
uh, pulling up stuff on the phone here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll show you guys these race car rigs
because they are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can do editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If any of this gets carried away,
hit me or mothership these rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to describe it now since
I'm pulling it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they took a normal Taurus rig,
which would be clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have used yellow glass on one
portion and blue glass on another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks really sleek and it's super
smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they call it the race car series.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Klein and where the Klein
function happens, they used clear glass to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a window so that you can see the
water bubble in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love the race car series.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to mothership glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not like that expensive piece,
but I really love the race car series.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize for bashing it with the,
with the clear window.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a tight look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that rig levitating in that picture?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems rig is levitating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wondered if I was the only one that
noticed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you made that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should probably stop talking about
mothership since I'm sponsored by hitman
[SPEAKER_02]: glass by yourself, a hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all agree that that rig was way
overpriced, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody at this table does
financially well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all kind of in the legal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, what's the most money that you
would find acceptable to pay cash for a
[SPEAKER_02]: rig at this point in your life?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd pay a good 150 bucks for a good 150.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to go to a trade show
and pick up a hitman because that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: only way you're going to find one for that
price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone gives me shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They break.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke cash out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: At two 50, I think you're going to go two
50 and you're not a dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I'm guessing you're going to buy a
nice bong or a good pipe at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, I want you to send me a tweet,
uh, to, uh, at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell me right now, if you're going to
buy a rig, what you would find to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in the $101,000 range or are you
over here like Carlos with $150 rig?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using a hitman e-series sidecar in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, say about this at illusions
glass in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a $550 rig at that point in
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's not, I don't think it's worth
that at this point, but it was at that
[SPEAKER_02]: time, uh, in front of me here is the shout
out to hitman glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, the, I would put down two 50
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one on their website is 800 for the
short stack.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess hitman sent this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you won that lottery, if you won the
lottery by two of those, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have that ticket and the power
ball in my, they have to check out,
[SPEAKER_03]: have to check out those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you, uh, I'm glad you came here
and recorded a podcast before you checked
[SPEAKER_02]: out your power ball numbers, because if
you won that, I would not have seen you
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would be calling me from Costa Rica
like, Hey bro, um, can we reschedule that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, something that I want to,
I wanted to talk about since everybody at
[SPEAKER_02]: the table, uh, is into the legal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you were kind of making, I should,
we should back up and talk about kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: how we ran into each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have known you since I was the budtender
at Medamar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been such a long time, but that was
2008 when we got closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were one of our first patients that
would come in and buy medicine from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you came, did you come in when it was
in the apartment upstairs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to see it evolve from,
from that guy's couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't talk about that guy's name on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We leave names out to protect the
innocent, but it went from that guy's
[SPEAKER_02]: couch and then it went to the middle floor
and then we moved it down to the main
[SPEAKER_02]: floor and then we busted out and went
hardcore for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2008 is when that shop was really booming,
2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, 2008 is how long I've known this
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he used to shop at the dispensary,
which Tom Sexton pretty much handed the
[SPEAKER_02]: keys to me and was like, here you go,
run this shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, since then we've both gotten into,
if that shop was legal, quasi legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how legal that shop was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We called it the wild, wild west.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing herb at the house and Tom
was growing herb at the house and we would
[SPEAKER_02]: take it and put it on the shelves and then
customers would show up with a backpack
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'd know, they'd be like,
I just need to talk to Jeff and they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: send them back and they'd come talk to me
and they'd be like, look at all this weed
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys want to buy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was good enough and they wanted a
reasonable price, we could buy the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And put it on the shelves at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the good old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the herb was a little bit better
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boutique batches are much better than
these large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I work in a large scale girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a different type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a totally different monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: The airflow is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things I've noticed
about everything is the commercial grows
[SPEAKER_03]: are just, oh my God, they're just,
it seems like I can't believe how weed
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the day was so much better and it
was just people working with almost no
[SPEAKER_03]: budget compared to people who have
millions, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, and a lot of that is because the
passion, the industry evolved,
[SPEAKER_02]: the rules evolved to where only people
with a million dollars can play in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis game right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a million dollars to get
involved in the cannabis game,
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a legal shop and to grow a grow
that supports that shop, to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: open and have a clean environment to build
your grow and a retail environment and to
[SPEAKER_02]: hire a staff and to get product and to get
insurance and to get security.
[SPEAKER_02]: Security is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so expensive to open any type of
anything, uh, marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: division regulated every square foot where
people can go needs to be covered by a
[SPEAKER_02]: camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a doorway, they want a camera
on both sides of the door so that if they
[SPEAKER_02]: look at two camera views on the monitor,
they can see you leave one room and enter
[SPEAKER_02]: the other room flawlessly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be no gaps in your travel on the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it costs you a million bucks to get
into the industry nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what sucks about that is people like
you and I, we have heart, we got mad
[SPEAKER_02]: heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we should even admit we were
growing in our basements, we were getting
[SPEAKER_02]: it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've got heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a million dollars because we
had to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to, we were growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't going to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't running a car dealership.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't doing whatever these other guys
are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to make our own money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that we've got it, uh,
your headphones are right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tap them.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tap them and they'll start working.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, maybe I'll wiggle the cable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a great voice, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you over the headphones.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good too.
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You good?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's his headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine just went on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever buy the HA04 headphone
amplifier from Livewire.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a guitar center and they offer
you that, uh, give them a dirty look and
[SPEAKER_02]: buy the one that's $20 more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be well worth your time guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a million dollars,
you can't get into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Los and I, Carlos and I have mad
passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't be able to buy a shop right
now and set that up because we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: growing weed and living like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to kind of hide when you're a
cannabis grower back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: we couldn't have all the money that we
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to hide that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't go open a store because we
couldn't talk about, how'd you make this
[SPEAKER_02]: money?
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to kind of be on the down low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people that are able to open shops
now are guys that have had other
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses that were doing other things
and no offense to those guys, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have the heart that somebody like
you and I have about the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a business to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they have an accountant and a lawyer
and then the master growers are the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that are just supposed to go grow their
employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to point this at your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound better when he's talking to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I was kind of getting at a little
bit is right now, master growers and head
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, I'm called a lead cultivator is
my official title.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated the word master grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lead the cultivation team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making hella good money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're being paid fat chunky salaries
as lead cultivators in this industry right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that have been at it for,
I've been growing cannabis for over 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been involved in the cannabis
industry or the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: For wow, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been messing with weed for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys, there's a big difference
between being like a weed grower and a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis caregiver and being in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not paying taxes on it and you
don't have some kind of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: any deregulated license, you can't say
you're in the industry in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just growing weed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of the new standard we're going
to make here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say I do this in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay taxes, do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm saying is the people that own
the industry, they have all kinds of money
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the people like myself that are
making good money, we better stick to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We better make a fat resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys that are trimming, I know
trimmers that make anywhere between 10 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making good money trimming,
start documenting how many hours you've
[SPEAKER_02]: been trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a trim machine,
if you're using the satellite,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're using the ripper, document how
many hours you use on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that as part of your resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know how, if you're applicator
certified, that goes on your resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in the future, this is going to
turn into just a basic job, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like Alan said over here,
it's a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's headed that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Owners aren't going to want to pay the
next set of growers my salary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that come after me are not
going to get paid what this group of
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to start tapering off because
what I think creates a high dollar product
[SPEAKER_02]: is an illegal product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it was illegal, it was highly in
demand, but there wasn't any supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could grow the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we charging so much for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only for production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we catch up with production,
which won't take too long, we're building
[SPEAKER_02]: their greenhouses going up every single
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we catch up with production,
I see prices going down and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: producers are going to start being paid
less and less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trimmers aren't going to get hired on for
15 an hour anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry is going to taper off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be any other agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find more temporary staffing going
on it, probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting back to the leaf cultivator,
like any industry, I do believe that if
[SPEAKER_04]: you can show someone that you are worth
your money, you can get a higher wage for
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can go in there and you can
increase production and show them that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can do it, you can bring it up 10,
15, 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll still have a competitive edge over
someone else to be able to present that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make good recommendations of
absolutely documenting your history and
[SPEAKER_04]: what you've been able to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to make a lot of difference as
this industry does change.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works in any industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Document what you're doing, have proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just harder in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we are revolving, a lot of guys like
us, we're ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay ahead of the game and document that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get stuck in your bubble and write
down everything that you're learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes on a resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, if you can use the satellite,
that goes on your resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can use the OBDOS, that goes on
your resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can run a sweet leaf extractor,
that goes on your resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, you guys, you're not going to
... Allen brought up a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can impress them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can jump in and make a few more
dollars on your salary, but a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: jobs are taken by guys like us that got a
jump on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the next wave of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the rock stars are doing that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to be a badass to get
that salary in the future, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you on that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going to come down to
networking too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked in other industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Networking was important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have those crossover
relationships, but nothing like this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry have I ever experienced where
it's so ... I'll use the word incestuous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to know someone in a lot of
instances to get in the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I was pretty fortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got hired on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only been in the industry about eight
months now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've been badged.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked at a couple other facilities,
starting at the ground level, literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did walk into one place.
[SPEAKER_04]: With my crossover skills and my resume,
I was able to get in there, but I've had
[SPEAKER_04]: to work and hustle to learn this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does matter a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can name drop a little bit,
I think it helps a tremendous amount more
[SPEAKER_04]: so in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can completely testify to your
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not be in the position I'm in if I
weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I earned it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I earned the spot, but if I did not know
Grimy Gatsby, if I wasn't tight with Hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was, I would not have found my
spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I am, he was my homie from before he
had a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When things went wrong, he called me right
away, like, you can grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out and join the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you were bringing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can join some other clubs or
anything like that, some social groups
[SPEAKER_04]: that are- I think just getting out and
getting your badge first is always- Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: first and foremost- Go get your badge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your badge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the very first thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a brief episode on how to get your
badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should do a complete in-depth episode on
how to get your badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make a note of that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do this in the phone here,
since it's right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode about badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, I'll do a full episode on
how to get your badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do a little update thing for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are new, kind of fairly new to
the legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about what you guys are doing
or is that- Would you like to keep some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that quiet for now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't mention who I'm with because I
don't think it's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just in quality control, trimming,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd mentioned dropping the master.
[SPEAKER_04]: Master grower and lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trimmer is the last- Well,
not the last person, but one of the last
[SPEAKER_04]: people to see what that product is going
to be like when it gets out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you get your hands in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has turned into more of a quality
control issue in the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you hear that forward thinking,
you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we need in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are quality control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're inspecting my buds that I handed to
you to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the last eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to look at them before we
put them in a jar and customers touch
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be- What did I call that the
other day on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would I call that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Flaw inspector.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flaw inspector.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for anything that we may have
overlooked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find it for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last eyes before it hits the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a forward thinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to come join the cannabis
industry, just like he's saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not just trimming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not staring into the buds all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are making sure they are beautiful so
that when I put them in the jar and the
[SPEAKER_02]: patients come in, they go, oh,
who trimmed that black cherry Kim?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to smoke it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially on the hand trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun skill to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a lot of technique and it can be
boring, but you have some great
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations over the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: You meet such a wide variety of
personalities in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been out doing other industries,
real estate for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually find that I'm always the
minority at the table and I'm the native.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always find that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always find that out to be everyone else
is from out of state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, everybody's moving to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's moving here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting a little crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to get the rents going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting a little bit full.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an abundance of labor for the
market, so it is competitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so work on your skills and work
on, uh, work on getting to know people in
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry where someone will give you a
chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then like every other thing, show up and
do your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not a place where you just
sit around and party or I think there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people that want to get into the
industry because they think it was like
[SPEAKER_04]: high school where everybody just sits
around and toks around the table or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like that, but, uh, I'm the lead
cultivator and I will send you the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: home if you're playing with your phone,
if you're standing over there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: corner, like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple of pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple of pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand, but take your pictures right
before, right after your shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you can do it and walk in and take
them or finish up, take them, but don't
[SPEAKER_02]: plush fun every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't text your girlfriend all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do some shit while you're in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just be walking around smelling
plants and sniffing your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 300 plants and 85 lights in one
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I called you over for a few hours
of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need you to work, not play with your
phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in the industry, appreciate
your position.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, start taking notes of everything you
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Document all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, make sure you're getting paid a fair
wage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, kind of pay attention to the way that
the market in this industry is going and
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that you are getting a
competitive wage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bring it to your employer's attention
that you can now run an OB dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can now run a satellite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that all that shit is noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you're getting paid for what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you're coming to join the industry,
I would say get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even waste time with a support
badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're worth more money with the key
badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll testify to that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been going about a half hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you guys want to take some dabs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan's never taken a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you interested in taking a first dab
on a podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: No pure pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to twist his army guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to smoke some of this lemon G.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should ask a question to get you guys
going, but I didn't think of a good
[SPEAKER_02]: question yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already talked about, so what do you
think of this whole concentrate scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're new here to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been up here a year and a year in
December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so you've come a long way in just a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: See this guy's a go getter.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't sit on the couch and fuck around
when he got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would encourage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, everyone else out there that's going
to do this, you know, treat it like it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, uh, yeah, it's certainly
using a product that's always been
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with, you know, good times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want everybody to get the
medicinal, uh, help out of it that they
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the rec, uh, you know,
people that just want to use it for,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, enjoyment that it brings us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're on the job, it's a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make sure that all of those
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Components work or it'll be a short lived
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cash register has to come out right at
the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that if you're too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think of this whole hash
scene and the way that we all just smoke a
[SPEAKER_02]: shit ton of hasher?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it like that at all in Arizona or is
that just kind of a Colorado thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, uh, I wasn't in the industry
down there, so I couldn't tell you how
[SPEAKER_04]: much, uh, how much people were,
uh, what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys enjoy it up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if I was going to get Alan to
smoke some hash right now, it'd probably
[SPEAKER_03]: have to be some, like some, some bubble
hat or some, like some bubble hash or some
[SPEAKER_03]: ice hash or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got crumble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 9,000 different kinds of hash
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, you know, like the old
school stuff, you know, like don't peer
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, I need the rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the dabber with a dab on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No peer pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of a quiet guy anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start, uh, him and our buddy Ernie is,
uh, he's come across as very well-spoken
[SPEAKER_02]: and very intelligent so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let him, uh, continue that
reputation on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't turn him into a bubble or a
puddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't do that to him on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to twist his arm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm heating up the highly educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this one's the duality nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I do have to say, I used to,
when I participated when it wasn't legal,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, as a younger man, uh, I had one of the
old Hobbit bongs that I used to smoke my
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff at a wonderful ex-wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now she's wonderful because she's an ex.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what this is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love you the glass where they have
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to sit here, you don't have to
really smoke, uh, to appreciate the art or
[SPEAKER_04]: the craftsmanship in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is really, pardon me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you can see why someone who has the
budget may spend the money on one,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, uh, art is subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and it, it's not, uh, jumping back to
what we're talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I'm sitting here looking at what
you have on the table, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's three beautiful pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, two hit mans and then a piece from
elevate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's so trippy how glass has
changed the microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's so trippy how glass has
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, when maybe the last 10 years,
I remember, uh, just going into the glass
[SPEAKER_03]: shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like, so, so, you know,
and then now this just seems like the
[SPEAKER_03]: glass shops have just exploded with all
the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dab dab scene and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about being a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I caught myself falling into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you harvest, you have too much money
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like any young guy that has too much
money and a big ego and shit going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to go buy something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't do the gold chains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do rims on my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing I like to do is smoke hash
and listen to good music.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a slam in stereo system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got really good headphones on and I've
got really nice hash toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's every harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go buy something ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this was one of my first good
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about those,
like a harvest that I grew this one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just drew some extra herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm going to set up this room
and that extra room bought me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That rig was pretty much what I pulled out
of their extra, you know, so stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to go buy a rig instead
of buying rims and gold chains and
[SPEAKER_02]: jerseys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, Hey, if gold chains and Air
Jordans are your thing, fucking rock them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have a hit man rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come hit my rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll look stylish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not worried about looking that
style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like skate shoes and Dickies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and easy for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's the new one that you got there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called the hit man short stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the one we're hitting a little
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out again to hit man Dougie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Ryan at hitman glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Ryan, I got the rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to tell you when I got
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to send you that email,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of clogged up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I could talk about how to
clean your rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good, that is a good chunk in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably a half gram of just bust.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to dissolve it really
well with rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get you some 91% isopropyl alcohol and
just fill the rig up as high as you can
[SPEAKER_02]: with alcohol and let it sit for a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pour a little bit of kosher salt
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the kosher salt's real rough and then
shake the shit out of the rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover the holes with your thumbs and shake
the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't drop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it over the carpet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it over the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like you're clumsy and just
shake the fucking shit out of it and it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: scrub it up real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then rinse it with hot water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do that, you're going to get a lot
of dirt in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few times, let it cool off and then
you're ready to dab again if you do it
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually one of the things I
noticed is if you give it a decent,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That piece is a pretty intricate,
but I noticed that once when you're done,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you want to leave it nice and streak
free, you give it another rinse with the
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol and let it dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get a nice polish it up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a super good tip right there for
all you glass nerds when you're done
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning your rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Carlos got a lot of good tips for
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a sharp guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that you're comfortable with the
headphones and the mic, we'll have you
[SPEAKER_02]: back on for another show and I'll have
like stuff written down for you because
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll talk about how you grow and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how you grow, but we'll let you
teach the listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we've been going for like 33
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything else that you want to say
to, I'm going to let you guys know now
[SPEAKER_02]: that the show is toward the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: When this comes out within 48 hours of
this episode being posted, 5,000 people
[SPEAKER_02]: will download and listen to this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll come out on a Monday, by Tuesday at
midnight, 5,000 downloads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are going to hear all
the stuff you had to say today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wait till the end of the show to tell
people how many people are going to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got anything you want to say
to that many people, now's your chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microphone is on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do, I don't do shout outs or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't have anybody to represent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always encourage people to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you get out there and support
the people that are supporting this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whatever it is, if it's a
politician, make sure that they have your
[SPEAKER_04]: interest at heart and get out there and
support those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very wise words.

for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be a very fun episode to good
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may get Rusty from CannaVenture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he's available, he has to travel an
hour to get here, but if he can come,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we can all match up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three well-known seed breeders
here.

the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where it is, so we're just
going to go like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, remind me to ask him.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to select a male for some seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, not now, but I have to get
into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the wheel rolling in that direction.
