[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to call these Thursday episodes,
the Thursday Quickie.
[SPEAKER_02]: These Quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check them out at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
Quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get on with the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show and thanks again for
joining me podcast world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a quick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to let you guys know what I'm
smoking on to start the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I am smoking on some cantaloupe
haze batter from our friends at the Garden
[SPEAKER_02]: of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a super sweet cantaloupe smell,
a really nice cantaloupe flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the look and texture of this are just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I keep saying cheesecake,
but it's like cheesecake or cream cheese
[SPEAKER_02]: with a golden yellow color, and then the
edges of it have just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: turps seeping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friends at the Garden of
Whedon for the great cantaloupe extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been making my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move forward and get into some
iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love ratings and reviews on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have got, let's scroll up and see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of them here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using the iPad, so it's not as easy as
it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 97 ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, everybody has given me a five-star
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'd like to give me a review,
they've made it real easy now.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're listening to the podcast,
if you're on iTunes, scroll down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: available episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, it'll show you the ratings and
reviews right there in the podcast app,
[SPEAKER_02]: right where you're looking at my show,
right at my home screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just scroll down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go there, and you can write a rating
and a review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, like I said, everybody is giving
me a five-star rating, and so far,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody has written quite a positive
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure if I read this last one
here on the show or not, so we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they gave me five stars, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from a person that calls themselves
Rogers1023, and he says, or they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like all the good books out there,
including all the Jeff Lowenfeld's teaming
[SPEAKER_02]: books, your stories and insight help in so
many ways for first-time growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs up to your guests, also,
for all the insight, for all the info they
[SPEAKER_02]: share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs up to Jesse, too, for all of the
info he shares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feels like I might have read that,
but I'm not sure, so big shout out to our
[SPEAKER_02]: friend Rogers1023 for the great customer
review, and of course, the five-star
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna move right into the next
customer review.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is left by a person that calls
themselves Growgang420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Growgang420.
[SPEAKER_02]: They follow me on Instagram, also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, best cannabis information out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a five-star review,
or a five-star rating, and the review goes
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very informative, and he makes sure to do
his homework and not give out any false
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm glad you noticed that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to be really careful to not steer
you guys in the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would make me feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where else was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit, that's a huge compliment,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every episode makes you a better grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The review keeps going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, keep up the good vibes,
Jeff, and don't forget, we like it when
[SPEAKER_02]: you ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be sure to take a fat dab and give my
mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Growgang, thank you for the dope
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that, and I'll try to do more
rambling for you, but I try to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: shows tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I catch myself on too many rants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really wanna catch me ranting,
I think Instagram Live is the place for
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you can find me on Instagram
Live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Irie, underscore, genetics,
I-R-I-E, underscore, G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S,
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram, Irie, underscore,
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch my live feeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of ranting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Growgang already follows me
there, so thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, thanks for the great review and the
great five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one more rating and review that
I'd like to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came from a person that called
themselves Lone Starred, and they gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: five stars, of course, and the headline
says, nothing better, and the review goes
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, thanks for all of your insight
into the culture, the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything A to Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've listened to several different
podcasts on the subject, and yours is,
[SPEAKER_02]: hands down, absolutely the cream of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for keeping Mondays constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being from a misinformed state,
it makes it a bit more difficult to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: hands-on.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, I live vicariously
through your podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly appreciate what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks from the Lone Star State.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Lone Starred, I think I actually read
your email on another episode also,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I remember saying your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thanks for the great review,
and thanks for all the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all the support, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep the show moving so we can keep
it quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have got an email that I would like to
read and share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes from our friend St. Skinny.
[SPEAKER_02]: St. Skinny and I try to interact a lot on
social media and through email.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been listening to the show for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to St. Skinny and also to Mama
Skinny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Broski, just wanted to pop in real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanted to pop in real quick to give a
little piece of advice for new growers
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wish I would have gotten when I
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, to grow other kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so St. Skinny says to grow
other kinds of plants, and he wishes that
[SPEAKER_02]: someone would have taught him this early
on in his grow career.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says even just growing some small
peppers or herbs in containers on your
[SPEAKER_02]: porch can give you an opportunity to try
some things you may not be willing to try
[SPEAKER_02]: on a plant you're counting on to produce
your medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: An example, maybe you've been wanting to
try manifold training or main lining or
[SPEAKER_02]: some other training technique,
but you're afraid to break or kill your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can try it with another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember that not every plant grows
the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in most cases, you want to stick with
something that grows similarly to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: An example, Echinacea grows nothing like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rosemary, Lemon Balm, and many other
plants have a similar structure and a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar response to topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention, these two particular
plants are also said to have pest
[SPEAKER_02]: repellent properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not grow or respond exactly like
cannabis would, but it's a great place to
[SPEAKER_02]: start and may end up rewarding your
efforts in the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great idea, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to stick to growing only
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of you are already growing other
stuff outdoors in your outdoor garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: but why not just set up a small container
garden on your porch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe use a small bit of space in the
backyard, or you can just do containers
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can set them up wherever you can fit a
few containers that animals like dogs and
[SPEAKER_02]: cats aren't going to get to and try to eat
your small plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some tomatoes, it looks like he said
some rosemary, some lemon balm,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any types of herbs or small plants would
be fun to grow, and you can experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you kill a tomato plant, it's not going
to be as detrimental as if you kill your
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to break your heart as
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're that type of person,
but it's not going to risk your cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: garden, and you're going to be able to
take more risks because you're not putting
[SPEAKER_02]: so much electricity and space and energy
and effort into these outdoor tester
[SPEAKER_02]: plants as you are that indoor cannabis
garden where you're feeding it the
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive nutrients and running the
expensive lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be afraid to experiment with some
small outdoor plants that are not
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, and it will also teach you about
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll just get a better appreciation for
growing in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll appreciate the art of growing,
the nature of growing, the process,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will develop a better relationship
with nature, the plants, yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis plants, the bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll all just feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be more growing, and growing
feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's connecting to the earth, to the
nature, to what we should be doing as
[SPEAKER_02]: humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you away from the computer for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you away from your social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you out of the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a place to be zen, and it's good
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for the environment,
and you're learning something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great idea, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email also has more.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, on another yet related note,
since the episode about synthetics versus
[SPEAKER_02]: organics wasn't too long ago, which at
this point it was kind of a while ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, I thought I'd mention a few
products that may make trying organics
[SPEAKER_02]: easier for some of the people wanting to
give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I have experience with is a
three-part pre-mixed organic dry nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: from Roots Organics called the Uprising
Line, which consists of Uprising Grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: Uprising Foundation, and Uprising Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're each different blends of kelp and
other meats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green sand, rock dust, guanos,
and all other sorts of funky goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down to Earth also makes mixes that are
similar and cheaper, but I haven't tried
[SPEAKER_02]: any of these myself just because when I
was buying amendments, the place I was
[SPEAKER_02]: shopping did not carry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the Uprising, this spring I
planted a variety of veggies and herbs
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Uprising Line, some castings,
and ProMix.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was my organics test to see if I
would try this mix with my MJ plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe how fast those darn
things grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a couple months, I felt comfortable
trying it out with one of my MJ plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was impressed with the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like he just gave us some
advice on some products we can buy to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: organically for the folks that want to go
organic because we did an organic episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about how it could be messy and
it could be more work, but it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy's found a three-part solution
that will make organic growing very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he mixed it with, what did he mix
it with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some ProMix and some worm castings using
the Uprising Line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am not paid to endorse the Uprising
Line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Saint Skinny is paid to
endorse anything either.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's simply sharing an experience with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably an easy line to get a hold
of also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Organics is a fairly popular brand
and I'm sure that most of your grow stores
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to have the Uprising products
and if not, I'm sure they're very easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's more to the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Skinny, no need to apologize for such
a good email.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of good advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave us recommendation on organic
nutrients that we can use that are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably available and affordable to most
growers and you also gave us a way that we
[SPEAKER_02]: could practice growing without ruining our
precious cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey dude, take another double dab for me
and then be sure to give Mama Saint a big
[SPEAKER_02]: fat hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers love brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you want to send me an email,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I will read your email on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now's a good time to remind you guys about
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
couple bucks or if you'd like to

[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're interested in helping out,

[SPEAKER_02]: The MacBook is starting to take a poop on
me, so it's almost time to replace that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon.com slash grow from your heart and
I would appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I've got one more thing I want
to talk about before I start wrapping up
[SPEAKER_02]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked me a question a few days
ago and I'm not going to get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: question, but I asked them why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you want to do that to your plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of gave me a short
explanation of why they thought they might
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to explain to them why what
they were doing wasn't a good idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is that's a perfectly normal
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should say, hey, I'm thinking about
doing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask somebody with more experience,
get some advice, see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my advice, every time you're thinking
about doing something to your cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, think to yourself, why am I doing
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is my intention?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to walk in there and do this weird
thing to my plant that I saw on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you trying to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you're going to do to that plant
today, you're not going to see it unless
[SPEAKER_02]: you take scissors to it and cut a piece
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see that immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's irreversible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you fucked up doing that, you're
fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to watch it fix itself and grow
out from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most other things, feeding, sprays,
they're going to take a little bit of time
[SPEAKER_02]: to show you the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you feed it something weird today,
you're not going to see that for maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: two, three, maybe five or seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you spray something, you might see it
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not see it for two, three,
five, seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about why am I doing what I'm
going to do to my plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you read something on the Internet and
it sounds like a good idea, or if some
[SPEAKER_02]: dude at the grow store told you some shit
and it sounds like a good idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: go think long and hard about why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go sit in your grow room silently by
yourself and stare at the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: think, why would I want to do this to my
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it makes sense, if it's logical,
if it's got a future, try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I became a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read, but I also did my own research and
thought long and hard before I did
[SPEAKER_02]: something to my precious crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what St. Skinny told us earlier to try
some stuff on some other plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of ties in with what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Practice on other plants if you've got the
opportunity, but still think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it before you do anything
because a lot of things you're going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: to your plants are irreversible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you put a lot of time, a lot of love,
a lot of energy and a lot of money into
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of you are doing it illegally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're risking your fucking life for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about it before you ruin stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, don't be afraid to get in there
and try something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to do something weird,
if you get this weird idea, if you and
[SPEAKER_02]: your buddy are like, bro, what if we do
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're already smoking a joint,
go eat a couple of burritos, chill out for
[SPEAKER_02]: a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think the idea through again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't smoked a joint yet,
go for a walk and smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then go sit down and think the idea
through again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a reason why you're going to do that
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen in three days from
what you did?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen in five days?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen in two weeks?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is this going to affect your grow in a
month?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to affect your harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to affect your yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to affect potency,
quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to do something stupid or
are you trying to do something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to improve the crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't think about it from your wallet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it logically.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, that's my rant for
the end of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for all the support.
