[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, shout out to my friends in the
Mystic Roots band for letting me use their
[SPEAKER_05]: music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big up, big up to the entire Mystic Roots
crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, make sure you catch Mystic Roots
on tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming through Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be in Boulder June 5th.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be in Fort Collins June 8th.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be at Cervantes in Denver June
9th.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I will be at the Black Sheep
June 11th with Ketchupaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come see me, take some dads with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn down the music a little bit,
because I feel like I'm fucking yelling
[SPEAKER_05]: over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that was louder than I realized.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having a party over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the party, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mood setter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mood setter.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the left of me, you guys, is the always
lovely, the traveling stoner, Miss
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in front of me is our buddy,
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming on the show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 1045 here on a lovely Friday evening
in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting them in when we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recording shows when we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I stumbled on the intro number,
I'm not sure if this is going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: episode 135 or 136.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recorded an episode with the Colorado
Podcast Boys, and it just got out of hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one may be used as a bonus episode
and not a normal podcast feed episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just put it out on a Thursday or
something, because there wasn't a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of growth talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want Australians that would love
the fuck out of you for any sort of extra
[SPEAKER_04]: content.
[SPEAKER_05]: That Australian guy was mentioned quite a
bit in that episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: An hour of shenanigans with those three.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pure shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure which one of us will put it
up first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Aussie friend said, we'll listen to it
the minute it drops on either one of our
[SPEAKER_05]: feeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made my decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be number 135.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Colorado Podcast mix episode will be
number 136.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put that out on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize in advance, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: That podcast is a mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some grow talks in there,
but Jesse got real high and Adam likes to
[SPEAKER_05]: interrupt a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hard to have a grow conversation,
but it was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of rambles and funness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us on 136.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: On this episode, I'm going to give a huge
shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass
[SPEAKER_05]: Gallery in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 517 South Tejon in beautiful Colorado
Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get yourself a new rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go say hello to the lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the podcast is available now on
Tokeradio.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can check out the show Wednesdays at
one o'clock on Tokeradio.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big old shout out to my buddy,
Citizen J.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for putting me on the network.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's all of the official
business that I need to spit out for right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys look high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're staring at me like, dude,
thank you for turning down that fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: music.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got show notes and so far the
topic's a secret, but I'm way too big to
[SPEAKER_04]: read upside down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about a secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got an email that I wanted to read
and I'm sure that you'll have a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: things to chime in with because- Always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay always has good shit to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: She brings up good points that I overlook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got an email that's part of the
topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does he want me to say his name or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say his name because he's
from an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says that he lives in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, hi, my name is something and I
live in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if you could do an episode
about how to control fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how to control fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not too hard of a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a good method, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a great method.
[SPEAKER_04]: My one and only bug solution that I ever
had the power to implement and really
[SPEAKER_04]: carry out to my own desire is sort of
nuclear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you go hard the one time you got bugs?
[SPEAKER_04]: The one time I got bugs, I got
spider-mited bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to town.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a month-long process that involves a
couple of gallons of bleach and killing
[SPEAKER_04]: everything you own, plant-wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a breeder, I don't have that option.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, a lot of people don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a breeder, I cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have to fight,
but no, fungus gnats was never one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: ones I really had to play with.
[SPEAKER_05]: This dude's asking about fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fungus gnats occur.
[SPEAKER_05]: They show up when your soil is kept too
moist or when your medium is kept too
[SPEAKER_05]: moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing in a giant commercial
warehouse, and in that warehouse,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've got a giant floor drain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oftentimes, I see little fucking fungus
gnats trying to fly up through that floor
[SPEAKER_05]: drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get rid of every bug in there,
but- They transfer pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the peat moss traveling fuckers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love peat moss.
[SPEAKER_05]: They come in soil all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You buy bags of soil and they're in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've helped people fight these
infestations.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can keep moisture levels down a
little bit in your soil, let your dirt dry
[SPEAKER_05]: up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll help get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use diatomaceous earth on top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the soil dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apply diatomaceous earth to the top of the
soil or the medium, if you got cocoa,
[SPEAKER_05]: and just leave it on there while it's dry,
and then water a little later.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to put that shit on there while
it's dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then those bugs won't want to climb in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I recommend, if you're trying to stay
all organic, there are little things at
[SPEAKER_05]: Lowe's or Home Depot called mosquito
dunks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just little donut looking things
in a red package.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put those in the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Submerge them in the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them sit there for a little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll get mushy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wear a rubber glove and rub them in your
hand and grind them up a little bit to
[SPEAKER_05]: where they turn into a powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let that sit in your reservoir and put a
little bit of that in each plant when you
[SPEAKER_05]: water.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a beneficial bacteria that I cannot
remember the name of right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it, but since I'm trying to tell
you, it's gone out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: That beneficial bacteria will kill off the
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cheap, effective, and organic in a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're doing a big grow, you may need a
product like Natural and you do the exact
[SPEAKER_05]: same process.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just feed that into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're going to want to triple check
that against your state's list if your
[SPEAKER_04]: state's gotten that far.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a home grow letter, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is a home grow guy in an
illegal state.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mosquito dunk solution is not a bad
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, go back and listen to the
episodes about ways of maintaining your
[SPEAKER_04]: garden to really prevent infestations from
occurring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, with fungus gnats,
a lot of times people bring them home from
[SPEAKER_04]: the grow store.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they come in the soil quite often.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had thrips come in soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that I've had spider mites
come in soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two people I've helped deal with this,
one of them got them when the guy that
[SPEAKER_04]: lived in the other side of the split level
started to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, two separate grows in one
domicile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude that started the second little
fun closet grow brought home fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_04]: in his soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy growing on the other side of the
grow immensely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the other person I know that got him,
that neighbor on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_04]: fence, or the other side of the alley
rather.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't figure out where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wandered in and found the plant and
went nuts was our best guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we heard them harvesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were bitching about all the little
white bugs flying out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were like, that's where they came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've got those bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't retaliate or say anything right
now because we don't want them to know we
[SPEAKER_04]: had plants back here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought their weed smelled good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were smelling our weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither of those were under my care,
but both of them were really hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: prevent type situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way to get rid of fungus gnats,
I think, is either the dunks or natural
[SPEAKER_05]: and dry out your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always use Azimax as a soil
drench.
[SPEAKER_05]: Use it really lightly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mix it in with water.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not know the ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says on the container as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pour a little bit of Azimax into some
water and just water the plants with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll help you out with fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't go that route unless it's
extreme, but it will work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless your plants are really healthy,
I don't know that I would do it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it'll work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like you're at least headed to
Lowe's or the local hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Lowe's and try.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put the mosquito dunks in there and water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if you have the time, depending on
how big your plants are, cover up the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can maybe take a paper plate and
cut a slit up it and then put the stem in
[SPEAKER_05]: that slit and then cover up the soil so
that the bugs don't have a way in or out,
[SPEAKER_05]: then the bugs that are in there will stand
there and die.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more bugs will be able to land in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't be breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll help you keep more shit out,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: The paper plate method will be totally
helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Diatinaceous earth if you want to go hard
on it, but I think the mosquito dunks or
[SPEAKER_05]: some natural will solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, part two of this email.
[SPEAKER_05]: This dude says, also could you speak about
the laws in Pueblo, Colorado for growing
[SPEAKER_05]: your own medicine?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe about four to six plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he says, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the show and enjoy all of the
educational.
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the educational information you
give.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let Mike talk a little bit
about growing laws in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the city and the county of Pueblo are
two different legal entities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dropping dimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a nickel actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how you dropping nickels?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the city and county both have slightly
different rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: For four to six plants, though,
in all of Colorado, any adult can legally
[SPEAKER_04]: grow six plants just because Amendment 64
passed and marijuana is legal here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as long as you keep no more than three
plants per adult in a household in flower
[SPEAKER_04]: and then say you were living inside city
limits, you kept those no more than three
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then your three veg plants and no more
than a hundred square foot grow space.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd pretty much be covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty small grow space.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to make it a lot smaller.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they wanted to live in your plant
count.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically me and one other citizen who
does not like his name being shared
[SPEAKER_04]: publicly, but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the help with that fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he listen?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just recently at his house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so in the city, you can you just
got to keep your grow restricted to the
[SPEAKER_04]: total square footage under a hundred
square feet, which is 10 by 10 or in the
[SPEAKER_04]: county.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there's there's a square foot limit,
I think overall, but it's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a plant count that's
total per household.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're talking about just growing
your own six legal plants under amendment
[SPEAKER_04]: 64, for say you and a domestic partner,
that would be 12 plants total you're under
[SPEAKER_04]: the under the limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, before you started your grow
in either of those locations, I would
[SPEAKER_04]: recommend heading to the appropriate
zoning department because there are two of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just asking politely for a copy of the
homegirl rules, which they're happy to
[SPEAKER_04]: give you or tell you how to find so that
you can go home and follow them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now there's a bunch of raids
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: People that moved here didn't read the
rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of them are quite quoted as
going, yeah, I come in and look like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: legal here, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, but there's rules and you
ain't going to jail just like you would in
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas or Florida for the same crimes with
the same penalties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we legal here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weird conundrum that the rules are
easy to follow, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for personal a personal harvest
sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play with your numbers and your
growth base and stuff and kind of maximize
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for a small grow four to six plants,
it's super easy to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some counties have made different grow
plant count limits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some counties don't have any plant count
limits that changes in every legal
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdiction in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if in Colorado or in Colorado,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you go to the medical marijuana
doctor, you can ask them to possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: recommend more plants so that you can have
more medicine and they'll write you an
[SPEAKER_05]: extended plant count if you qualify.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in some counties you're able to
grow however many your card says.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of counties have limited you a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just let you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have more and more counties and
cities, towns, everything, every little
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdiction in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're starting to pass rules limiting
the total size of a home cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, unless you own property where
you could grow acres and acres of corn
[SPEAKER_04]: within the next year or two, expect that
that area will have passed a limit of at
[SPEAKER_04]: least 20 plants or maybe 200 or 300 square
feet total grow space in a private
[SPEAKER_04]: residence in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a pretty fair bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope we answered your question very
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we got into that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your help on that, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got another message.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one came on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say the dude's name
because I don't know if people want their
[SPEAKER_05]: name said.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a private message.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, listening to your latest podcast,
digging it as usual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a quick heads up on your chloramine
question for a listener.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's for Seb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seb asked about the chloramine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was hard as shit to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chlorine is a gas that can be bubbled or
evaporated, but chloramine is not.
[SPEAKER_05]: No amount of bubbling will remove
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, its ability to stay in solution
is the reason water municipalities are
[SPEAKER_05]: switching to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: RO is the only thing that will work,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this guy knows what he's talking
about because he used the phrase stays in
[SPEAKER_05]: solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is definitely organic chemistry
major speak because we have a we share a
[SPEAKER_05]: mutual friend who is an O chem major.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says shit like that to me all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that makes me think he knows what he's
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seb, are you listening, my friend?
[SPEAKER_05]: Chloramine, the only way to get the
chloramine out of your water is a reverse
[SPEAKER_05]: osmosis machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to have to purchase one of
those.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell a cheap one, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell a small model.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go to the hydro shop for an RO
machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to either like we got a Wal-Mart here
in the states.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you guys have in
Australia, but like I like a home like
[SPEAKER_04]: wherever you do like I'm betting for Seb.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Internet's going to be his best bet on
this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'd go to the Internet and find
yourself an affordable reverse osmosis
[SPEAKER_05]: machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I baked or could he just boil off and
collect?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if distilling water would
work because this guy here says that it
[SPEAKER_05]: will stay in solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how that's going to work
when you distill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the chloramine is going to
move.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like seventh grade science,
but I'm pretty sure he just need the
[SPEAKER_04]: evaporation attempts of water and
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you've got me imagining my buddy Seb
in Australia, just stilling a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: water out in the bush, high as shit,
chasing an emu.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say watch your back.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's wild animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's trying to fucking kill him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's help this dude out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs a reverse osmosis machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro, Seb, go get an RO machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you got to do, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go get the right equipment that's
important for the grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want the water clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want the water pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get that machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that chloramine out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to, he said, hope that helps and
keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that part of the little community
you've built.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the people that send in the messages
are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally appreciate them because there'll
be some times when I'm not exactly sure
[SPEAKER_05]: what I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have a couple of ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got tons of notes written down for
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I ever run out of info, I'm just like,
oh, look, here's the notebook and there's
[SPEAKER_05]: tons of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when these guys send messages,
I'm like, oh, that's instant shit that I
[SPEAKER_05]: need to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys want to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just go and do some research if I
need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of the time I can spit it out off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that this guy just solved Seb's
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got to be a medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what I did?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that's the chloramine message
that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're talking about this a little bit
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just went and got my MMJ card,
my medical marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to rant for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is in Colorado, there's no,
I don't think anywhere in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States is there a medical marijuana
prescription other than the type that Irv
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosenfeld has.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a totally different thing than
what's available to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got a medical marijuana card
here in Colorado, it is a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a recommendation from a doctor that
you use cannabis to alleviate your
[SPEAKER_05]: problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a prescription because they can't
prescribe it to you because there's
[SPEAKER_05]: nowhere to go get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people, I was talking about getting my
medical marijuana recommendation renewed a
[SPEAKER_05]: few days ago, talking about when I got
stuck in the damn elevator and a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: people were like, well, how do I get my
card?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that since you work at a
dispensary and you work at a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys hear it at least once a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not as much, Mike, because this place is
recreational.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear about it constantly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's just do a little brief talk about
how you get your medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, you've got to be a Colorado
citizen and have some sort of proof of
[SPEAKER_05]: residency.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a Colorado ID or some sort of
bills that show that you're getting bills
[SPEAKER_05]: here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your phone bills, water bill,
electricity bill, some kind of shit like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need some bills if you don't have the
proper ID.
[SPEAKER_05]: You either need a proper ID or two things
that will prove that you're now a Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: resident, like a pay stub and a bill or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where you got to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Become a resident of Colorado,
get established here, get your shit
[SPEAKER_05]: together, have an address.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second thing, do you have,
this is what I used to say when I worked
[SPEAKER_05]: at a dispensary like 10 years ago and
people would be like, well, can I get a
[SPEAKER_05]: card?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say, do you have a qualified
condition that would justify the use of
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis to improve the quality of
your life?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I used to ask people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have, there's a list on the
Colorado Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_05]: Environment, they have a list of
qualifying conditions on there of things
[SPEAKER_05]: that qualify.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something hurts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Severe pain is a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that something hurts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's seven or nine listed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have one, but you've got
chronic pain of some sort, getting a car
[SPEAKER_04]: just involves two appointments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just have a reason why it hurts and
have something that hurts and stick with
[SPEAKER_05]: it and have a know when it happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can have some paperwork on it,
that's way even better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even really two appointments,
one appointment and one trip to the post
[SPEAKER_04]: office.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to a- All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mike's jumping ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike's getting extra credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this shit's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So have a condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure out what your condition is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure out what hurts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure out how you qualify.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you call.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking like the Colorado Springs
independent.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in Denver, look in the westward.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in Pueblo, we have the pulp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's somewhere that you can
look for a medical marijuana doctor in
[SPEAKER_05]: your region.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in Colorado or if you're in a
state that supports medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a way to find the doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Google medical marijuana doctor,
your state or medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_05]: your zip code.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll find them or ask one of your
friends that has a medical marijuana card
[SPEAKER_05]: where their doctor is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my MMJ doc.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say his name because he's
overbooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got to go see your doctor
anyway, they're a doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over 900 doctors in the state of sign,
so they're not exactly hard to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized this is why I looked up the
other day in the office at my doc's thing
[SPEAKER_05]: that he's a medical examiner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean he's the coroner?
[SPEAKER_05]: It means he can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember how it was in the
beginning though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were like three doctors and they all
had like a six month waiting time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that crazy guy that used to come
to our dispensary and give cards?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, back in the day you could go into
the dispensary and there would be a doctor
[SPEAKER_05]: in there that would write your
recommendation and you could shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time that doctor got done filling
out your name, you were already picking on
[SPEAKER_05]: him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. J was insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you go to the doctor, figure out
your condition, send an appointment,
[SPEAKER_05]: find one of these doctors, send an
appointment, have records if you really
[SPEAKER_05]: want to, know what hurts and then know
what to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go in there when they're like,
so why do you need weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't like not having weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually sound professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go in there and be legit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, our medical marijuana program
here in Colorado is under enough scrutiny
[SPEAKER_04]: and pressure and under fire in the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't manage to get through the
interview with the doctor without looking
[SPEAKER_04]: like a jackass and hurt the movement,
just stay home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't deserve a card if you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not hard at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you're coming to be an
activist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Earlier Mike said don't show up with your
weed cape.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your knee hurts, if you can elaborate
on that for more than a minute or two
[SPEAKER_04]: using medical terminology because you've
seen other doctors because your knee hurts
[SPEAKER_04]: and they recommended other shit for your
knee hurting, getting a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: card for your chronic knee pain will not
be a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want an extended plant count,
you're going to need to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to have some sort of
crunching noises.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to show some kind of
scars.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got some paperwork, that would
really help.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ask your doctor, would you be
willing to write an extended plant count
[SPEAKER_05]: for me?
[SPEAKER_05]: He may ask you how many you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be prepared to pay for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The normal cost of a doctor should be
around $100.
[SPEAKER_05]: The basic cost to get your basic card
should be around $100.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to get an added fee of
probably another $100 to get an elevated
[SPEAKER_05]: plant count, depending on how high it is,
there are some doctors that will go fairly
[SPEAKER_05]: high and they will charge you up to $400
or $500.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a fucking lawyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a weed guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my experience in the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get one of those 99 plant counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a red flag for a person that is
fucking around and trying to beat the
[SPEAKER_05]: system and do something that they
shouldn't be doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple of 500 count cards in
the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that shit either.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like eight of them and they're all
on a list and the MED has been to all of
[SPEAKER_04]: the addresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing with the 250 counts and the
300 counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of that's going to be gone in a year,
maybe two at the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because of one or two people abusing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the people with the 500 count cards
is making oil for kids and he gives it all
[SPEAKER_04]: away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not all gaming the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them, in fact, are following the
rules, but there's been one or two really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really obnoxious people that have really
pushed the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of that system is going to get
regulated away the next two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The caregiver is going to be a thing in
the past by 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you said caregiver just now
because that's part of the next step.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask the doc for an elevated plant count if
you desire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pay for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, you're going to start
signing a bunch of papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be asked to assign a
provider.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you plan on growing your own medicine,
you do not want to assign a provider.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are going to be a caregiver,
you cannot have a provider, nor can you
[SPEAKER_05]: have a dispensary as your provider if
you're going to be a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you sign your rights to the plants to a
caregiver, you have now waived your rights
[SPEAKER_05]: as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot of words.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to get out properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Decide who you want to grow your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a trusted friend, I have a couple
of people like Mike and our good buddy
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am responsible for growing their
cannabis and keeping these guys medicated
[SPEAKER_05]: and feeling all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know somebody that grows well and
you trust them, make an arrangement with
[SPEAKER_05]: them, make a relationship with them,
and have an agreement to where the
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine comes, and they're ready for it,
and they've got it, and you've got it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and shit works.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get papers notarized.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll need a copy of their ID if you're
going to make them your caregiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: The doctor will have everything there you
need other than your buddy's ID.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a notary there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll take care of all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So assign a caregiver, and then they're
going to give you a bunch of papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll need a money order.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the places will give you the
money order.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll have it there for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, just go to wherever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the Western Union, Lofenjug,
7-Eleven, wherever sells the damn money,
[SPEAKER_05]: or the post office.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get yourself a money order.
[SPEAKER_05]: King Supers.
[SPEAKER_05]: King Stupids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you need to mail that certified mail
to where you get the thing back when they
[SPEAKER_05]: get it so that you get the return receipt
so that you know that they have received
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you wait in the mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how long it's taken for cards
to come back right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either one of you guys know?
[SPEAKER_05]: The time varies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope not too long, because mine is out
of fucking commission right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It expired yesterday, so I can't shop at
the dispensary until it comes back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually no more than 30 days the last
year or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: The table went silent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't shop for 30 days, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: At one point, it was like an eight-month
wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that wonderfulness?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was back when it was 100 to the
doctor and 100 to the state, which meant
[SPEAKER_04]: the state gave you a free year every time
you did your card because it took us some
[SPEAKER_04]: damn long to process it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was back when you could still use
your 10 paperwork for that whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure I accepted fake paperwork
when I worked at that old dispensary
[SPEAKER_05]: because the paperwork changed so
frequently that they would show up with
[SPEAKER_05]: new stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be like, it looks really right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's notarized.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, go ahead and shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so much easier to verify now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, now you get a purple card with a
barcode on it and your name on it and the
[SPEAKER_05]: provider's name on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've changed it again, I heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard we're getting a new pool card.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting, because Lindsay would see
firsthand.
[SPEAKER_05]: She checks IDs and cards all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's still the purple cards,
but actually now for the certified mail
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, there's a whole list of ones that
are voided and aren't real and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When someone comes in, there's just a
quick list you have to check.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, of cards that have expired and
been voided.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people who have stolen cards and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how much detail I can go
into.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend who is employed by a
dispensary and they caught somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: stealing, blatantly shoplifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: They saw the person do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They saw it on camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: They went and checked the camera,
but while the person was still in the room
[SPEAKER_05]: so that they had proof, they didn't make a
false accusation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They walked outside and they said,
Mr. Customer, we've got you on camera
[SPEAKER_05]: stealing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we have our product back?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, I didn't steal shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, okay, have a good day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just let the customer leave and they
called the cops and the MED.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, hey, revoke his card and
send police there to get our product back.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cops went and got the product back and
confiscated his MMJ card and the MED,
[SPEAKER_05]: or no, not the MED because it's not
immediate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment discontinued his
[SPEAKER_05]: card.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took his card from him and he cannot
renew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't steal from a damn dispensary if you
are privileged enough to go in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, there's a reason dispensary
robberies are so infrequent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because everybody in Colorado has
seen the number of cameras that are
[SPEAKER_04]: required and has seen the one or two
reports of the dude who does rob one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get arrested like an hour later.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get seen from 17 different angles just
walking in the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can zoom in on the camera and read the
VIN number and you'll be jailed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a, yeah, you really can.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can read the VIN number on the inside
of your car on the dash, tucked in that
[SPEAKER_05]: little gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can read that number with the cameras.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear the security guard go, nope,
that's a cigarette and he's zooming in
[SPEAKER_04]: across the other side of the parking lot
to somebody who just fired something up in
[SPEAKER_04]: the driver's seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a contractor working on air
conditioners the other day in the
[SPEAKER_05]: building.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's summertime, summer maintenance on the
ACs and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He walked out to the truck to get a tool
and put a cigarette in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go, bro, I can't have you smoking on the
property.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, no one's going to see me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go, if you look around, there's cameras
on the outside of the building every eight
[SPEAKER_05]: feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: He looked up and he was like, yo,
man, I'm pretty sure he might have had a
[SPEAKER_05]: cigarette while he was up working on the
air conditioner because I could smell that
[SPEAKER_05]: shit when I was inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: There aren't any cameras up there,
but he was up there smoking on the roof.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty damn sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people trying to put out blunts,
pulling in all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Remind me to tell you a story off there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to tell the new employees,
remind every employee the first couple
[SPEAKER_04]: times that they're working.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remember that you're always on
camera.
Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to pick your ass, it's recorded
in HD for prosperity for all time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people are watching these cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like nobody's watching these
cameras and, oh, it doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just there for show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just there if something bad
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are always watching those cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always reviewing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have weird things happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our grow is not in the best part of town
and it's at the end of a street where you
[SPEAKER_05]: could do whatever you want because
honestly, it's at the end of the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing else down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody travels that direction unless
they're coming to our grow to do some
[SPEAKER_05]: stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oftentimes, I'll find parts of the gate.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll have unscrewed all of the bolts on
the gate, but they use the types of bolts
[SPEAKER_05]: where the nuts won't come off the end of
the bolt.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took the end of the bolt and
flattened it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can only unscrew it so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get that bracket really well
undone, but you can't get it off still.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to get our gate open
because our gate's barbed wire across
[SPEAKER_05]: three layers of barbed wire across the
top.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't get in through that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to just get it open.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit like that happens every other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They threw carpets over the barbed wire
and climbed the fence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had locked trash cans and they
climbed up on high shit and jumped like
[SPEAKER_05]: body slammed through the trash can lids to
get to our trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't even anything good in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually an exploded bag of
compound putty that I'd thrown away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever jumped in there that night was
covered in compound putty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking funny because there's a footprint
going to the fucking sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they had to climb back over that gate
with their carpets and covered in compound
[SPEAKER_05]: putties and get in their car and drive
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got footage of all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time we see it, we've got a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The video lights up red if there's no
action on the camera and then it lights up
[SPEAKER_05]: green dots every time there's movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can just go scroll right to the green
and be like, oh look, there's that dipshit
[SPEAKER_05]: on camera one.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a camera 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a camera eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just see them from all angles
doing stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: People do see all of that footage that
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if we're randomly looking for ... One
time we lost something in the grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, where the fuck did it go?
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't find where something went.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just totally found where it started and
then just watched it on the camera,
[SPEAKER_05]: watched where it traveled through a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're like, oh, it's up on this top
shelf where nobody can even see it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just right up here and just went and
grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what other shit we may have seen
if we would have paid attention to that
[SPEAKER_05]: video because we were on an entire day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably people scratching their balls,
picking their noses, picking their asses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people, somebody will walk out to
their car and notice it's been dinged.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five minutes later, they're on the phone
with PD like, yeah, my car was hit in my
[SPEAKER_04]: work parking lot today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know who did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got their lights on video.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just dispensaries, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's on camera now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're out there smoking, you're out
there doing whatever you're doing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're on camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be aware of your surroundings.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people everywhere and they don't
all like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them do not like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't like falafel.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't talk about that on the air,
but I parked somewhere and somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: accused me of consuming cannabis while I
was eating a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not illegal to have dry rocks and
have lunch at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I'm eating a falafel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want some?
[SPEAKER_05]: You mad, boo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Free the falafel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, free the falafel.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys, we've been going for like
30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: People only like to listen to 36 minute
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, listen longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: 36 minutes is the prime number for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag, I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have anything you'd like to
bring to the table for this fine podcast?
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you're registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think we covered that on the last
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cover it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the listener's name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should push pause, press pause and go
search through my Facebook messages.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a listener who mentioned
Gary Johnson in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And suddenly dude is getting popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there are a lot of people that are
dissatisfied with the current candidates
[SPEAKER_04]: and Gary Johnson is getting a little bit
of traction.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was on one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he was on the Nerdist podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was on one of the good ones that I
listened to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might have been on Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wouldn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should press pause and do some research
right now, but I should find the kind
[SPEAKER_05]: listener who introduced us to Gary
Johnson.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Joe Rogan, but Gary Johnson
was on a podcast recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've known Gary for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He seemed to me he didn't give politician
answers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be like, hey, what's two plus two?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wouldn't go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I really think like four point three
would look good.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would be like four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two and two is four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he was straight up about shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I feel like politicians do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, what's your favorite flavor
of ice cream?
[SPEAKER_05]: And a politician's like, well,
I really feel like cake is the way to go
[SPEAKER_05]: in 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, all right, motherfucker,
what's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you see pie has always been my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you get from most politicians
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big Gary Johnson fan and he's very
much pro medical marijuana, pro marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization, pro ending the drug war.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think he's a viable candidate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of his money plans are a little
goofy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't want to get into Gary
Johnson's economic plans.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the dude came out of nowhere and one
of our listeners kind of predicted that
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to our listener.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for paying attention for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for making me aware of the guy
because I the second time I heard about
[SPEAKER_05]: him was on I'm pretty sure it was the Joe
Rogan Experience podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Joe Rogan for doing that
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dude's on like 800 and something
fucking episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Him and Chris Hardwick are leading that
shit forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they started it forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Corolla might get some credit for
five years, but I don't know who really
[SPEAKER_05]: started it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know Corolla is up there,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of the podcasting heroes,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to seeing what Gary
does with the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see what the rest of everything
does.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what the fuck is happening in Canada?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, oh, we're going to legalize
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then why are the fucking Royal
Canadian Mounted Police raiding
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries in Canada now that cannabis
is legal?
[SPEAKER_04]: People kind of jumped a gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really don't agree with what the
authorities did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, if you didn't see it
coming, you're blind deaf and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: watching something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been saying for weeks that you
can't do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not legal yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rules haven't been passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't figured out zoning or hours
of operation or taxes and that shit yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, you're just slowing down the
movement by jumping the gun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've decided on the legal age
of 24 is what consumption age is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's I listen to a guy with the
Canadian podcast, and I think he was
[SPEAKER_05]: saying that 24 is what they were
discussing last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little old in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should be closer to 18, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But 21 is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I have to go with 21.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I've got a daughter who's
creeping up on 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: If she came up to me right now and she's
like, oh, dad, can I get a dad?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be like, well, you got to smoke some
flour first.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, like I'd probably if she
wanted to sit down with us and smoke,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would not tell her no, because I'd
rather her sit down and puff with us than
[SPEAKER_05]: run off with her little girlfriends and
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here in Colorado, if you're under
like between 18 and 21 and have a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: condition, you can get a card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: My daughter has no interest in smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just putting that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: She thinks it smells stupid is what she
said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just did this with my niece.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to do it again with my nephew.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got a kid who's like almost one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to be doing it again in a few
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like somewhere between 18 and 21 works
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like the idea of a much safer,
gentler and toxic and being legal before
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like some training wheels before
you just push the little fucker down the
[SPEAKER_04]: hill on his bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you referring to your own kid as that
little fucker?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so tired right now because he likes to
cry when I sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, birth control, people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should practice with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: But wow, you really don't want one of
these when you're young.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get old first.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love these podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jeff said all the people that tune
out after half an hour tuned out,
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this awesome 36 minutes for you guys
who stick around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all the listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay's been quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to break her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay has been kind of quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been really stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, I mean, she showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: She showed up with like five grams of
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was like, who wants the dad?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay, is there anything you'd like to
talk about on the show tonight?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to take a minute?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you'd like to bring to
the table?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're blushing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should, you and I should give a shout
out to Hunt and Amy and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Green and Healthy Wellness crew because I
thought Amy put the party together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turns out Joe put the party together and
then Hunt's the boss.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to everybody that put the
party together for the Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: Wellness crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first time I ever took dads at
Breezy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good time dabbing with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The boss took us out to dinner afterward.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to go to the old rabbit hole and
get some good ass food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once your food was delivered, you went
fucking silent.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was like, food shut up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw some of the social media stuff from
this event.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't blame her for being baked and
tearing into food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got, we got plenty baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: The boss showed up and passed out edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are your edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he looked at me and he's like,
here's lots of edibles for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of fucked me up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the rabbit hole was a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The boys ate, well not just the boys,
the boys and a young lady because Amy was
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They ate a thing called the butcher's
block, which is pretty much a big slab of
[SPEAKER_05]: wood with one of every animal you could
imagine cooked beautifully.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a vegetarian and I was looking at it
like, that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like whoever did this is a fucking artist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they did a really good job on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not hateful to people who consume meat
because I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat your stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it, put it in your mouth, whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to eat any of that crap,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that stuff was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a cherry, what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cherry braised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, back ribs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like pork ribs or something like
that or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked, it was picturesque.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that's like some Food Network
shit right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks Hunt for taking us out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks Joe and Amy for putting the party
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the name of the place where we
smoked abs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Studio A64.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to that place for letting us go
in there and take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a cool atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an old bar that they just
cleaned out and where there used to be
[SPEAKER_05]: beer bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there are bongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some fun reporting on it
because isn't there another consumption
[SPEAKER_04]: club?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's 64, then there's like a
different kind of store and then there's
[SPEAKER_04]: another smoke shop or smoke club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't there, there's store 64,
which is like a dispensary, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: across the street from Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's studio A66, yeah,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, where we went and dabbed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be thinking of a shop or a smoke
club with a very similar name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest with you, I only really go to
Kanigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: When your outfit has either the acronym
THC or the amendment A64 working with the
[SPEAKER_04]: title, I kind of shake my head and I look
for the next one on the block.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to be too big of a dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just easier to avoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a mediocre corporate brain fart one
day in business school and then opened a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary places that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I didn't just bitch slap like 30
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap up
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay Owen, thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for letting me sit here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to my good friend,

[SPEAKER_05]: Bobo, you're in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait for you to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in Portugal now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went.
[SPEAKER_05]: This dude's been traveling, getting
dirtier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Them dreadlocks are getting more
Wook-like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro, hope you're having a good time in
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to this in Portugal.

[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.

[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the beach, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go run around on the beach and have
a good time.

I need attendance from my nurse around the
clock.
