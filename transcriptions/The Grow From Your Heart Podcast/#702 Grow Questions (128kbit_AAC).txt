new year that will be the next holiday
[SPEAKER_00]: then we settle in with a fresh start let's
get into an email because i do want to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer at least one maybe two emails here
in this short one camera episode yes we're
[SPEAKER_00]: only recording with one camera today still
trying to figure out a tech issue we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get it figured out you guys aren't
concerned with that i do apologize it's
[SPEAKER_00]: only one camera tried to deliver a two
camera show let's get to this message it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from our friend who calls themselves
they
[SPEAKER_00]: did not even sign it there's no name
should sprout unfortunately our friend got
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned got tied up in a video game got
distracted i don't know what happened i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: making shit up our buddy got distracted
and those seedlings went dry the question
[SPEAKER_00]: is should i start over or will these
plants be stunted in the future and or
[SPEAKER_00]: offer less yield less ideal plants to
breed and clone in the long run or will
[SPEAKER_00]: they somehow recover and be worth keeping
thank you ire this is a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: question i don't have any scientific input
or evidence based on what i'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: support what i'm going to say this is just
what i think and what i've experienced and
[SPEAKER_00]: how i think that the will to survive
excuse me if you heard me get all choked
[SPEAKER_00]: up talking about the will to survive and
life must go on it got me all choked up
[SPEAKER_00]: there so you say that the taproots
generally still seem healthy your concern
[SPEAKER_00]: here is should i start over will these
plants be stunted will these plants not
[SPEAKER_00]: offer what they could have i don't think
you if they keep growing if they survive i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think you cause them any problems i
think they will recover i think they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: bounce back they will give you their full
potential possibly they may be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit stronger i think anything that goes
through a little bit of a struggle a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of adversity and survives it
comes out stronger better i think the
[SPEAKER_00]: phrase is what doesn't kill me only makes
me stronger i think you may have done that
[SPEAKER_00]: to these plants if they didn't die during
your little drought period if they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: go too dry they're fine they're going to
be great plants i would not start over i
[SPEAKER_00]: would keep growing these i would proceed
as usual business as usual on with the
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly scheduled program i think you're
going to get good viable usable plants
[SPEAKER_00]: they will live up to their potential their
full outcome you can clone breed keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant i think you're going to do
great so nothing to worry about there as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you keep them going as long as
they're still healthy as long as they look
[SPEAKER_00]: happy if they do give you any problems
once you get them past that tiny delicate
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling stage if you do have any problems
don't blame it on yourself for this issue
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have to get them past this they've
got to recover they've got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cotyledons and turn into plants if you
have any issues after the cotyledons form
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're actually plants uh that is not
from this so don't use this as like a uh a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason later um this isn't the uh the
sprained ankle in training camp is not why
[SPEAKER_00]: you lost the fight six weeks later don't
blame this this isn't why so if you do run
[SPEAKER_00]: into trouble it wasn't from this i think
you will have success i've rambled on more
[SPEAKER_00]: than enough about this episode or about
this question anonymous thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great question i hope i helped you out i
hope you keep those seedlings going i hope
[SPEAKER_00]: they look good hope they're healthy uh if
they're anything from my line i hope to
[SPEAKER_00]: see pictures of the kids as they grow up i
do enjoy uh people usually send me a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower picks i get big chunky bud shots
trichome shots love all that shit also i
[SPEAKER_00]: do appreciate uh veg picks clone flower
seed i love the whole stage let me see
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff especially if there's something
weird or interesting happening in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow i like baby pictures i like adult
pictures that sounds weird when you say it
[SPEAKER_00]: like that uh baby pictures of my kids i
like that my seedlings i want to see them
[SPEAKER_00]: in all stages you guys let's get my high
ass back on track because obviously i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling up a fucking storm over here
let's focus this message comes from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend is i am i supposed to say your name
um this one comes from our friend dave in
[SPEAKER_00]: ontario i'm going to cut out part of the
details but big up to our buddy dave in
[SPEAKER_00]: ontario thank you for the great question
it goes a little bit like this it says
[SPEAKER_00]: rasta jeff it's your friend dave from
ontario it says you and i both have brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injuries which may be why i'm so rambly
today it says i love we both love growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and we love comedians bro we
could be friends did we just become best
[SPEAKER_00]: friends we grow weed we got brain injuries
and we like comedians we could get along
[SPEAKER_00]: we could work well on a car trip together
it says you are a cannabis hero um i'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to argue if you think i'm your hero
but i am no way consider myself think of
[SPEAKER_00]: myself as a hero that felt weird to read
but i can't be little or discreet your
[SPEAKER_00]: label so i am a fucking hero thank you bro
i appreciate that it says as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: general hero to me i will definitely take
credit if you call me a hero i've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be your hero be disrespectful not to take
it it says i was that guy talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: doug stanhope strain one time uh that's
funny in my instagram lives we chat about
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names and random chaos i like to
name strains after uh people that inspire
[SPEAKER_00]: me things that make my life better uh
things that just are great and i named
[SPEAKER_00]: strains after tom sagura and burke
chrisher burke chrysler brant chrysler how
[SPEAKER_00]: do you say it burke chrysher that's the
guy's name i made strains after those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: uh the socca soufflé and the machine are
named after those two uh tom sagura and
[SPEAKER_00]: burke chrysher and we were joking that
there should be a doug stanhope name and i
[SPEAKER_00]: can't come up with a strain name for doug
stanhope but that'd be funny because doug
[SPEAKER_00]: stanhope is one of my uh favorite
comedians he is great i got to see him at
[SPEAKER_00]: the oriental theater here just a couple of
months ago honestly frustrating myself i
[SPEAKER_00]: caught myself too high and zoning out
during the show i took a vape pen into
[SPEAKER_00]: that show because it was a theater show
and i was hitting the pen the opening act
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't my favorite no disrespect to uh i
won't even say his name the opener was
[SPEAKER_00]: boring and i was just hitting my pen to
pass time and by the time doug came out i
[SPEAKER_00]: was way too high for a comedy show uh so i
missed i feel like i missed part of it i
[SPEAKER_00]: realized this i was like you're zoning out
you're looking around at the crowd and
[SPEAKER_00]: like paying attention to the wrong shit i
had to lock myself in and pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: stanhope but he was great i did enjoy it
once i kind of uh snapped out of my coma
[SPEAKER_00]: but uh doug stanhope's fucking awesome if
you guys haven't heard digging up mother
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to that bit it's a comedy bit um
it's dark it's dark so i hope you're into
[SPEAKER_00]: dark comedy anyway doug stanhope strain
name would be great i digress this message
[SPEAKER_00]: says anyway i have a couple of your
strains in my veg tent from seed i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: sun kiss and rafael they're about four to
five weeks old that's good info it says i
[SPEAKER_00]: want to determine the sex of my sun kiss
so i turned my veg tent to 1212 to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to show sex so in five to ten days i
expect to see signs of it being male or
[SPEAKER_00]: female that will work that's going to do
what you're thinking it's going to do says
[SPEAKER_00]: now my question is how long do i have to
run or how long do i have to run 18.6
[SPEAKER_00]: again before determining the sex of the
plant after determining the sex of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant sorry i misread part of that thought
it sounded kind of weird it was my fault
[SPEAKER_00]: not yours so then he does follow that up
with an example it says my example uh day
[SPEAKER_00]: one i switched from 18.6 to 1212 day 55 i
determined sun kiss is a female so i
[SPEAKER_00]: switched from 1212 back to 18.6 now what
day would sun kiss be safe to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1212 and go through its normal flowering
cycle that is a very good question um i
[SPEAKER_00]: like the idea i like the strategy i like
the approach however i would have done
[SPEAKER_00]: this a little bit differently i would have
put these plants into flower when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were a few inches tall i would not have
done this at what are we 45 days in now
[SPEAKER_00]: the hormones in those plants have spread
and developed so much more and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into flower those hormones are
going to take a little bit longer to
[SPEAKER_00]: switch over to flower to show you that the
plant is in flower depending on it may it
[SPEAKER_00]: may be uh it may have reached a sexual
point in its growth that it could have
[SPEAKER_00]: some pre-flower into it it may be ready
which also could be a problem uh because
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's not going to want to go back to
veg as quickly so i would have done it
[SPEAKER_00]: much earlier your plants are 45 days in
when you put them into flower it is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take you that 10 to 12 day period to
find out if you've got a male or female
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can put it back into veg but it's
going to take a little bit longer because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a plant with much more hormones
much more stuff to work with that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to return all the way back to veg i
would give it two three at least three
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe four weeks to veg before i went back
into flower at this point you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big ass plant what i would have
done and i'm not saying you can't do your
[SPEAKER_00]: method you can do this but it's going to
be slightly stressful on the plant and on
[SPEAKER_00]: you what i would have done what would have
been better next time what you can do is
[SPEAKER_00]: either flip these plants when they are
much much smaller like i said when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch tall i determine the sex before
they find their forever home so i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: waste space i don't waste soil i don't
waste even waste the time up potting them
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't waste the electricity they go from
seed into a beer cup i get some cotyledons
[SPEAKER_00]: i let them grow i put them into flower
they'll show me in when they're that
[SPEAKER_00]: little they'll show you pretty quickly if
they're male or female and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: toss them really quickly then you don't
even transplant the boys they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: make it to that stage so i would have done
it much earlier uh then you're gonna vet
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna take your small plants veg
them for a week then flower them for seven
[SPEAKER_00]: to ten days put them back into veg and now
in like 10 to 12 days those plants will go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into veg because they're so little
but we're gonna grow them out for weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're just starting them so
they've got all that veg time to recover
[SPEAKER_00]: uh they're gonna continue to grow while
the hormones go back into a vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and it won't take long depending on
how deep into flower you got them 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_00]: days isn't too far they should revert
fairly quickly if they're little plants
[SPEAKER_00]: without a lot of a lot of changes in
hormones so that should work better for
[SPEAKER_00]: you what i can recommend that you can do
with these plants since you're already at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point i do have a great
recommendation for you to minimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on yourself and these plants what i
would do at this time is i would take a
[SPEAKER_00]: few clones from the plant that you're
trying to sex and sex the clone you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: these big fancy plants they've been going
for 45 days you should have pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: plants by now they should be a couple feet
tall they should be nice and branchy you
[SPEAKER_00]: should have at least two or three maybe
four or five viable clones available off
[SPEAKER_00]: of each plant i would get a clone dome and
a tray and some clone plugs or an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner if you really want to make an
investment if you've already got it set it
[SPEAKER_00]: up get it running i would invest in a
cloning setup then i would take a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: from each of these sun kiss plants i don't
know how many you have in there um a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of them so it sounds like just one
i would take two or three clones from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun kiss plant one of them if you can turn
it into a mother plant that way you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a proven female for next time you already
know it's a girl you don't have to sex it
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how we uh do a see i would have
done a proper phenol hunt first is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what i'm getting at we're gonna get you a
phenol hunt out of this uh to find out if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a plant that's even worth
growing after 45 days what i would do let
[SPEAKER_00]: me get my ass back on track here i would
take a clone i would get the clone and a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone dome uh you've probably got four or
five clones off there take four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: clones maybe designate one as a mom keep
that around i would put this clone dome
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower right away get four or five
clones put them into flower you can cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones dip them stick them put them
under 12 12 lighting while they are
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting they will also flip to flower they
will then show you in seven 10 12 maybe 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days if they are boys or girls those
clones will be boys or girls just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant they came from you've only got one
plant so if it shows you boy that plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: a boy if it shows a girl that plant is a
girl so i would cut clones oftentimes i
[SPEAKER_00]: like to lollipop my plants right before
they go into flower um that means taking
[SPEAKER_00]: off the bottom stuff if you can get a
couple of good clones off the bottom pull
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff off there you can clean the
plant up and create clones at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time if your plant is getting tall and
it's getting unruly you can always take
[SPEAKER_00]: that center top right out of the middle
and use that for a clone i love cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: that center top i top my plants anyway so
that topping that just becomes a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy hearty clone i label that one
clone a plant a put that clone in the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone dome put it under 12 12 lighting
right now in my area i'm in north america
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm in colorado we're experiencing less
than 12 hours of light per day i think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're headed back up in daylight hours at
this time we might be going more but still
[SPEAKER_00]: currently uh we do experience fucking
about six hours of daylight it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: i think we might get seven and a half
eight hours of daylight right now if you
[SPEAKER_00]: put a clone dome in a window sill it just
provided it daylight it has to stay warm
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get it cold in colorado it might
fucking freeze to death right now oddly
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not cold enough but it will get cold
for the plant um put that clone under 12
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 lighting if it gets 12 hours of
darkness every day it will go into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and then in 10 12 maybe 14 days you will
know if that plant is a male or female and
[SPEAKER_00]: you won't have to stress out your big
plant by putting it into flower putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: back into veg at this point i would almost
just put that depending on how much space
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got you've got the uh what's your
size i think you told me the size of your
[SPEAKER_00]: tent no it doesn't say the size i would
just put that bitch into flower and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it at this point and then find out if it's
a male or female 45 days uh what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for that's about how long my
plants veg they don't get that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: veg time that bitch would be running turn
it and burn it at this point um so you do
[SPEAKER_00]: have an option uh you do have a couple of
options i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the big plant into flower and then
bringing it back i would just veg for two
[SPEAKER_00]: more weeks and then put it into flower and
send it don't even bring it back just let
[SPEAKER_00]: it go if it's a boy it's a boy you cut it
down if it's a girl finish it let it go
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way or your other option is to
take a clone and put that clone under 12
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 lighting right away and it will show
you sex within just a few days uh in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future i would recommend to either get a
clone from it much earlier as soon as the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is big enough to clone cut a clone
sex the clone or sex that plant when it is
[SPEAKER_00]: real tiny so we don't get 45 days in um
and not know if that plant is a boy or a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl i i couldn't handle 45 days wondering
is that a dude or is that a chick that
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been hanging out with like i'd really
want to know by now so i find out much
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier that way it would have never even
it's probably in a three maybe a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot do you tell me in this message
you don't mention that but it's in a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: big enough to sustain it for 45 days it's
probably a three gallon at least which
[SPEAKER_00]: means you got three gallons of dirt which
means it's taking up at least a one by one
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a two by two square foot space in
your grow space um it is definitely taking
[SPEAKER_00]: what's most valuable to me in that
equation is the plant number i'm only
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed so many plants so if that's a dude
that i don't need that's a wasted fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: number i could have done something way
better with a plant that i do need what
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes i need a boy sometimes i need a
female but if i don't need a boy and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a boy uh get rid of it so i can replace it
i can have 12 and every one of those 12
[SPEAKER_00]: counts when you're a seed breeder trying
to create new shit trying to discover
[SPEAKER_00]: things phenol hunt keep moms it gets
hectic it's a fun juggle so uh let me
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly recap because that is my style
what i would have done is i would have
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered it much sooner and then put it
back into veg when it was six inches tall
[SPEAKER_00]: it would have gone into flower maybe even
three or five inches tall but it gone into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower we would have discovered if it was
a boy or a girl then put it right back
[SPEAKER_00]: that way i don't have to take a clone i
don't have another plant count that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to dodge another plant in the count
just flower that one then it's still there
[SPEAKER_00]: the other that clone just doubled my plant
count if i clone everything to sex test it
[SPEAKER_00]: i just doubled my fucking count so i would
do that or uh there's another option i
[SPEAKER_00]: almost looked over sex testing you can do
the mail-in sex testing order a sex test
[SPEAKER_00]: card rub your weed plant on the card mail
it in the lab will tell you if it's a boy
[SPEAKER_00]: or a girl let me get back on track where i
was uh what i would do what i would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend is the early sexing from a small
plant or grow it get a clone sex test the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone when you do the clones also you can
revert the clones they'll go back quicker
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can keep a mom that way or you can
put this bad bitch into flower and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does at this point i know it
sounds uh it may sound crazy but dude
[SPEAKER_00]: you're 45 days in how long do you really
plan on vegging this plant how big do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want it you're already 45 days in i would
just turn it and burn it send it see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you got if it's a boy you've wasted 45
days if it's a girl you're gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent harvest um if you want to keep
vegging it it's gonna get big uh but and
[SPEAKER_00]: and i think quicker veg cycles and more
cycles per year is more productive in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion i don't know your space i don't
know your situation but my advice fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: send it get her done get that bitch out of
