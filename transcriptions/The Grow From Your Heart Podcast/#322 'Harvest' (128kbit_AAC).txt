[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the grow
from your heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by my friends at the hella dame seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the hella dank seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dank seed dot store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bomb or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up internet world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 322 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
talking about what I've been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of rocket fuel and
brosha from our friends at apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking open the jar now and you
know, I've never, I don't think I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled rocket fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've stood next to rocket
fuel before, but I imagine this could be
[SPEAKER_00]: close to what rocket fuel would smell
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fuely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost makes my eyes burn just a little
bit in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smoke this stuff, you guys,
it does make my brain try to fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think rocket fuel is the perfect name
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is beautiful and it was a perfect
choice for some pre podcast dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the main topic of the
podcast, I want to talk about Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people were able to
listen to episode 321.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some people haven't listened yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher was having an issue with people
being able to download episodes via an
[SPEAKER_00]: Android phone or device and using the
Stitcher application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a long technical explanation
given to me by Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized how we could fix it and I have
made corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were not able to listen to the show
on Stitcher for quite a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already said this in another episode,
but I just want to make sure that I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize to everybody who was unable to
hear the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you rely on me for your grow
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand a lot of people sent me
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have met, may have read your email on an
episode you could not even listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got every episode up on YouTube now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you missed anything on Stitcher,
you can either go to the Stitcher website
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can listen there or you can go to
YouTube and you can listen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize, but everything is backed
up somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you missed it on the app,
you can still listen through the Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just open a web browser, go to Stitcher
and you can listen to the show there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you shouldn't have that problem
anymore because I have corrected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my problem is that people that missed
the show on Stitcher may have just
[SPEAKER_00]: abandoned me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by my Stitcher numbers that my
audience isn't what it used to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher and I couldn't figure out what
was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were simply not able to download
the show so they could not listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, maybe those people disappeared and
they won't come back because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think the show is accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would really help me out is if you
guys, my friends and family, if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out and maybe post a tweet or an
Instagram or a Facebook post saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, Rasta Jeff is back on Stitcher or
check out Rasta Jeff on Stitcher and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just post a little link to the podcast or
something and let everybody know that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're back in business and we are
accessible again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I really wanna do is reach out and let
everybody that abandoned the show or feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like the show abandoned them, I wanna just
let them know that I'm available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pass your Mondays and Thursdays by
with some entertainment and some grow
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's quit rambling about old
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have skipped it at the start of the
show, but I do need to give a huge shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my friends at PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a new PL Grow Minder unit to
make sure you know the temp, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit of your grow room,
you can find my friends at PLGrow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get you all set up with the PL
Grow Minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you need seeds for your garden,
you guys, I always recommend dankseed
[SPEAKER_00]: .store.
[SPEAKER_00]: dankseed.store is the place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a fresh drop of sun kiss and I
know they've got the strawberry starburst
[SPEAKER_00]: in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out dankseed.store for all of
your irie genetics, feminized and regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, let's do a podcast all
about harvesting your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done an episode about determining
when your plants are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done an episode about flushing your
plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is harvest time in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things we need to
think about before we go in and cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I should mention if this is
your first time cutting down cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you thought they smelled strongly
when they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you cut those fuckers down,
it's gonna double in smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like I may be making it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow one plant in a small house,
we'll say in the attic or the basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I chop that plant down and hang
it up in that attic or basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stink of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally you can smell it to the living
room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the living room of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you harvest, you can smell that
shit to the driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's because we're moving
in and out of the grow room more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what it is,
but as soon as you cut down that crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna stink more than you were
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things you can do to be prepared are
maybe getting some ONA gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what ONA gels are,
ONA gels are jars filled with this
[SPEAKER_00]: gelatinous substance that just eats up
odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't put out an odor, but it eats up
the odors in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you open the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to just set a jar of it behind a
house plant or behind a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got a picture of your
daughter up on the coffee table or up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the end table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just stick one of these ONA jars
opened right behind it, and that just
[SPEAKER_00]: starts sucking up all the odor out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put those by the doors and the
entryways of your house where people may
[SPEAKER_00]: come in, and that way you're sucking up
that odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, if you can't do the ONA
gels, maybe do something stronger to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're spraying lilac air
freshener, you're gonna smell lilac and
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ONA gels are gonna be your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to neutralize the odor would be
your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good idea, if you can afford it,
would be a carbon scrubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us have a carbon filter that blows
air out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that running because that's gonna
keep filtering the air and make it smell
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, get a carbon filter with a
blower on top of it and just plug it in
[SPEAKER_00]: and let that air run through the carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're just sucking stink out of
the air, cleaning up that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared, it's gonna stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something we need to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before we even start chopping down,
there's a few more things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are all of these plants going to go
once you cut them down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's plan this before we even get to
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use those circular racks
that they sell at the grow store,
[SPEAKER_00]: the multi-tiered circle racks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna be able to make a line
somewhere with string and hang them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a space that you're going to
be able to control the temperature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and hopefully keep the aroma
under control and hopefully keep light out
[SPEAKER_00]: and also keep people away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking about that around week six
or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, let's not wait until week nine to
start figuring out where these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking about that early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a place for them to hang that
you can control the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: a place you can control the humidity,
and a place you can keep people out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you're gonna have to control
that aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a place prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that if you're gonna dry
your buds, if these buds hang in your
[SPEAKER_00]: dingy, funky basement, they're going to
taste like funky, dingy basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've tasted that smell on buds before
and you probably didn't realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: why does this taste like the damn
basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was dried and cured and hung
for seven days in somebody's funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: damp, dirty fucking basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have some air exchange, have some
temperature control, and have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a good environment for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten them this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not ruin them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a grow hut and you
don't have another crop coming up right
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it, why not just use that grow hut
as your drying space?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not be a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're controlling that environment
already anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a good environment, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk more about the space in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just use the grow room if you need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have another crop coming up,
just use your flower room or move the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into flower, use the veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll get back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the things we need
to prepare for before harvest time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need a few tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black or the blue, thin, nylon gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrile gloves, they don't have to be
super thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to not get sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you're trimming weed and
when you're harvesting and handling this
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of weed, you're going to get
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to wear just a long sleeve
over shirt that you could take off when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have an allergy to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend, if she rubs up against
a blue dream plant, she's going to break
[SPEAKER_00]: out into a giant rash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe cover yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if your eye itches, do never rub
your eye with a trichome laden finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your eye itches and you're trimming
weed, take off your gloves and then itch
[SPEAKER_00]: your eye with a clean hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've been trimming and not wearing
gloves, go wash your hands before you itch
[SPEAKER_00]: your eye or scratch your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you get resin in your eye,
it is one of the most painful experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: you will ever endure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts and it won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what makes it stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns and burns and it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you blink, you expect it to feel
better, but it's just stickier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fucking miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gloves, a long sleeve shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to need some scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend quality scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy some cheap shitty scissors,
but they're going to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend using a different pair of
scissors for cutting down the plants than
[SPEAKER_00]: you use for trimming the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're trimming, you're getting in
there and getting the fine details.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're cutting them down,
you're using brute force and cutting down
[SPEAKER_00]: tough plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some thicker pruners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some choppers to cut down a
big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big your stock is,
but you want to be able to get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and cut it down easily without hurting
your wrist, without breaking your
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like something that has got a metal
solid piece to it for cutting them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the plastic scissors for cutting them
down, metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two solid pieces of metal from the handle
to the blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also for trimming, that's when I like
the little fiskars, the diamond tips or
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to cut down the plants with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scissors, shears, whatever you're going to
use, be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to have more than one
person doing the chopping down,
[SPEAKER_00]: get more than one fucking pair of shears.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing more frustrating than
watching people stand around and not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to do work because you don't have enough
scissors or you don't have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to have a group of people
doing it, get a group of shears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know most of you guys probably have a
small garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably one or two of you and you
don't need giant bolt cutter style shears
[SPEAKER_00]: or giant fiskars shears.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been in that situation before
where I'm watching five guys wait for work
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just me with a set of shears
chopping down every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have enough shears, have enough gloves,
maybe get a few different sizes of gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go buy a box of gloves,
buy two, maybe three, get small,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium and larges or maybe small,
large and extra large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on who's coming over to help
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to have people
helping, if they're going to be harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: and trimming with you, maybe you want a
few different size gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have applied any pesticides,
to your cannabis plants and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut them down and have other people
work with them, maybe you should politely
[SPEAKER_00]: let those people know what pesticides were
applied to your plants so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: wear long sleeves, they can wear a mask,
they can dress appropriately based on
[SPEAKER_00]: their decisions, based on what pesticides
you have applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things don't bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things I would want to put on some
long sleeves for and not get that on my
[SPEAKER_00]: arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just personal preferences, safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always polite anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing we should talk about is
how are we going to hang these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the next thing you gotta buy is
something to hang them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use, so the grow store
sells this really nice hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about three feet around and it hangs
in the middle and then it's got four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five shelves on it that you can just fill
with buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's acceptable if you want to cut your
buds into small pieces or your branches
[SPEAKER_00]: into small pieces and hang it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just fine, but that's not the way I
would prefer to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to hang the branches so that the
buds aren't touching anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they don't get a flat spot,
so that there's not a spot where air can't
[SPEAKER_00]: flow around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just prefer to hang them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Colorado we're allowed to grow six
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we've got a six plant harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get six coat hangers or clothes
hangers and then I would get some fishing
[SPEAKER_00]: line or some thick hemp twine and I would
anchor that to two opposite ends of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just got a nice piece of string
hanging across the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can hang the plants on that string
if you want to, but if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple strains, maybe you've got six
different plants, maybe you've got giant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, that's when you can cut the plant
into smaller pieces and put it on the coat
[SPEAKER_00]: hanger and you can label the coat hanger,
this is all sour tangy, this one is all
[SPEAKER_00]: black cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have one long line of
buds that get confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it makes more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you're going to need is some
sort of labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to get just some white duct
tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always just peel off a piece of
duct tape, write on that, stick it
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you want it, or you can get some
real labels or you can improvise however
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to, but you're going to want
labels if you've got more than one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing worse than getting shit
confused right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some way to control the
odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a place thought of and prepared
where you can control the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity, the lights, the airflow,
the aroma, and the security.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that all prepared and you've
got the proper tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got something to cut it down with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got something to hang it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the room just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need, I would recommend,
a humidifier and a dehumidifier and also
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of exhaust fan to get the stale
air out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a small space, you can probably
just crack the door open, but if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot of plants in there, you're going
to need to exchange some air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to get that humid air
out of there or the plants will never dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just get stagnant and funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I may recommend a small fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want air blowing directly onto
the buds, but you want to move that air
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't want it stagnant and funky
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to be able to control the
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're going to need something to
tell you what's going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thermometer, a hygrometer, perhaps a PL
grow unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something in there so you know
what the temperature is and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is so you can adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it feels like we've talked a lot about
what to buy and how to prepare,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's talk a little bit about the
settings in the room since we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about all this equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put a humidifier and a
dehumidifier in the room and I set them
[SPEAKER_00]: both at 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know that that room is staying
right around 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can set them up to something like a
PL grow unit, or if you can set them up to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that'll trigger them to go off
and on based on certain parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them both at 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the dehumidifier work to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that humidifier work to 50% and keep
that room at 50% humidity as consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it may be a good idea to have some
sort of exhaust fan in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing major, just maybe a little
four-inch exhaustor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do it, if you can just suck the
air out of that room, occasionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would get that old, stagnant,
funky air out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is not an option, open the door,
put a fan by the door, just make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: air exchanges occasionally so you don't
get old air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now inside this room where you've got your
dehumidifier, your humidifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some air exhaust, try to keep it
somewhere around 70 degrees in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 to 75 degrees will be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any hotter, you're gonna speed up the
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also gonna get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna increase humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any cooler, the room will start getting
too dry and your buds will get crispy too
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your humidity under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put a small fan in the room,
perhaps on the floor, just to keep the air
[SPEAKER_00]: moving around, or up high in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it right in the middle
blowing on the plants too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna create a dry spot and just
dry out some of those buds too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wanna move the air around so it
doesn't get stale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually get one of those fans that would
sit on your computer desk, just a desk
[SPEAKER_00]: fan, it's a little tiny, like a 12 or 14
inch fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in the corner on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small room, that is
plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that sounds like we've got a
pretty good idea of a dry and cure space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, a small room or a grow tent
that you can control the environment in
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can hang those plants in safely,
securely, and in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to use a small closet,
you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that door gets opened and
those buds don't get stale in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like I mentioned earlier,
if you don't have sufficient drying space,
[SPEAKER_00]: go ahead and use the flowering room that
you flowered the buds in, or maybe move
[SPEAKER_00]: your next round of plants from the veg
room into that flower and use your veg
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow tents always make nice dry and cure
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a five by five tent,
you could easily dry your whole harvest in
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a three by three tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need that much room to dry your
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, hopefully you need a 10 by 10,
but that's not gonna be logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we know what to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what supplies we're gonna need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a safe space set up for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've been flushing your plants
for 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more thing we should do before
we get to chopping these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they are still standing up,
we should go and take off all of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf that you can break off with your
hand now, just go ahead and take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't need leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're about to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this seven, five, three days
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it right up before the moment
you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start taking off all those big
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just go in and throw them right
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start tearing leaves off,
throw them right on the floor and sweep up
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're done, because there's gonna be
a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tear off all of the leaves you can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna save you time when it comes
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna cut these plants down and let
them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those long leaves are just gonna dry
on there and be in the way and smell funky
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're a sticky bitch to work through
once they dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much easier to get off now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just snap them right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: De-leaf this shit out of the entire room
before you cut down any of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they are all pre-defoliated,
that's what I call it, the pre-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation, then it is time to start
chopping down these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know how big your plants are,
but this is basically how I chop down a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kneel down, or if it's on a table,
whatever, I walk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually kneel down to one knee and I
grab the plant right above where I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: cut, so I've got the stalk just a couple
inches above the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my loppers or whatever you wanna
call them, your pruners, your sheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get in there and cut right above the
dirt, right below my hand, chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's gonna fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna timber on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got a little plant, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in a three or five gallon pot,
I got this by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a bigger plant, I will ask
somebody to help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, hold the top of this,
because when I cut it, it's gonna fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: timber down on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would get in there and cut it right
at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got maybe a tomato cage or
some trellising or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe figure out how to get the plant out
of there by cutting from the top down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to cut the whole plant out in one
piece and hang the whole thing upside down
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it all dry in one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've put the plant in a screen of
green or a tomato cage, you may have to
[SPEAKER_00]: start at the top and cut out individual
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you keep each branch of
each strain together so that you don't mix
[SPEAKER_00]: anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier how frustrating that
shit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mix stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So separate your plant, free your plant
from its tomato cage, free the plant from
[SPEAKER_00]: the trellis however you need to,
then chop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you've got the whole plant chopped
down in one piece, I get a fuzzy stick is
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can use the twisty ties that come
with your trash bags, because I never use
[SPEAKER_00]: the twisty ties on the trash bags anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always end up for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrap the twisty tie around the base of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it securely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a branch in there, because it may
slide off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tie that to either your coat
hanger or the line that you're gonna hang
[SPEAKER_00]: it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the line hanging across the
room, attach it to that securely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang it on there in a way that you know
it's not gonna fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to cut it down into
branches, try to cut to where you create
[SPEAKER_00]: little V-shaped intersections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hang the plant upside down,
you'll see the little wishbone-shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: intersections that you can use perfectly
to hang your branches on your coat hanger
[SPEAKER_00]: or on your line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut the plant, flip it upside down,
and just hang it in the size of sections
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to cut your plant down into
smaller sections to make it fit,
[SPEAKER_00]: make the sections similar sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they dry at similar speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one big piece and one little
piece, that big piece is gonna take longer
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry than the little piece that's gonna
cause unevenness, and you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: confused on what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chop everything if you're gonna chop
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it all hang in one big piece if you're
gonna let it hang in one big piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut the plant at the base or pull out
the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang them on the coat hanger, either by
using the twisty ties and securing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the coat hanger there, or just by using
the V-shaped intersections and hanging it
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little hook on the V-shaped
intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just get everything hanging safely in
your drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop everything down and just go hang it
all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be super excited now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna wanna go post all your social
media about how you just took down your
[SPEAKER_00]: first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is some old school advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post any pictures or talk about your
harvest until it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going out for retail, if it's
going into your jar, into your safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't talk about it while that shit is
hanging in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't talk about it while you're trimming
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't talk about it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, it's hanging in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to Walmart and you post
back to Facebook also, someone's going in
[SPEAKER_00]: your back fucking door and getting all
your weed and they're gonna trim it for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're never gonna see any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't post yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're chopping down multiple
strains, carefully, carefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully label these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll recap a little bit because I feel
like I went fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab it right above the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna flip upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either put one branch over your line that
you're gonna hang it on and let it hang
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a label on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or put it on a coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just slide the one branch through the coat
hanger so where it's got one arm through
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's just hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on the coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cut it into smaller pieces and do it
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label the coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna hang there for somewhere
between five and 14, maybe a couple more
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen them go more than 14 days
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on the coast where you've
got humidity, you may get some more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've chopped them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the lights, temperature,
humidity, and airflow all controlled in
[SPEAKER_00]: your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're just gonna have to wait
somewhere between five and 14 days for
[SPEAKER_00]: those sticks to start snapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bend them, you just want them to
go crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to just crumble up
like a whole bag of Doritos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want them to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a bunch of moisture in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And check a few of them before you get
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they start snapping consistently,
that is when the dry phase has ended and
[SPEAKER_00]: it is time to work yourself into the cure
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did skip the part about putting them
on the dry racks that I talked about you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get from the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow store sells these dry racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a 22 inch kick drum head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're about 24 inches around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're meshy and they're kind of cheap,
but they work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just hang it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, I would probably take the
buds off of the sticks and just put just
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds into those racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't put the sticks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the sticks are gonna take up a
lot of space in there and they also get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in the fucking netting a whole lot
and they're a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cut every single bud off of the
stick if it were me and I would lay the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in there and I would spread them out
kind of far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every morning when I wake up,
I would go in there and just move those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds around and kind of shuffle them
around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the ideal way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand that some of us are
limited on space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you've got to do,
that's what you have got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather see you hang them until
they dry and get a little drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as the stick snaps,
then get it off the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand that sometimes you've got
to improvise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of being a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to adjust, adapt, and improvise
with what you've got when you've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are so fucking spoiled now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got these giant facilities with
parking lots and security cameras and
[SPEAKER_00]: loading bays and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started doing this,
you couldn't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't have your friends help you
carry your grow shit into the house
[SPEAKER_00]: because now they know you're growing and
they're gonna want something or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna fucking steal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need more space, you just call
a contractor and you get a building permit
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just build out another room and
you've got a dry and cure area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would catch people drying their
fucking weed in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, I got a pissworm at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, bro, you can't pee here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I just got to pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, bro, you can't pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you catch on later that he was
drying and curing his fucking weed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I got rambly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dry racks are cool if that's what
you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would prefer to hang it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd prefer to hang it whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd prefer to hang it until it starts
snapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, that's when we enter the cure
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you didn't have time or the
forethought to start defoliating your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before you harvested, don't be
afraid to go in there and take off all the
[SPEAKER_00]: excess leaves while they're hanging upside
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is never too late to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like I can
re-crap, re-crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's re-crap what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a recap would be better for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the appropriate tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the appropriate equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to control the
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want people getting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to control the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna need some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna need something to hang your
plants on and you're going to need some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing more than one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to start pre-defoliating
if you can get in there and take off the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chop down process is fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab it, chop it, hang that motherfucker
upside down and let it start drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what temperature and humidity we
need to keep the drying cure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want about 50%, about 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let those plants hang for four or five
days and start snapping the stems and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be five, seven, 10, maybe 14 days
before they're ready to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we're gonna jar them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're gonna put them into
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the cure process is gonna
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've got a good grasp on how
to harvest our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step in harvesting, you guys,
is to get in there and clean and reset the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be time to buy new bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be time to change your air
conditioner filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is certainly time to clean the cover on
your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also maybe get in there and scrub the
lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got glass lenses on your ducted
hoods, it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time to get in there and scrub
that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that everything is nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the room with a cleaning product,
maybe some bleach, maybe some Fizan,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and clean the shit out of the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in the corners, get in all the spots
you've been missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on using your grow room or
your grow hut as your drying space,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good excuse, but you're gonna
have to clean it as soon as you're done
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as those plants come out of there
and you're trimming, you should take a
[SPEAKER_00]: break and go clean the shit out of your
grow space before you put more plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the completion of your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also the completion of your
harvest lesson, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next episode, I have a guest
scheduled, so there will be another
[SPEAKER_00]: episode before the dry and cure episode,
but there is an in-depth dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: episode coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also talk about trimming a little
bit, and then I think we're gonna continue
[SPEAKER_00]: with grow lessons and we're gonna start
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go right into germinating
seeds and cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting a grow started all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of fun things planned out
for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stick around, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will enjoy what I have planned
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I wanna give some shout-outs.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am going to
wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure if I will do a Thursday
episode this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got plans to record an episode in
Denver on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably won't be able to get that
prepared until Monday, so that disrupts my
[SPEAKER_00]: recording schedule a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I may miss a Thursday
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the first Thursday that I've
missed since I started Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to put together
something just to have it prepared just in
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to an episode Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see me Thursday, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just catching a quick break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Denver to record Wednesday and I
got overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episode will probably come out Monday
and everything will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you guys and I still love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, I didn't break up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for letting
me ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me.

don't know what I would do without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's all I've got for you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give a huge shout out to my
buddy Decker Doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
Thanks for watching.
