[SPEAKER_03]: I actually met you like two or three times
before anybody else had the pleasure of
[SPEAKER_03]: really like knowing.

bunch of girls came from the back and gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me a giant hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, we've heard about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this is like one of the

[SPEAKER_03]: L-Y-D-Y-A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come up with a good name for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: All day long I was posting about this
podcast and I knew Lydia was going to be
[SPEAKER_10]: here, but I didn't know what to tag her.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just didn't put her in the picture.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't that I don't love you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you do love me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's easier than just her name also?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most simple tag you can find.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have done hashtag.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's throwing up hashtag gang signs
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the gang sign for hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my new favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lydia, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for always treating me great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of you that I kept coming
back to this place because there are tons
[SPEAKER_01]: of glass shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, dude, I love you,
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always have.
[SPEAKER_03]: From like the moment your immense height
walked into the building and I realized
[SPEAKER_03]: how really small I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think you're average.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm just above average in height.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I thought, I thought I was like
teeny.
[SPEAKER_13]: We pride ourselves on our customer
service.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that makes me really happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys do a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ladies do a great job.

Elevate stores?
[SPEAKER_13]: One.
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently one and there's about to be
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're going to change things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only seen one male ever that has
worked here ever before.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Brandon is his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: How'd he do?
[SPEAKER_13]: Was he all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were all, it was the day that
I came and it was super busy and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: hung out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had like, you know, I had nothing to
judge him on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a high five and we talked about
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love fucking with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other ladies that usually work
here that we should give a shout out to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Heidi and Mac Daddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mac Daddy, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss Heidi.
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss all our counterparts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heidi's a tall one with the dark hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tattoos and the beautifully like
ornate artwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only had the pleasure of working with
her once and she's kind of quiet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she is super great.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's really unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until you get her out of her shell,
then she's, she's not so quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll get her out of that shell.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's super smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like she teaches me shit that I never ever
would have any idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did she teach you?
[SPEAKER_03]: That mycelium is actually the real word
for mushrooms and that they're growing
[SPEAKER_03]: under like these giant interwebs under the
ground and that they feel everything and
[SPEAKER_03]: like mushrooms are the birth of
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're only 50% away from being having
the same DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know that?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's all about music shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Google that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I called BS.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, are you for real?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to put the mics down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my computer right behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to go Google some
mushroom stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll catch up with you guys a little bit
later.

[SPEAKER_13]: And she has like some, um, like slav
slave, however you say.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the right letters, all of the right
letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have taken a bunch of dads and
Rebecca doesn't dab, but I think a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of us blew them at her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think she, she, her eyes are a
little pinkish.
[SPEAKER_12]: She might be a little medicated now,
but she just made some psychedelic,
[SPEAKER_01]: some rub that you can rub on your arms and
get, and get psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she has some energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She definitely has some energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not tried that magical slave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny's heating up a nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, she did work at that creepy,
um, uh, the adult arcade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a porn store and an arcade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that a shooting gallery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right by the black sheep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was swift.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I kind of wish I wouldn't have said
that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it a shooting gallery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look on Rebecca's face is priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk more about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this got weird really quickly.

Colorado native Colorado native born and
[SPEAKER_13]: raised.

logo around it a few times.

going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mouthpiece has the elevate logo with
the Colorado C with the seed coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.

[SPEAKER_01]: It's good now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to throw a giant party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I was asking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to throw a giant party.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really all we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not really in it for like the big to
do and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might just do it one day randomly and
then be like, Hey, by the way,
[SPEAKER_03]: this happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hang out and take like dabs about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take dabs about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take dabs about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: High five.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're married.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great union.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, honestly, he's a really great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Becca's kicking off her shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting cozy here in Elevate
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're literally the only one with shoes
on at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, these are, yeah, I don't know
how this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those look like new shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are pretty new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of snug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, that's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting them off right on for the
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, now it's like a, it's Elevate company
slumber party now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're down for chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hot tub time machine on one of the
TVs back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got a glass blowing video on the
TV over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, how did I not notice that before?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the making of my piece basically
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to look away because I could just
stare into that all day and just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: watching and there won't be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be a narrative of me watching this
guy blow a glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, that dab of the orange stuff you
gave me really got me super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Incredible Extracts is- Shout out
to Incredible Extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I met Derek, the extract artist at Secret
Sash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, at the Secret Sash?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's tall like you.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's very tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the height difference between you
two?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I mean, you're both pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am six five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say five foot 17 to confuse
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's about- Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't like, I'm not, I'm literally
not surprised at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would walk away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too much math.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I'm not signing up for that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five foot 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, how tall are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Five 10, five 11.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're five two over there sweetie.
[SPEAKER_03]: We the five two gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go with five seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haha.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we like comparing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Becca always wins.
[SPEAKER_10]: She does.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why she is queen.
Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was going to say something
about her great breasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still, I'm avoiding her great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I say it, it's creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say it, it's cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to- What?
[SPEAKER_03]: About your great breasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just make eye contact and behave
myself.
Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is funny.
You're funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to hold the microphone next
because it's my turn to take it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us, you came here with your
fiance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a purpose when you headed out
here or just new life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually I got my degree in business
management in Pennsylvania and I had my
[SPEAKER_03]: cosmetology license.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could move out here and do that if I
wanted to, but low key I worked in a head
[SPEAKER_03]: shop in the town that I lived in and it
wasn't super progressive at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the dude didn't want to carry like
wax stuff, but, um, he was a hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like a legitimate, like from the
beginning, my old boss in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say not Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, not my fiance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're absolutely correct in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, anyways, it was,
uh, it's what I really, I loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what I was always a part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, when I came out here,
I met queen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my life has been this ever since you
guys make a great team.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way that you've set up the
store and then the dolls and the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: the dolls rep the store perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you guys do all the social media
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't do it without them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got the best team, but you know,
we got to mention that there's also higher
[SPEAKER_10]: elevations.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of this family.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, before I came here, before I met
Lydia, I did get a rig repaired at higher
[SPEAKER_01]: elevation masterpiece productions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I Googled who can fix my glass on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first place that came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I drove there and they told me I
needed to make a deposit and drop off the
[SPEAKER_01]: rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they fixed my rig, they would
charge me the other half of my payment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they didn't, they would give me a
nice deal on a new purchase from the
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt that that was super fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they called me in about 10 days and
they said, Hey bro, come get your rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rig is straighter now than it was
when I got it from the original artist.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do tend to make glass look better than
it came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it when my dab nail,
uh, points up at an angle because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting hash on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to stay straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I put a lot of oil on a nail and the
amount of oil I put on there, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: tilted at all, it will run off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need it straight up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that rig was a little crooked before I
broke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's perfectly straight up and
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: My oil stays on there perfectly.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You broke it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus you found higher elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't be sitting here right now if
that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's segue over to the event that granny
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be a perfect time since Lydia's
over here taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, October 1st, that that's a Saturday
coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: October 1st.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is really a great event.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really actually elevate is going to be
part of this as well, but there's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be, I'm going to kind of read off the
flyer because I'm pretty impressed with
[SPEAKER_10]: this event.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's with a DBK glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now they have 32 Colorado
blowers that are going to be blowing glass
[SPEAKER_10]: that day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they're going to auction off those
pipes and all that money, all the proceeds
[SPEAKER_10]: are going to go to the Institute for
research on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I get the accent on the right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's going to be a chili cook off
as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's going to be people making
chili.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of it's going to be medicated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of it's going to be just regular
chili.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be from nine 30.
[SPEAKER_10]: To I thought I saw a time.
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 PM is when they're going to start
judging, uh, the glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So each glassblower is going to be given a
lot of amount of time to, to make a piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm telling you, there's like
glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 32 glassblowers that are all allowed a
certain amount of time to make a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, they're going to
raffle that and give that money to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is going to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, the glassblowers,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Dr. Dabbs, Zombrie glass,
Wazoo glass, higher elevated, Boro Mojo,
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebels glass, low glass, the glass parrot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, our very own silver surfer Steve is
going to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dave the slave.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Matt's blowing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I can pop D, blazing trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is our friend chosen one going to be in
there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pop D is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Josh, Josh Kabler Brown.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Brent Thackeray is going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be so many local
glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's October 1st.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the location?
[SPEAKER_13]: SSV Steve's birthday that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silver surfer Steve's birthday party also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's invade it and make it his birthday
party.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys party up, bring them a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the location dabbing granny?
[SPEAKER_10]: The location is down.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on El Paso.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: 2833 North El Paso.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, chef brother luck is going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in Colorado Springs, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, where is, where is it at?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give them kind of directions?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like, um, if you go Nevada to Fillmore,
you're going to go right on Fillmore and
[SPEAKER_13]: then El Paso is going to be on your left
hand side.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of by the Jimmy Johns.
[SPEAKER_10]: DBK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's going to be out in the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just thrilled that you guys will see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drive to the right direction,
you will find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good chance I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Food truck is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's going to be food as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just going to be a great
event there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I would say it's kind of like a
cannabis family event because glass
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing is always fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Glass blowing is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never seen anybody make glass,
it's an amazing thing to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take a rod of solid glass and they
turn it into something you can smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this room I'm sitting in, uh,
I can't even describe this properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are probably a hundred different
styles of glass just within my view that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can tell a hundred different artists just
twisted these up their way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's going to do it their way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing that everything in front of
me started off as just a rod of clear
[SPEAKER_01]: glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we have another event we want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think October 22nd, there's something
going on here in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about something.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably going to be the bee's knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bee's knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they still say that?
[SPEAKER_13]: They do now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bee's knees.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to party till the cows
come home.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a corn lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: October 22nd.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: October 22nd at the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be having a heady Halloween
party.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to have a costume contest.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have pumpkin carving
contest.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have a dab bus.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have dabbing fucking
granny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I say?
[SPEAKER_13]: You can say whatever the fuck you want on
the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can say whatever the fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an adult show.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we're going to have live glass
blowing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have tons of decorations.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have a photo booth.
[SPEAKER_13]: Live music from Snow Lab, Groovon,
the E.T.'s.
[SPEAKER_13]: About eight or nine locals are going to
play.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have a photo booth with
props.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be playing scary movies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tickets are only $10.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Becca, where do they get those
tickets?
[SPEAKER_13]: They can get the tickets at Elevate Glass
Gallery, which is downtown on Tejon and
[SPEAKER_13]: Cimarron.
[SPEAKER_13]: Higher Elevations, which is Powers in
Omaha or at the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing online.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you can get it off the Black Sheep's
website, I do believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can get anything off the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, I will most likely be at the
event October 22nd.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they gave me a ticket and they're
staring at me like you better be there or
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to burn you with the dab torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you what my costume will be
because I may be in a costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, you're going to be incognito.
[SPEAKER_10]: How will we know it's you, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be giving away over $2,000
worth of stuff for these prizes,
[SPEAKER_13]: guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_13]: Glass, yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come dressed to impress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start a new dab band.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of our band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: October 22nd, guys, at the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of glass prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bring an extra backpack or something
because you're going to win some glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need to take home a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what kind of glass?
[SPEAKER_13]: SSV Steve is going to make a Halloween
themed piece for the grand prize.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to talk him into making like a
pumpkin perk.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hashtag pumpkin perk.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, very UV.
[SPEAKER_13]: UV is very spooky.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's good at UV.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, lots and lots of prizes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably some vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our listeners aren't in the dab
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be from Oklahoma or Australia or
wherever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like you're driving to Colorado for
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I want to teach them about UV glass
really quickly because UV is kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the newest things that's
popping up on the glass scene right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Illuminati.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny's passing the mic over to Lydia
because I think Lydia maybe our UV expert
[SPEAKER_01]: might be what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that you?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, she's just dabbing.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's totally the UV expert.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm totally not the UV expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UV they put, I don't know what they put
in the glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's radioactive salts.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Becca knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put radioactive salt in the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make a glass pipe with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you turn on your black light and
your glass glows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is crazy looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks radioactive, you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: It only glows under UV light though.
[SPEAKER_13]: It will not glow in the dark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Only UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes enough sense to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have something to add though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, no, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not what I'm adding.
[SPEAKER_03]: My true obsession of UV is because I grew
up in the 90s and I did those damn fuzzy
[SPEAKER_03]: posters that glow under black light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had several black light accessories
in my fucking awesome bedroom when I grew
[SPEAKER_03]: up on a cul-de-sac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it look like Spencer's threw up in
your bedroom?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wasn't that like kind of douchey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I did, I had like four lava lamps and
I'm really would like to start acquiring
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do have a dabbing lava lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you've got the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit your dab lava lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, yes I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I like the UV glass because
it's like an ode to the 90s like time that
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's just like black light and it's
dope and I'm smoking from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting really stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like putting together a bunch of
parts of, you know, the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm still like a child.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just about to say how old are you and
you're feeling nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I'm an old soul, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 22, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis has brought, there's somebody
from just about every generation in this
[SPEAKER_01]: room right now because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: 22 years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: But look at how smart she is.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's on the right track.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, these young people just
amaze me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't they, you Jeff?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you're not as old as me,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ross Cola, King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Barefoot Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are 10 years younger than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look at their girls,
shit, shout out to the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are 10 years younger than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I look at their stuff, I'm like,
holy shit, those guys are killing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they work with these young
extraction artists up in the canyon up
[SPEAKER_10]: there and the medicine they make.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like I say, this Incredibles is
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: You buy that medicine from the homies.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is really good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Incredibles is made by somebody
younger than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's younger than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: D is, I'm certain that D is a few years
younger than me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're very proud of their girl
because any product you and I both know
[SPEAKER_10]: comes from the grow and they have a good
product.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see how clean it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: The frozen monkey, any of their rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it frozen monkey?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's funky monkey.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's fresh frozen monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that makes more sense to me than
frozen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we've got the sour band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
fresh frozen and the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: the frozen and the not frozen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since, uh, Becca had a couple of questions
about it and these ladies had questions
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you being the big expert,
I love to dab it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting to know the difference in the
products I like.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really seems like this fresh frozen
keeps the turps in as we've talked about
[SPEAKER_10]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any of our turp men here
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference is we're cutting down
the plants while they're, while they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cut them down, trim them up just a
little bit, take off the big leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: throw those in a freezer and freeze them
up completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell the whole world what you
just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we freeze the plants completely and
then we put the frozen material into the
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably the top of the concentrates
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, the distillate and the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on where you are and
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the live resin, the distillate
and the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a shatter guy myself because I like to
take giant dabs of shatter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen you take some pretty big globs.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get this sappy stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you need a shovel?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can be one of those skillet shovel tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a honey wand almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so sappy and goo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually that's the CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBD makes it really, really runny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that orange soda is pretty sappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you dabbed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you only dab like occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she got mics.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, mics for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's in stereo, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a mic in each hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Becca's on some dabs right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's double fisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's definitely catching a buzz for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's double fisted.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've dabbed once in my entire life and
that was out of a 12 foot dab straw with
[SPEAKER_13]: dabbing granny at one of my parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was your only dab ever?
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, did you know that that was her
first dab ever?
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because Becca is my friend,
I thought I should turn her on to some
[SPEAKER_10]: good medicine like the orange soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably about a third of a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's like a my size dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was pretty fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you take a nap?
[SPEAKER_13]: I went and hid for like two hours.
[SPEAKER_13]: Incognito.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I came back out and I was super
fucking high for the next 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we did like three shots of Patron and
we drank some beer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be the boss, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm pretty sure you caught a nice
little buzz hanging out with us tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had a bad time with granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the podcast that didn't work was a
good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Dabagail over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite stuff to dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I do like some live resin or some
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we got to explain that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some live resin will sugar up
sometimes it'll get, it looks grainy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks real like sugar granules,
like golden honey sugar granules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I find that to have a lot of flavor
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, I'm not really sure how it's made
exactly, but I do appreciate it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like big dabs or little dabs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like 0.3, 0.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like 0.3, 0.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she's stepping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, half gram dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: For your birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is it your birthday?
[SPEAKER_02]: My birthday is on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're going to have to come do lots of
dabs for Dabagail's birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wish her happy birthday on
Twitter and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: She already shouted out her stuff earlier
at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you tell this young lady,
happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast won't come out till Monday,
but you can retroactively wish her a late
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get some dabs going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want to do a half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my hands full, but I'm going to make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that wasn't as bad as it sounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that all came through on the
microphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, you know, we know a few glass
blowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If things get broken, I know where to take
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to tell you yesterday what I
did.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the privilege of hanging out with
our mutual friend, Rasta Jeff,
[SPEAKER_10]: THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we went up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: And his friend, Josh, who they went to
college together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, he came with us, but we went to Denver
and I went to a few new dispensaries up
[SPEAKER_10]: there that I'd never been to before.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I went to THC magazine,
the office.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really feel like I need to narrow right
in the heart of downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause dude, she is going to be wrecked.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Sam and I are going to start something
up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be doing either a podcast
or a broadcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: She said she's excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: She really doesn't know what she's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_01]: This young lady is about to take a point
three, maybe a point four over there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's about point four.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a pre-birthday dab for Ms.
Dabigale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm causing pain to Dabigale already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Lydia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will let you narrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just cause I know Dabigale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a big one for her?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's dropping it in the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like puddling and it's a lot of
delicious low temp thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's hitting the Rasta themed Elevate
Recycler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody made her laugh because yeah,
holy cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got the carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call that a success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's without a doubt a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: No cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of a 10, I give you an 11.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't change any colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That amount of coughing is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not even going to deny it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no way Becca does not have a
contact.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just smelt that dab all the way over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually the Pineapple Jack Nug
Run Shatter from Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked that up over at Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at Green and
Healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Lindsey?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're having a great shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this at work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Lindsey, the traveling
stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a shout out to Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast is not the same without her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: She came in here and got rollers and she
was one of the most delightful people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about how she hung out with
you at the secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, she is really, really
delightful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was actually a really funny story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't find the roller.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was literally right in front of my
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't stoned or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really ask for forgiveness for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is I wasn't even really
stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a max capacity of stoned and I was
not at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, she was really, really
delightful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really delightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsey's one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a good best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite people on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Bobo Blaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to get back to the ice cream
incident that I saw happen over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what are you guys doing on my
microphone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't disrespect my microphone like that,
ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to sanitize everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally didn't lick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't touch it with my tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Becca said they made it more valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They increased the value of my,
it's christened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With our present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our close proximity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are so lucky you didn't go to high
school together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we probably are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been troublesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about us in high school
actually the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We very much were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lydia, sometimes I tend to have to
explain things to her like trap house and
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started talking about house
parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was like, house party?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, because somebody used it as a
form of measurement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was like, oh, how many people were
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, oh, well, it was like a
house party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I don't know what that
means still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Davagan was like, oh yeah,
okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how does that make sense to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one, the size of groups smaller
than the black sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, everybody understood that reference.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: What if you have a small house?
[SPEAKER_10]: What if you live in one of them damn tiny
houses?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're all coming over anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it came because my brother
had fit 74 people into like a bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: section of a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom didn't wake up the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were 74 people in the basement.
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they give your mother?
[SPEAKER_02]: She had just gotten her top teeth taken
out and got dentures put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was done for the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four days she was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So house parties.
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of being out for four days,
let's just shout out to Max at TNT
[SPEAKER_10]: Instruction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he get you, granny?
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: His bacon.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're a vegetarian, so you
wouldn't know, but his bacon is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he gives me bacon every time I
see him and I remind him that I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he gives me dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, here, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about all the bacon I've given you.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just met him a few, you know,
a few weeks ago was the first time I met
[SPEAKER_10]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me two separate 1000 milligram
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'm not sure if I wanted to be
his friend after I ate the first one that
[SPEAKER_01]: made my life difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand milligrams is like,
I described it as putting ankle weights on
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was a challenge all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took me three days because I ate six
pieces of that bacon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then two of those cookies from that
guy that was standing there, 450 milligram
[SPEAKER_10]: cookies each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you were flying granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were sedated.
[SPEAKER_10]: I took my husband to the military doctor.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is like, what's wrong with you,
Gail?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you so sluggish?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm so tired.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really didn't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then by the end of the week,
I was like, I know what was wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ate way too many edibles.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to tell you a funny story about the
military hospital.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were there Monday and we were walking
to the elevator and a little soldier in
[SPEAKER_10]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_10]: He must have been about 25 came running up
to me and said, I know you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said, yeah, let's get in the
elevator though.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as soon as we got in the elevator,
he said, can I have my picture with you
[SPEAKER_10]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't taken a selfie granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to do that before we
leave here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely going to have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that we've hung out like three
or four times now.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no selfie of us because we always
enjoy each other's company.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't think about getting the phones
out, put our phones away and have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a selfie with Rasta Jeff,
is that called a Jeffy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've always wondered.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a selfie on a rooftop,
is that called a roofie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my joke, but it's funny either
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to Lydia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does she go?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, Lydia, you couldn't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have podcaster bladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcaster bladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a special thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like truck driver bladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is her first podcast though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys are wonderful on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope you guys are back on another
podcast.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hope to be on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my equipment learns to behave itself,
maybe I can record a little bit from the
[SPEAKER_01]: event on October 22nd at the black sheep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to bring this little recorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get it fixed because everybody that
listens to the show knows that this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: gave us some issues and I don't trust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get it fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring it to the one on the 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring one or two microphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about the event live from the
place while we're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you cold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're freezing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to turn the air on to get the cloud
of dabs moving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to think of a tactful way to
say that without busting you out on having
[SPEAKER_01]: the front of the store nice and cloudy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is you and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the pizza guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time we hung out together,
they had to open the back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something happens when we get
together, granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: We seem to... They open the back door so
the smoke alarms and the place didn't get
[SPEAKER_10]: shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the recent change in the
rules at the cannabis clubs here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that, granny?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: This podcast is going to air before
September 21st.
[SPEAKER_10]: September 21st, I want a show of force at
the courthouse here in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're shutting down our cannabis clubs
again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I want you to come out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to speak.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just going to show that we support
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want you to come acting like adults.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want no silliness.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can't come like professional
people in the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_10]: please stay home.
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's show these clubs that,
no, we support you and we're not going to
[SPEAKER_10]: let the city shut you down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know the next step.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to shut them down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they're going to come after our
grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: Us, our caregiver groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already doing that here in
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've limited how many plants you can
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've shut it down to a number of
plants where several of my friends who are
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans and patients are unable to grow
the medicine that they need for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their option was to go possibly to
these clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they can't even go to these clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clubs are no... So you guys,
what we're talking about is the clubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are no longer allowed to consume
cannabis in these cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are no longer allowed to reimburse
them for product that they may provide for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to do away with all of this
social consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we need these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that without these places,
we have to go smoke in our cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go smoke in the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go smoke in the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go park in front of somebody
weird's house and take a couple of dabs in
[SPEAKER_01]: our car, drive onto another weird house,
park in front of there and take a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's hard as shit to drive and dab
in the city when you're on a lunch break.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you think some of these guys are
going to go back to hanging out in the
[SPEAKER_10]: bars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that's what a lot of people
will do, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I myself, if I didn't have cannabis,
I would probably drink alcohol and I am no
[SPEAKER_01]: good at alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm no good at it or if
I'm really, really good at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think anybody is good at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we were leaving that event in
Denver a few weeks ago and we drove
[SPEAKER_10]: through the bar by the bars in downtown
Denver, first thing we saw was a drunken
[SPEAKER_10]: female.
[SPEAKER_10]: Her boyfriend pushed her.
[SPEAKER_10]: She was so drunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: She fell into the intersection.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was four or five other drunk
shouting obscenities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just thought, I hate alcohol.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at an event with people with
cannabis that left.
[SPEAKER_10]: They all left smiling and hugging and
everybody was happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: High-fiving each other, feeling good,
not going to be hung over tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to drive into stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Intensive free.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't we have our places to
congregate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other thing we need to push for,
Jeff, is, you know, they're coming after
[SPEAKER_10]: our medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they trying to get rid of medical?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what started the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need medical marijuana for the
patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all want legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of us do, but we're kind of being
fooled.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch the right hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't pay attention to the left hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to give you legalized,
but we're going to make it wreck.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what if you're truly a patient that
truly, truly needs medical?
[SPEAKER_10]: More than likely you are on a fixed
income.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a hard time affording your
medicine to begin with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so now we're going to add a 47% tax or
more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not right at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not what our system here in
Colorado was designed for at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not just Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see it happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: First, it happened in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's moving next door to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to happen here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think eventually we will have a
nationwide cannabis program that is run by
[SPEAKER_01]: one governing organization that takes care
of all the marijuana?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what our governing bodies
want.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look how much money can be made.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons of money.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that doesn't mean it's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I see the cannabis community going the way
of the family farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to go away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what are you going to have to
choose from?
[SPEAKER_10]: Look here, Jeff, we sit here, we have all
this great medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it becomes what the government is
leading us to, you'll have a strain of
[SPEAKER_10]: indica maybe and a strain of sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be icky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walmart packaged very regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't be your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, no, it'll be some GMO stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: You will continue growing, but then we're
back to breaking the law, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all I can say is we keep pushing for
what we've been pushing for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the medical in your, if you have
medical where you are, don't get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it medical is where it all started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I always say in almost every
episode, when we talk about social clubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are writing legislation in your
area for cannabis use, make sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: include somewhere to consume that
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you include social lounges or
social clubs, somewhere that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase and consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: With your friends like responsible adults,
because that's very much needed when you
[SPEAKER_01]: do legalize cannabis in a new area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Learn from us here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are, you know, we've always been,
everybody's had eyes on Colorado as far as
[SPEAKER_10]: the cannabis goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are learning this was something they
slipped through and we just didn't pay any
[SPEAKER_10]: attention.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we thought, you know, okay,
we've got our clubs while we were walking
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of in a gray area.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now the city is not liking us any
longer for lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess they want tax money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about tax money.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for 49 minutes and most
people usually give up about one hour into
[SPEAKER_01]: a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should start saying goodbye to all
of the lovely people that have listened to
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask one more question as we
go around the circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, you'll be first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hang on to your microphone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One simple question, Indica or sativa?
[SPEAKER_10]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Becca, do you even care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just pick one randomly or just?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, when I smoked, I...
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I do smoke, I choose sativa.
[SPEAKER_10]: You smoke flower, don't you, Becca?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she smokes flowers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I didn't even think of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot all about the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shame on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, shame on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Abigail, Indica or sativa,
honey?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like both, but I prefer sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to act like you're like
choosing sides or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to go to war.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel like you just, you're like,
oh, sorry, Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no apologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Lydia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica or sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all of you guys for coming
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you for letting me come
and hang out in the front of your store
[SPEAKER_01]: and take dabs and eat pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the pizza guy once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Customer service like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies, thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, thanks for putting this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was all your idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad it happened.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really am.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, granny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny messaged me and she said,
hey, I'm going to bring Rebecca and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go to your house and do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: at your studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that sounds like a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, well, she closes the store
at eight and then she's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, wait, she closes the store
at eight and all the buttons in my head
[SPEAKER_01]: started pushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, why don't I go to elevate
where the dabbing or the elevate dolls
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to call you the dabbing dolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you dabbing dolls?
[SPEAKER_03]: We totally do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the elevate dolls are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this worked out very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was given a sweet gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fed pizza and I got to hang out with
some lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_13]: And elevate is spelled E-L-E-V eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it's five 17 South state,
hone in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's an Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one of you runs that?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you see all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: All of the people who work at the store.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have a website as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you elevate glass gallery.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also make sure you check out higher
elevations, masterpiece productions,
[SPEAKER_01]: their sister store.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much glass in that store.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nine years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine years over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Birthdays, October 1st also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys make sure you come to the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, remind us the date of your event
that you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: October 1st down on El Paso.
[SPEAKER_10]: At DBK.
[SPEAKER_10]: DBK glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be like 30 plus local
glass blowers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And lots of dank ass chili.
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't forget.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds scary.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to, we're going to surprise
them, but it is SSV Steve's birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: SSV Steve.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's behind the scenes a lot, but he's a
good guy in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then October 22nd at the black sheep.
[SPEAKER_13]: A heady Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heady Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come in costume.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dress the best to impress and win some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Party with the elevators and all our glass
blowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rasta Jeff will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have my recording gear with me part
of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear there will be a dab bus.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_13]: And hula hoops.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's going to be cold and the black
sheep won't allow us to consume inside.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to have a bus parked in the
front so that we can dab safely and be
[SPEAKER_01]: warm and cozy because the bus is private
property and is not involved with the
[SPEAKER_01]: black sheep or their liquor license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the separation and the unity work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to see all of you that are
listening to the show at the black sheep
[SPEAKER_01]: at the birthday party on October 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be in costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be really hot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take off my mask and he'll go,
there he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to taking a dab with you on
the dab bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can put somebody on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell us what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys need to start like a vocal group.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, someone's at the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little chihuahua at the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good way to wrap up the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dog saying shut up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are too loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to wrap up this portion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back and we will put a tail on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.

accessory of any type, if you need a new
[SPEAKER_01]: nail, a new banger, a new case for your

[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my ninja, Spence,

[SPEAKER_01]: give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are having a great
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're taking some dabs with me,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you've got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you've got a blunt rolled up with
some hash down the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing something to adjust
your vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're getting nice and iry with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took some big fat dabs of some
taffy and Cascade Nug Run Shatter from our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually kind of had a sort of a
pineapple aftertaste to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you hear this, it'll all be
sold out because they sell that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: really quickly over at Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, in this episode, I'm going to
address some emails that have been sent to
[SPEAKER_01]: me and some questions that I received on
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a really good question that I
have titled, The Turp Sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about why
somebody's got some sizzling turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, before we get that
far, I do need to make a very special
[SPEAKER_01]: announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about getting my hash at
Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I was known as the
master grower or the lead cultivator or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call it at Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am no longer involved with Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm friends with everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt and I are still bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amy and I are still bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a chick, but we're still bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay and I are definitely still bros
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breezy and I were never real close bros,
but I mean Breezy and I are still bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got no problem with the Green and
Healthy Crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just no longer a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am moving on to do different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to focus more on breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to focus more on my stuff instead
of working for another company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem with those folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely appreciate the opportunity
they gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a different vision and I want to
do my own thing to tell you the damn
[SPEAKER_01]: truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm no longer part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love to that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the entire Green and Healthy
Wellness crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure that everybody
knows I am no longer a part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of emails and questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me a lot of things about the
commercial growth from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to be straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am no longer a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell am I doing since I'm no
longer there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on my breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I have got some, I've been
talking about the show, the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project here on the show recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is about 50 days into flower at this
point, which means it's probably close to
[SPEAKER_01]: 35-ish days since it has been pollinated,
which means in about seven to 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 14 days, I'm keeping a real close
eye on it, I will be able to chop these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants down and I will be able to harvest
the seeds as soon as the plants dry up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull the seeds out and then I'll be
able to let them dry a little bit and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll package them up and I'll get them in
a few of my friends' hands and we will see
[SPEAKER_01]: what a RISE F2 has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what comes from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got a Grateful Dog female
pollinated by the RISE male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to see what that's
going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Lemon Skunk pollinated by the
RISE and of course I did the Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated by the RISE in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds will be done in like 15 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds are getting chunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pulling, I've pulled three seeds
out total so far just to do investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just get a seed in a normal
spot of the plant, pull one seed out,
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it up, take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually tried to germinate one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not germ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just really curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we are with the breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot more breeding projects
planned and lined up and charted and in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the females are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what male I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is going to be some heat coming
up from the iRegenetics gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's going on with the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I'm going to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Elevate and the new dab rig
they gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I mentioned it on the last
episode, but they gave me a sweet dab rig
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Lion of Judah on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of coughing a little bit,
but it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have I been doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: On Monday night, I got the honor to go see
one of my favorite reggae artists,
[SPEAKER_01]: the master, Sisla Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Cervantes, Masterpiece Ballroom?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was an opening act by the
name of Dubskin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never, I thought I had seen Dubskin
before and didn't like them, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the band that played that night
that was called Dubskin was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their drummer was very charismatic and
played very creative reggae beats.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, a reggae drummer is either
boring or really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either lock in and you play reggae
beats or you kind of fill in and you do a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's one of those guys that gets on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He plays a lot of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked his sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the way he played.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dubskin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a great set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very Colorado-esque reggae is my best way
to describe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course Sisla Kalanji came on
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something happened when the bands
switched.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Dubskin left and Sisla came on,
something in the soundboard happened and
[SPEAKER_01]: the drums sounded like shit when Sisla
came on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, I'm not a sound guy,
but I obviously run a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a soundboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really bummed out when the drums
sounded like shit, but I tried to get past
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to look for the good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing one of my favorite reggae
artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to show appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get iry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to show some support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sisla puts on an amazing show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude put on, he used more energy in
an hour and 30 minutes set than most of us
[SPEAKER_01]: use it in our entire day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came out on stage in a long sleeve
button-up shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long his dreadlocks are,
but I assume they are quite long,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he always keeps them tied up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's always got his dreads and a
turban on his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got a turban filled with
dreadlocks on his head and he's under the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights at the concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's running in place basically for an
hour and a half and singing and not
[SPEAKER_01]: missing a beat while singing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dude was covered in sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like he ran through the
sprinklers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was so sweaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that dude put out huge energy,
even though he was kind of frustrated with
[SPEAKER_01]: the sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched enough stage shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell that the drummer couldn't
hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The monitor mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was falling off the beat a little
bit, trying to listen to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking up the singer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the singer was getting mad and was
kind of showing it a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was a great show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever get the chance to see Sisla
Kalanji, go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you get a chance to see a show at
Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom in Denver,
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave all your fancy shit at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to park right there with a
bunch of fancy shit in your car though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a sketchy area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, let's talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to some of the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I have received because I've been
talking about my stuff for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm opening up an email right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm unlocking the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a screenshot of a message I
received.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll quit clearing my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message came from a friend on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls himself Terps Only 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, hey Rasta Jeff,
just recently I was gifted some pure
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I've encountered these
before, so I don't know too much besides
[SPEAKER_01]: they taste great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying so hard not to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it out of my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a small dab of some other
concentrate, then drop a drip of Terps on
[SPEAKER_01]: it and it comes out great and tastes
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, the Terps make the dab
sizzle a tiny bit, not like the 4th of
[SPEAKER_01]: July Tain Brain status, but definitely a
small sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't happen to the concentrate
without the added Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this normal?
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also said, any info would be
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long time podcast listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they say, can honestly say I've
listened to all episodes since episode
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like we're the best friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been listening for that long,
we're friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been listening to Chris Hardwick,
the Nerdist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been following Chris Hardwick
basically since he was on Singled Out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen Chris Hardwick spiral out of
control and ruin his career and then get
[SPEAKER_01]: his shit back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now Chris Hardwick is on top of his
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard Chris Hardwick say several
years ago that all he ever wanted to do
[SPEAKER_01]: was play Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to see Chris Hardwick at the
Oddball Comedy Tour a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: play Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt like I was watching one of my
friends reach his goals because I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: following him for so long and I listened
to his podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I completely know what you mean about
us being friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we ever meet, if I walk past you at an
event, if we're in the same area,
[SPEAKER_01]: you better come say what's up and
introduce yourself because we're friends
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you've listened since episode
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm embarrassed when I think about episode
one, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sticking along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you asked about dab sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as long as it's not going too
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I'm going to say is you
might have your nail just a little bit too
[SPEAKER_01]: hot when you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to let the nail cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using the e-nail, turn it down
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting too much sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's happening is I'm going to pick
up my little jar of turps here and let
[SPEAKER_01]: these turps talk me through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turps are liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least my turps are completely liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm holding them in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could pour them out of this little vial
of I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are completely liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're putting that liquid onto your
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you might be using a little bit
more than necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pouring it onto there and it's
sizzling when you dab it, you might be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to put about half of that and
conserve your dabs a little bit and make
[SPEAKER_01]: it last twice as long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're still going to get the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going to get everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excessive too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do big fat dabs with way too
much turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's sizzling, that might be part
of the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's happening is you're just
putting moisture on a hot nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you would put water on a hot nail,
it would sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes in the summer when you get
sweaty and you have to manhandle your
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter with your fingers because there's
no other way to pick it up or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it dabble sizzle from that too,
because it's got moisture from your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that's happening is basically
you're boiling the turps on the hot nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they hit the nail, it's just like
you're throwing some water in a skillet
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's going tsss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just getting that sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be using too much turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just check those two things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or shit, honestly, if you like the way it
works, do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you're into, do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take too big of a dab with way too many
turps on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with your turps that
I know of from that description.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like just science happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm going to take a drink and
another dab and hopefully get rid of this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing in my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be cool for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for dealing with my coughs,
my throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was talking about turp sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you have too much of a
problem there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three books that you have found a lot of
good information from or have heard good
[SPEAKER_01]: things about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love going to the internet for answers,
but the problem with the internet is that
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody can post anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find a lot of bullshit posted on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see people giving people advice that
is just going to lead to more problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not getting to the root of the
evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, Hey, I've got this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well then do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Oh shit, that's just going
to make the problem you've got even worse
[SPEAKER_01]: and cause three more problems down the
line that you're not aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to teach new growers to avoid the
internet a little bit because the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: can be really full of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way to go is trusted books from
trusted authors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know three books,
I would highly recommend the first one I
[SPEAKER_01]: would recommend for everybody is called
marijuana botany and advanced study,
[SPEAKER_01]: the propagation and breeding of
distinctive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's a really long title,
but if you go to amazon.com and you search
[SPEAKER_01]: for marijuana botany by Robert Connell
Clark, you will find that book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less than $20 with free shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the book I would start with
marijuana botany by Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would go with another trusted
classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go with the marijuana horticulture
indoor outdoor medical growers Bible from
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge is kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, both of the authors I've told
you about are kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of the authors I'm going to tell
you about are kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've started growing cannabis and
breeding cannabis probably before I was
[SPEAKER_01]: born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys have been doing it for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of their techniques are very old and
they seem a little outdated, but this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has been around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys were doing it right back
then and this shit still works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like karate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to learn the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start off as a white belt and your
goal is to get that that crystal the green
[SPEAKER_01]: belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to start off as a white belt,
get these books, get a good foundation and
[SPEAKER_01]: then build on that from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first book again was marijuana
botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second book is the marijuana
horticulture indoor outdoor medical
[SPEAKER_01]: growers Bible from Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep updating that book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can find it on Amazon for
like 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the third book I would recommend is
Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is actually the Oakster Dam course
guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the book that they use at Oakster
Dam in California to teach people how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow cannabis professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This book is very in depth and I really
liked the way it's laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It teaches you the basics of how to set up
a grow, excuse me, how to set up a grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to maintain your setup, what size of a
grow to set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It teaches you about how to find males and
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: It teaches you about cloning, vegging,
flowering, teaches you how to look for
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs, how to identify bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers
handbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also known as your complete
guide for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one, I'm looking at it right now on
Amazon for 23.99 with 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: $4.99 shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if I shopped around a little bit,
we can find it for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the first three books I would
start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a book by Soma that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have the book sitting next to me
right now, but it's a small thin paperback
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis book from Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then DJ Short also wrote a book by the
same publisher that Soma's book is out
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's also a book called Let's Grow
a Pound, which is a very useful book in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Let's Grow a Pound from
Seymour Buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that book would do every grower
some justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes from day one of the grow all the
way up to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very helpful guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm thinking about it,
let's throw in a book called Secrets of
[SPEAKER_01]: the West Coast Masters by a dude named
Drew West.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be plenty of books to get you
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a lot of those books on PDF
form for free on the internet somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick search and you should be able
to find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those books will be available on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions that you
need answered with more depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you need more interaction,
feel free to send me more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know my email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my favorite books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to part two of your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part two of your question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have read that digital ballots can mess
with and disrupt radio signals like ham
[SPEAKER_01]: radio and wifi cable reception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know this to be true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard you are all right as long
as they have something called an RF
[SPEAKER_01]: shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says, thanks again for the
love on the show and keep dabbing and
[SPEAKER_01]: sipping on that drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny because I said I need a
little sip one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew somebody was going to give me shit
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about digital ballasts that
mess with and disrupt radio signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do put off a frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that frequency matches your TV or
your radio, it could definitely cause
[SPEAKER_01]: interference or be picked up by something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is most of the digital ballots
available work at a much higher frequency
[SPEAKER_01]: than what most personal electronics would
work at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of them are in the 200 range and
most of your personal appliances are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 60 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should not have any problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it does happen, you were usually
using a lot of ballast like more than 15
[SPEAKER_01]: or 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be enough ballast to disrupt
some signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when you're getting imported Chinese
ballasts that are poorly made from other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries and they have a lower frequency
vibration and those will be more likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that people are worried about is
that they're putting off an RF frequency
[SPEAKER_01]: and that frequency is able to be picked up
by law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes a lot of people paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the new ballasts are made with an
RF shield inside of them and they're at
[SPEAKER_01]: such a high frequency that it will not
disrupt your household appliances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not disrupt your Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, that was a thing,
but they've kind of solved that problem
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: An alternative to the new digital
ballasts, you could go with your old
[SPEAKER_01]: magnetic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with those is it's hard to
take good photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make your pictures look like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either have the digitals and you
can be paranoid about the RF frequency,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can have those old magnetics and
you can take shitty pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really don't think you have anything
to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the new ballasts, you should be
just fine in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge article on THC Farmer about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to read about it on THC
Farmer, that's where I did my research.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those guys bicker about it,
but from what I read, I think we'll all be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay with our digital ballasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, dude, I truly appreciate your
interaction and your emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep dabbing and sipping on that
drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep sending me good emails like
this, I appreciate your message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to see that black cherry kim soon
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a long time ago, I did a breeding
project where I had a reversed golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a golden goat that was a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I applied silver thiosulfate to it for
about 14 days before I put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I continued applying silver thiosulfate to
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This golden goat plant became a male that
produced male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put female plants in that room so
that they can receive that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I timed the plants differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants go in early, some plants go in
later for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the girls looked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a clone of headband in that room to
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a female and it looked okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as the pollen from that reversed
golden goat plant hit that female headband
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, that plant shriveled up and died
overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know what caused it because all
of the plants in that room got treated the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feed was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of water they got was basically
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was overfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was underfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was over or underwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything seemed legit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The temperature was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't bugs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, when the pollen hit
that plant, the whole plant fucking died.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what caused it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to other breeders about it and
they all scratched their heads and looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at me like I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I don't know if something
else was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what happened,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy said he had something similar
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said his killer male plant shriveled up
and died within 48 hours of entering the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any idea on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you took a male plant from a veg room
and then you put it into the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: room to initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within 48 hours, it straight up
croaked and died.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know offhand what would cause
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few guesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I would like to know was that
plant, is this a soil or a hydro grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I'm really curious
about because soil is much more forgiving
[SPEAKER_01]: and hydro, you have more option to damage
the roots and everything happens much more
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly in hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would explain a little bit more if
it were hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my main questions, did it go from like
a T5 light to right underneath a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: watt light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that may have been a little bit
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have just fucking microwaved it or
barbecued it or broiled it, however you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have just put that little tiny
plant that came from a T5 or a little
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you moved it to a thousand and put the
thousand too close, you might have roasted
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have just overpowered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't ready for all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave it too much energy and it died.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have gotten too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have had too little light also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have gone from your thousand watt
in your veg room where there was only that
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had all the space and then you put it
in the other room and it was not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you hid it between a bunch of girls
and it didn't get enough air.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe it got too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it got too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it got too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you carried it into the flower room
or when you put it in the flower room,
[SPEAKER_01]: did you get excited and overwater it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, this sucker is going to be a
beast and you overwater it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you overfeed it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did it need nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could walk into your grow room and
look at the room and the other plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another question I need to ask
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do the other plants look?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have other plants in that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have females in there that look
happy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the females in the room look
happy, then it's just this one plant we
[SPEAKER_01]: got to figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if all the plants are shitty,
then it's the room we have to figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could walk into the room with
plants and see what's going on in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could just walk in, take a quick
look around the entire room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at your ducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at your lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at your source of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how you're getting rid of the old
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how you're handling humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things I would like to
see in there that would help me answer
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I'm not able to view your
room through my brain yet in the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be so handy when we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just teleport to your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check it out right quick,
tell you what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to send me some pictures or
send me some follow-ups to all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that I just said, I will talk about
it further on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what's going on because it is
really strange that you put a plant into a
[SPEAKER_01]: room and it died within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check on all the things that I asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably checked all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound like an experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably all the stuff you went
to right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was hydro and you moved it from
another room to another room, I'm assuming
[SPEAKER_01]: there was some root damage is what caused
that plant to die because last night I
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanted a medium amount of clones
from an easy cloner into solo cups with
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and I got kind of hasty and I was in
a hurry and I felt myself kind of fuck one
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I pushed the soil down, I felt it
press too hard and I've kind of felt the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, that plant's all drooped over and
looks really pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may pull through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can spare that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like having 100% success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have 99% because of that
fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just a little bit of root damage on a
hydro plant is a huge difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: happiness compared to just a soil plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't mess up the roots as much on a
soil plant is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the bottom line is I really don't
know what caused your plant to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had a better answer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope you had a clone of that male
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, you just got to get some seeds and
do some more pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you email me back, let me know what
strain you were working with and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds you went through to find that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got questions for you also,
and we'll talk about this more on a future
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Artie, I want to thank you once
again for that email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to hear back from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I received two emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was about LEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's light emitting ceramic lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new 315 seemed to be really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company that makes the 315 is just put
out a smaller version, a lower wattage
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't paid too much attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to do some research on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I got an email about LED,
light emitting diode lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you guys, I've never grown with
an LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never grown with an LEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used some T5s and some thousand watt
HBSs and some thousand watt metal halides.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I've grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some fours and sixes,
but I mean, I've never done anything other
[SPEAKER_01]: than high intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to find the people that make
the 315s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you can put me in touch with
the guy that makes the 315s, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_01]: get him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let him know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have him email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I can find him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I would like to have somebody that
represents, manufactures, or works with an
[SPEAKER_01]: LED company, or somebody that has grown
with LEDs a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like you to come on the show and teach
us about LEDs and maybe run us through the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences of LED lighting and HID
lighting, because I honestly don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in that department.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a pro with that and you're
able to articulately tell our listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: about that stuff, I'd love to get you on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've got for you about LECs
and LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got a
question you'd like me to talk about on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the next episode, we are going to talk
about a recent cease and desist letter
[SPEAKER_01]: that was sent to the cannabis lounges in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will also answer a few more emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I want to thank everybody that
sent me messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer it if you sent me the
messages at growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way to get in touch with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're already corresponding on
Instagram or wherever it is, keep doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But new messages, I would love to get
those at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that is the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please send me more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love building content based on your
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lets me know I'm hitting my audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets me know I'm helping people out
with information they actually need
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of just talking about random
things that aren't helping anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy, John Randall's Jr. John Boy,
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen you in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing well, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to
sponsor the podcast or if you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: product you'd like me to review,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it one more time,

[SPEAKER_01]: review section, type in a comment,
let me know what you think about the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I will read your comment on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when you're there, you have the
option to give me some stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'd ask for a five-star rating.

[SPEAKER_01]: Click on some stars, type in a comment,
let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'd love it if you guys follow me on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got
for you this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back in a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence,
and until next time, take a fat dab and
[SPEAKER_01]: give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I am going to talk about a recent,
[SPEAKER_01]: a cease and desist letter that was sent to
all of the cannabis social lounges in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get to that, I want to
answer some emails that were sent to us by
[SPEAKER_01]: some friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just get right to that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came to the Grow From Your Heart
Facebook page, and this one, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if she wants me to say her name on the
air, but I am going to read her message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all the info you share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it when people send me
messages, and I love it when people tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me that they love the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about trim machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to like my answer,
but there's not a trim machine that I
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a fan of hand-trimmed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think connoisseur grade cannabis should
be trimmed by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a whole bunch,
if you've got a large outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: I might see you using a trim machine,
but honestly, I can tell the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between hand-trimmed and machine-trimmed
cannabis, and there's nothing like
[SPEAKER_01]: hand-trimmed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why grow your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have them for,
what, nine weeks in flight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then probably four to six weeks,
maybe eight weeks in veg, maybe longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how you do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 13 weeks, 14, 15, 16 weeks you've
got these plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not take the time to trim them by hand
and love them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's tedious and it kind of sucks
sometimes, but it's so worth it in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my big thing is when you use a
machine to trim your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it turns that trim into like a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cuts it at too many different angles,
too many different times, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: basically a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you mow the lawn and you've got that
bag of clippings and it stinks real funky,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've kind of mulched up all of your
cannabis leaves and they're releasing too
[SPEAKER_01]: much moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reaction that's happening in
there because it's cut so many times and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's stacked inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how the grass stinks real bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, your trim will start to do that
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times when you're getting shitty
hash from the dispensary, it was possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: made, and I can't guarantee it,
but it was possibly made by material that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from the trim machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I helped my buddy Kevin get started
making his little hash company,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an extract guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was giving him material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used the kind that looks like a giant
salad bowl and it's got the grill in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of it and you put the top on it and
you spin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It trimmed the shit out of some of my
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my buds had just mangled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew some kush that was like rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It trimmed that okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some lemon skunk that had some
fingery buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just cut the shit out of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't like that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I'm getting is I gave the trim from
that to my buddy Kevbro and he ran and
[SPEAKER_01]: made hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash was terrible and we couldn't
figure out why.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took it to Denver with us one time on a
trip and we showed a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy's like, dude, did you use a trim
machine to make this hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: He called us out right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made green shitty hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one major reason why I don't like a
trim machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should be trimmed by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can trim it by hand and then you can
use all of your fine trim to actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: some product out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do whatever you want with it,
but if you use a machine, it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, if you're going to put
that much time into growing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: into drying it and curing it, why not sit
around the table with whoever's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said we are growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming there's you and probably a
spouse or a partner or whatever you call
[SPEAKER_01]: it these days and maybe a couple of
friends, maybe a roommate or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys should all sit around the table
and trim it up, talk, have a good time,
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have, but I'm saying that's
what should happen in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it gets overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great trim machines,
but there's not one that I can recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: because I stay away from them and I hire
humans to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, that's my a hundred percent
honest guidance on trim machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody out there has a trim machine
that they think trims to the quality of a
[SPEAKER_01]: hand trimmer of a person, send me a
message, send me a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know about these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's shit that I don't know,
enlighten me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to be on the knowledge team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can share that information with
the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think about trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got one that can compete with my
quality trim, growfromyourheart.hotmail
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy sent me like a multi-choice email
and it won't open, but I'll make it open,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it won't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, email.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just says podcast topic,
the freedom of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about trading?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it legal to ship cuttings to legal
states due to low THC content?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do I feel about trading strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if you've got a clone and I've got
a clone and I want what you've gotten vice
[SPEAKER_01]: versa, like baseball cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I love trading strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten some of my best strains by
trading stuff before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having a good baseball card.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That specific cut could be like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a baseball guy, but I listened to
enough Greg Proops to know that like a
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey Mantle card would be worth some
shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I had a satchel page baseball card,
I could probably trade that for a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I've got that one good cut,
like back in the day, if you had Girl
[SPEAKER_01]: Scout cookies around here, I could trade
my Girl Scout cookies forum cut for almost
[SPEAKER_01]: any cut that anybody had.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gorilla Glue is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Grateful Dog, I will not let that out
to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have offered me ridiculous trades
for my mother plant of my Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't let it go, however.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I totally love the freedom of
trading strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should give strains away also.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give people clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend start a grow recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave them shit tons of clones just to
get them started.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should give away and trade clones and
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a pack of seeds,
if you've got 20 seeds and you only want
[SPEAKER_01]: to run 10 and your buddy's got 10 seeds of
something else, trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he also said, is it legal to ship
cuttings to legal states due to low THC
[SPEAKER_01]: content?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot speak on shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know anything about shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the legalities of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly avoid shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to put anything in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of a paranoid old hippie on that
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really put anything in the mail
unless it's absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't speak too much on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if you're shipping hemp plants
from one legal state to another,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably okay, but isn't the
shipping system isn't that owned by the
[SPEAKER_01]: government?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that federal?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably fucking up somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your question continues with people
slash clubs buying and renaming genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: selling breeding rights, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me touch on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: People and clubs buying and renaming
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hate it when I give somebody a
clone and they grow that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know that they harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like a little while later,
they've got a bag of something that smells
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly like the clone that I gave them
tastes just like it looks just like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're calling it some different shit
because they want to take some credit for
[SPEAKER_01]: it, or they want to make some extra money
off of it by calling it something
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is frustrating shit right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it what it is, or the clubs will do
it also.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clubs, somebody else will name
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have medical marijuana here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people really like specific
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people really dislike other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know that I'm going to say sour
diesel, if sour diesel works well,
[SPEAKER_01]: for you medicinally, you want to go get
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody just named some shit on
the shelf, sour diesel, and you go spend
[SPEAKER_01]: your money on it and you get home and you
smoke it and say, you've got Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe this is just hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Parkinson's disease and sour
diesel makes you quit trembling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just spent your hard earned money
on this eighth or this quarter of medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: and you went home and you probably took
all day to get that bowl packed and you
[SPEAKER_01]: finally smoked that fucker and you thought
you were going to quit shaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: but guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some asshole just mislabeled some weed
because it would sell if it were called
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to do what you need
properly for your medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you just kind of wasted your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably wasted an Uber ride or a
drive over to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit sucks when people in clubs buy
and rename genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that everything needs to be left
at the proper name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to speak out against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really dislike when extract companies
take two different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now I'm not going to call out
the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to talk about what I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some Curious George live resin in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of a strain called Curious
George, but there's some bananas and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably some gorilla glue or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just blended those two strains
together and called it Curious George,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I mean that's creative, but they
didn't breed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they get to name that hash blend,
but I think it would be better if they put
[SPEAKER_01]: like what Turpex did on this container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpex printed Taffy Plus Cascade Nug Run
Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't put an X to make you think
it's crossed because if you put Taffy
[SPEAKER_01]: Times Cascade, it makes it look like it's
a hybrid of that because that's how a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Turpex does it Taffy Plus Cascade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know straight up what two strains are
in this hash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I've got a friend who,
if she smokes too heavy of a sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: she will have a panic attack right in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She might piss her pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll have to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets ridiculous if she smokes too much
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cascade in there, that would be too
much for her head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she knows straight up not to buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This other one, it doesn't say what's in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she doesn't know if she can even smoke
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she probably wouldn't even waste her
time buying it to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it sucks when people rename
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we need to keep the names
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Budtenders or somebody in the
dispensary, I think that the jar should
[SPEAKER_01]: say, and let's say maybe they have Lemon
Jeffery on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should say Lemon Jeffery,
and then it should have a lab test of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, maybe CBN, CBG, and THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those need to be listed on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then underneath Lemon Jeffery,
it needs to tell you the genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon skunk and golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to let you know that that's the
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also should have the sativa or
indica or hybrid marker, which is a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: nother conversation because everything's
pretty much a hybrid these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, but you can have things
that lean toward the indica and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I think about people
renaming strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I give you seeds or clones,
you better call it that shit when you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it just to keep it true because what if
somebody breeds with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're really fucking things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really throwing off the family tree
and we got to keep the cannabis family
[SPEAKER_01]: tree in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of our job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself as a breeder, that's really part of
my job is to keep it true to where there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a history in a family tree so that we can
look back when things get different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be kind of a preservationist,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your email goes on to say, more cast on
genetics and origins, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to talk a lot more about
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics and origins, but the only things
I would really feel fully comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about would probably be strains
that I bred because they're the only ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would know the true origin of
because unfortunately a lot of the popular
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts, there's a lot of lies and
misinformation and bullshit based around
[SPEAKER_01]: the origins of those cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know where Gorilla Glue came from
because Josie Wales bred that and told us
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know where Golden Goat came from
because Mr. Dank bred that and told us
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, but there are a lot of lies and
rumors and untrue stories about things
[SPEAKER_01]: like Girl Scout Cookies and of course the
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably 20 different stories
about OG Kush that I've heard and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to talk about where I think it came
from too much because I feel like I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: diluting the true story since I really
wasn't there and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to talk more about origins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one day I'll talk about some of the
strains that I created since I can tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you where they came from and I'm certain
of those and I won't create any bullshit
[SPEAKER_01]: stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made a note of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you once again for sending
me those messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: That message came from a dude called That
Heavy Slim Guy on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to That Heavy Slim Guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love getting messages from everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to send me a message,
I would prefer you shoot it to me at
[SPEAKER_01]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the email address is the easiest
way to keep it organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most reliable and I will find
your message there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're already corresponding,
on Facebook or Instagram or wherever we
[SPEAKER_01]: might be talking, just keep sending me
your messages there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue the conversation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to start a new
conversation, please hit me up at
[SPEAKER_01]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do like making content from all
the messages I receive from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets me know that I'm hitting my target
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets me know I'm talking about
something you guys want to hear about and
[SPEAKER_01]: it always gives me good content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at the start of the show, I did say I
was going to talk about the cannabis clubs
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado Springs receiving a cease and
desist letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pulling up a website now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pulling up the Denver Post website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this article comes from the Colorado
Springs Gazette.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not give an author name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will get into the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give credit, but there's no one
to give credit here besides the Denver
[SPEAKER_01]: Post and the Springs Gazette.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine, Colorado Springs cannabis
consumption clubs received cease and
[SPEAKER_01]: desist letters from the city clerk's
office last week in the first crackdown
[SPEAKER_01]: under a ban on the clubs enacted by the
city council on March 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: The club sprang up after amendment 64 was
passed in 2012, legalizing adult sales and
[SPEAKER_01]: use of recreational marijuana,
but banning public consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clubs gave people a place to use
cannabis and socialize in private.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs outlawed sales of
recreational marijuana in the city but the
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs got around the ban by providing pot
to their patrons for a reimbursement
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could either trade cannabis for
membership or sign affidavit saying the
[SPEAKER_01]: club was growing the customers legally
allowed six marijuana plants for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me back up and talk about a couple
of things on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs outlawed sales of
recreational marijuana in the city of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did pass recreational marijuana,
counties were allowed, counties and cities
[SPEAKER_01]: were allowed to decide if they wanted
recreational marijuana dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_01]: their county or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of places said, no, Denver has a
lot of recreational marijuana available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo has recreational cannabis
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs is right in the middle
and they banned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that the city got around it or
the way that people got around it was by
[SPEAKER_01]: opening up these cannabis clubs and
working on what they called here the
[SPEAKER_01]: reimbursement model, which means you can
sign a paper that says you're a member.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably pay a cover charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can walk into that club.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they've got some cannabis and you
want to smoke it, they won't sell it to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll give it to you, but you've got to
reimburse them for the electricity that
[SPEAKER_01]: they spent and the time that somebody
spent trimming it and whatever they feel
[SPEAKER_01]: the product is worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to reimburse them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that they made that legal was
these people would sign over their legal
[SPEAKER_01]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Colorado, when you get a medical
marijuana card, you are allowed six
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pay a larger fee or you can talk
to your doctor and he may give you what's
[SPEAKER_01]: called an elevated plant count where you
can grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will offer up to 99 plants in some
cases, but you'll take your medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana paperwork and there's a spot
where you sign your provider and you will
[SPEAKER_01]: make whoever runs this cannabis club would
now become your provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that place is legally pseudo kind
of allowed to grow your six plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go there, you walk in and
you're already a member there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're able to consume products that
are there on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since they came and made these new rules
and sent this cease and desist letter,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is how it used to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, although the city officials view
such actions as de facto sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: the practice has continued.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ban passed in March, however,
says the clubs cannot sell, trade,
[SPEAKER_01]: give, distribute, or allow the transfer of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're technically not allowed to be
reimbursed or sell or trade cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot give cannabis away,
which is kind of weird because what's a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis social club without cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say that we can't consume it in
there right now, but that was part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: new rules was we couldn't consume in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the ban gave clubs that existed
before September 23rd, 2015, eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: to phase out their businesses and effort
to help the owners protect their
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But under the law, every owner had to
submit a consumption club application and
[SPEAKER_01]: a $200 fee by April 29th to get a one-year
renewable license for $90 plus
[SPEAKER_01]: registration fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only five clubs applied by the deadline.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was approved, two were under
consideration, and two were denied.
[SPEAKER_01]: The denied clubs, along with seven other
identified clubs that did not apply for
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing, have been ordered to close
because they are not licensed as required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now guys, I talk about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I talk about cannabis
consumption clubs, we talk about the Canna
[SPEAKER_01]: Canyon or the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are writing legislation for your
area, if your state or your locality is
[SPEAKER_01]: invented, and writing and creating the
laws for medical or recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in your area, or any type of cannabis use
in your area, please include some type of
[SPEAKER_01]: safe smoking area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a consumption club.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a place where adults can go and
congregate and consume cannabis safely
[SPEAKER_01]: like adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that come from all over
the world to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody 21 and over can drive to Denver or
Pueblo, and they can show an ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they've got some money,
they can buy some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once they leave that dispensary,
there's nowhere safe for them to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smoke in your car because you'll
get a DUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smoke at the park because that
is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't roll up a joint and walk down
the street and safely smoke in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what we did here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nowhere practical or safe to
smoke the cannabis you just bought at the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to your hotel, and a lot of
hotels make you sign a paper when you
[SPEAKER_01]: check in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says that they will charge you $250
to $500 for cleaning your room if you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke cannabis in there because they think
you're going to fuck that room up $250 to
[SPEAKER_01]: $500 worth of stank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better have some good weed if it costs
$500 to get the smell out of that hotel
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nowhere practical to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need these consumption places,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're writing this legislation
and writing the rules, please be sure to
[SPEAKER_01]: include that because that's where we
screwed up here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have it pretty well, pretty good
if we didn't skip that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what really sucks, you guys,
is I'm passionate about this because a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of my friends own these businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel for every owner, how are my
friends that were promised eight years to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue doing business, to recoup their
assets or recoup their investments,
[SPEAKER_01]: how are they expected to pay their bills
now that they're not allowed to work on
[SPEAKER_01]: the business model that they have designed
and been operating on?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not allowed to reimburse for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not allowed to give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not allowed to trade it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no transaction involved for
cannabis, which honestly was a large
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of these people's revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how are they going to pay the rent?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm recording, the first is creeping up
on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know hopefully these businesses have
more than one month of finances put aside,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to buy products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to pay vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to keep the lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently some of them are growing
products somewhere, which costs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil costs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything costs money when you're doing
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making money costs a shit ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are these folks, how are my friends,
how is our community going to pay their
[SPEAKER_01]: rent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that they are not allowed to function
under their business plan, I do not find
[SPEAKER_01]: it fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that we can do something about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't, I would rally you guys for a
city council meeting, but it's already
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were in Colorado Springs,
please go to the city council meetings and
[SPEAKER_01]: show support for the cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something that we really need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're allowed to have bars on every other
corner where people can go and drink
[SPEAKER_01]: whiskey and beer all day and get shitted
and cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not allowed to have a place
where people can go consume some cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: peacefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't find it to be fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colorado model says let's regulate
cannabis like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to do that, how about when
we're at a baseball game or a football
[SPEAKER_01]: game or a basketball game, why don't we
have a medical marijuana smoking section
[SPEAKER_01]: or a recreational marijuana smoking
section right next to the smoking section?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to regulate like alcohol,
let's step up and do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I've been ranting for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope that you show some support
for these cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to all of
the cannabis club owners and proprietors
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody who works with the clubs to
make them happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you and I respect you and
shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you are able to continue doing
business and I hope you guys all survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know most of you are probably,
you have family, so you got at least got a
[SPEAKER_01]: damn dog in a house to take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you find a means to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it all works out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I want to wrap up the podcast with
another message.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from Year of the Gorilla on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Year of the Gorilla was the winner of the
hashtag mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody listened to that
episode, but I did the mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to find somebody in their pajamas
at a Walmart with a mullet and snap a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture and send it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude followed all of the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: He meets the criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Year of the Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some stickers coming your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this episode comes out,
the stickers will be in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The check's in the mail, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he also sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I was wondering
if you have any favorite pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: routines, like products you use in
applications and how often I know having a
[SPEAKER_01]: clean grow and proper environmental
control play a key role in keeping things
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy and happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, maybe what would you do if an
outbreak occurs and how to stay positive
[SPEAKER_01]: and overcome challenges in the grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the first part of that talking about
pest management routines and the products
[SPEAKER_01]: that I use, that'll be another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am writing an episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got notes for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a notebook filled with notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, a lot of people probably
wouldn't believe how many notes I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: and how many half shows I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of stuff prepared,
but I'm doing an episode on how to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify problems and how to treat for
problems and how to prevent problems on
[SPEAKER_01]: the list of things that we're going to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got spider mites, whiteflies,
fungus gnats, thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about how to identify
those on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about all the pest management
stuff, but what I want to get to in this
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this message is also maybe what to
do if an outbreak occurs and how to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: positive and overcome challenges in your
growth because that is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people have a problem at
the beginning of the grow, just not too
[SPEAKER_01]: far in, and they get completely frustrated
and they feel defeated from the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning and it feels like they're
fighting an uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a plant that wants to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to almost try to kill cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a problem, you have to first
identify the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to figure out how to solve
that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to put that plan into action
and solve your problem, and then your
[SPEAKER_01]: problem will be solved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you do it right, you have a
stronger sense of pride because you
[SPEAKER_01]: overcame something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can put some plants in some soil,
pour some nutrients and some water on
[SPEAKER_01]: them, put them under some lights and let
them grow for nine or 12 weeks and produce
[SPEAKER_01]: some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you have a problem that you had
to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it more fun for a guy like
myself, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's how I stay positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the mundane, boring life at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I do what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I live the way that I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think that causing some
problems and screwing up makes you a
[SPEAKER_01]: better grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't learn how to walk until you
fell down a few times, and then you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how to run until you were good at
walking, and then you fucked up running a
[SPEAKER_01]: few times and scraped up your knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to make some mistakes and
overcome them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I stay positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I'm learning something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's something going to
come out of that mistake that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I stay positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, man, you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get too upset about what you did
because you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a problem, maybe you got
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, you have to accept it because shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a crack in the wall that
spider mites climbed through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not even really be something you
could have thought about or could have
[SPEAKER_01]: done anything about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Text Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out how to get rid of those spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in whatever week, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever week you're in, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst case scenario, harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush your plants and harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just flush them out more quickly than
those bugs can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest it and get what you can out of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get something even if it's
just experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then take the steps to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then clean up the grow room and go
back at it harder than ever before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next time when you see the very
warning of spider mites in that room,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to know exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to identify it more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just going to be better at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that part of me will always know
that I'm bigger than every bug and I can
[SPEAKER_01]: find some sort of thing to destroy any
insect that gets into my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got books that can show me how to
get rid of any sort of mold or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just confident that I can take down
any problem that I'm given in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some crazy shit happen in grow
rooms before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had fans fall and chop up plants and
lights have come undone and I've ran
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had PVC pipes with, oh, I forgot how
many gallons per minute this pump used to
[SPEAKER_01]: push, but way too many gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This PVC pipe exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that a lot of crazy shit happened in a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put some reggae music on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to turn up the headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe go take a couple dabs and just get
in there and solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like anything else in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit's going to happen all the time,
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life would be way too easy if shit went
right all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I expect problems in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, when I ran the big grow and I
was training new people, they would always
[SPEAKER_01]: say, so what's the first thing you got to
do when you get here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would always say, find the surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, well, that's a big ass grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a hundred and something lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got like 50 fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get to find what fucked up overnight
while we were gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's been like 12 hours since we've
been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody just laughed at first and
they'd really realize like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: every day when we get in here,
there's some weird shit that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: find and we have to repair or handle
before we can even go about normal
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either laugh it off and just have
a good time and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move on, do whatever you got to do,
or are you going to have a stroke about it
[SPEAKER_01]: and be pissed off all day?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I choose to just have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that growing cannabis,
there's no need to really get too mad
[SPEAKER_01]: about too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for that message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really, I hope I was a little bit
inspiring and I hope I answered at least
[SPEAKER_01]: half of your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a shout out to my boy year of the
gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check your mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably have some stickers waiting for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can hear that noise in the
background, that's my boy, Mick the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's chewing on a deer antler and yeah,
here he comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mick the dog is going to find a camping
spot right here by my feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to scratch on him for a little
bit.

track.
[SPEAKER_06]: You stall and fall.

[SPEAKER_06]: But if you If you're gonna stray,

time.

life you live.

[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new

[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, to my left,
a repeat offender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, honey.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's usually white, Mike, but today he's
kind of red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike took a dab, coughed for about 15,
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still got half a cough cooking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coughs make you feel like people are
there with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it fly, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it fly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the table, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this podcast, we are going to talk
about some new purchase limits here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been restricted on how much hash we
can purchase here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they've changed some rules on some
edibles and also in Oregon, they have
[SPEAKER_01]: banned some popular string names.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, let's talk a little bit about the
secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at the secret sesh on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay was also there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had much more important things to
handle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm finally not working for a secret sesh,
and it's the wife's birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday to the wife.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: A secret sesh happens every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wife's birthday is only once a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, once a month, thank God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, happy birthday to the wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's late, but still better late
than never.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lindsay and I and a whole bunch of
other people had the pleasure of attending
[SPEAKER_01]: the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think about sesh?
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a lot of fun at this one.
[SPEAKER_14]: We kind of squatted up a little bit on
some couches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invaded some space, claimed some
territory.
[SPEAKER_14]: Took over some tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't enough tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bunch of people brought super fancy
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dino, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dino Joe P collab.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Ty had his elbow Joe Peters collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super snazzy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Max had his Matt Robinson.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a collab?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lost the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea who made it, but it was
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the shape of it is Matt Robinson.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a collab.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to re-look that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a green giraffe?
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet you Brett and Chris are both
listening to this episode screaming,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's a collab with so and so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, whoever made it, both of those
pieces were fancy fresh and these dudes
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out these fancy rigs and there's no
table.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was like a heady zoo and there's
nowhere for the zoo to like, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some staff find some table space
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a little bit of table space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Threw some hash down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got down pretty well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Ty for that huge ass dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can catch that on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time I got to hang out
with Ty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude's a soldier.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yo, Ty is insane.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Earl Tycoon on Instagram
and THC chocolates, which is his edible
[SPEAKER_14]: company as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He threw me some stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got those stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go on something cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a case of some sort.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got some of his edibles at the house.
[SPEAKER_14]: Edibles, edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of edibles, that's a good
segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it when you do that for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the secret sesh, our good friend Max
sat down next to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying not to say good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember a long time ago I was going to
say good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend Max from TNC Extraction sat
down next to me at the secret sesh and he
[SPEAKER_01]: knows I don't eat bacon and he's felt bad
for offering me medicated bacon at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: past sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he pulls out a banana pudding shoemit
bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hundred milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hands this to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, here, bro, you want this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't eaten edibles in, it's been four
or five months since I had eaten edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I broke that banana pudding bar in
half and I ate half of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did a little selfie video with Ms. Lindsay
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I passed the other half of it to
Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she split it with Bobo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am back on the edibles wagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat edibles again.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the secret sesh, which was Friday,
I ate the banana pudding bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate a couple of little smaller edibles
that people gave me like candies and such,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a caramel or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and then I ate something else that
we're going to talk about later on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Saturday I ate a 100 milligram
cloddy bear, a cherry one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, not to diss any cloddy bears,
but the cherry are absolutely not my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like the cherry one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a little bit of a medicine-y funky
aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cherry that a lot of the candy
companies use has that medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't prefer, I liked the root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got an apple one that's really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the ones that they have like a
raspberry that they actually dip in
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cherry didn't, it got me high as
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I slept like a baby, but I did not like
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't buy that one again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then today I ate from Gaia's garden
edibles, I ate a 100 milligram milk
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate cherry truffle, which was quite
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to go slow to try to say what
that was because it is obviously working
[SPEAKER_01]: on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a delicious edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm back in the edibles game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go slowly because I catch myself
just becoming way over-medicated on the
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do that to myself again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get all fucking ruined and
slow on edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Secret Session was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody that hung out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Brett, Max, and Ty for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Them three.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Twisty as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twisty is where I was headed.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Twisty.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Dwayne.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dwayne.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the dude whose name I did not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Dwayne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I know everybody's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a nice little crew there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncle Stoner hung out with us a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude in the vest that was filming
everything, that's Uncle Stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his own show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check him out if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of cool people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Hill came and hung out with our
little squad and took some dabs.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Hill holds it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really cool host.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the kind of host that'll,
there was a band playing and as the band
[SPEAKER_01]: played, he just came and kicked it with
us, rolled the backwood, hung out with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: took some dabs with the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flirted with a couple of chicks and then
skedaddled right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt throws a hell of a party.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time at Secret Session, I did
something that I don't usually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was given the VIP gift bag.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Hunt for giving us both
one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just real quickly go through the
gift bag and talk about what's in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start with the things that
are least impressive to the most
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A company called Healing Nations LLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consulting Cultivation Systems and
Nutrients threw in a small baggie of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay weed and it's not impressive
weed, but it was a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to smoke this here later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they threw in some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also next up, The Lazy Lion threw in a
real big flyer and a small baggie and they
[SPEAKER_01]: threw down a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to smoke a pre-roll
joint, that's probably a gram and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: two grams of weed in that joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I owe somebody a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally random, off the cuff here,
but somebody gave me an 18 gram joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was given an 18 gram joint that's rolled
and ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to smoke it at the secret
sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having a scattery day and I did not
take it to the secret sesh with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Charlie Torres and his son.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also big shout out to Tim and
everybody involved in Organtica down in
[SPEAKER_01]: New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys grew some arise and it tested
at 30.8%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Golden Goat Cross to the
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave them some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew the shit out of my stuff down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got two strains that have been
lab tested by Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've tested over 30% THCA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two different labs, same company,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two different labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in Colorado, one in New Mexico,
same company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link to that is both strains are
Golden Goat Crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffrey is the Lemon Skunk Cross II
Golden Goat Reversed Male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one hit 31%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the arise is the golden goat.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking full of shit right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to edit part of this
because I'm saying this all wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lemon Jeffrey is a Lemon Skunk to the
Golden Goat and the arise is Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_01]: II Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically the non-feminized
version of the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the Golden Goat parent in
there and those have both tested over 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so shout out to my friends down there
in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Charlie Torres, an
organically grown, hand trimmed,
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly cured, perfectly rolled 18 gram
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get everybody high as shit
wherever we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said they smoked one the other night
at another event and it went around for
[SPEAKER_01]: over an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get lit wherever we go
when we smoke that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't smoked it yet, but you can
probably see it from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on that table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that fucking baseball bat sitting
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed through here the other day,
gave me some dads with some rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Woody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to continue on with this gift
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a coupon in here for 15% off any
purchase at a specific dispensary that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't pay me for an ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another sticker.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a sticker from Gaia's Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, we're moving on up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some cannabis in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two small nugs, probably a good gram of
weed from Mile High Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I approved so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in like a vacuum sealed bag,
so I can't smell it, but it looks quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frosted into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked it last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay smoked some of it last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get high?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually I had that as the first half of
the joint and then I had like the second
[SPEAKER_14]: half of the joint is something else and it
went out after the first half of the joint
[SPEAKER_14]: and I just left it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were just happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know that New York City Diesel is
one of Mike's favorite, or at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way up on my list, any of the New
York diesels.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you guys want to smoke that or
the pre-roll, whichever you feel,
[SPEAKER_01]: there might be a pipe here somewhere that
it might be clean in that little pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make this shit happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then moving on up the ladder,
it's like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gifts just keep getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friends at Incredibles Extracts threw
down a half a gram of Sour Band Zero Nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen, so it's live resin
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like a sappy shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, you guys, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So clear, so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_14]: It tasted so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a half a gram, so it was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's so cheesy, but it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a half a gram, so I basically did
it all in one dab because that's how I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I inhaled and I started to blow it out
and I was like, oh, that tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to like catch my exhale so
that I could exhale real slowly and just
[SPEAKER_01]: savor all of that dab flavor because it
was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Incredibles Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Derek.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great thing to throw in a gift
bag for a VIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my next favorite in here was from
Gaia's Garden, Cannabis Creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a Caramel Apple Double Karma
Edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: This had 200 milligrams of THC and 20
milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this little package, it's one of
these, like the pop top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm trying to pop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these pop top containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two Tootsie Roll size and shape
products and they're wrapped in
[SPEAKER_01]: cellophane.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one was caramel colored and it
was obviously the caramel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a little nibble off the apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like sour apple, Jolly Ranchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I nibbled off the caramel and it
was good, but not my favorite kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: caramel ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit milky maybe might be
the description, but then I pinched a
[SPEAKER_01]: little of both off and threw them both in
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you mix that apple and that
caramel together, oh, it was fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this edible is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 milligrams of THC, 20 milligrams of
CBD in a shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This probably would have been a $20,
$18, $20 edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious and I approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Gaia's Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my favorite thing in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the last thing in the bag and then
we'll move on because I've been going for
[SPEAKER_01]: way longer than I wanted to on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Girl Cannabis Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a six pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all packaged up properly for
Colorado retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that this was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: This actual product was available at a
local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a strain called The Animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 100% sativa and it is a cross of
Jabberwocky and Ghost Train Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a six pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have to grow those in the future
here and see what comes of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody from The Secret
Sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to DJ Juggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody treats me like a VIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've gone to so many sessions that
everybody knows us now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They high five us when they walk in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to The Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should move on from that because we've
been going for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Lindsay and Bobo and Brett
and all the people that just let me come
[SPEAKER_01]: kick it with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got there, the party was already
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I walked in, everyone's like,
scoot over and make room for Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had like, Bobo had a gift for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett had part two of the gift for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, come here and try the
gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a podcast listener
sitting there who I only know you by your
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot think of your real name right
now, but he was sitting there and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, bro, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to shake my hand right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B from Nogoo wanted to run over and
shake my hand right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Margulies wanted to come over and
say what's up and get a hug.
[SPEAKER_14]: So shout out to Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he keeps it moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude's always on the move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a cool brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to really quick.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jason did the funniest thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was telling me how much he loves OGs.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I brought him this huge dab of some OG
18 that I had, and I forgot a carb cab.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had heated the nail and everything for
him.
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_14]: So as he's taking the dab, I'm like,
Jason, I'm horrid.
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot a, I forgot a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was the countertop that was like
granite and he goes underneath it and caps
[SPEAKER_14]: it, like moves himself up and down and
caps it with the corner of like the
[SPEAKER_14]: countertop.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then just exhales and hands back the
rig and he goes, thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, Jason, you're my hero.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to see that the MacGyver spirit
of the community is alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shout out to Jason for just being
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome walking into an event and
being treated like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish somebody would have told the people
at the door who I was, but I wasn't on any
[SPEAKER_01]: list or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt told me, just come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I got there, like,
you're not on any list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I know, go, go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Hunt though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, but for real,
if I tell Hunt, you turned me away,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's going to be fucking pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better go let him know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy came back and he's like,
you're all squirted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Hunt told me personally, show up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to see my text messages?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll even delete his name so it shows up
his number and you can compare it to
[SPEAKER_14]: yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty close to being like,
you just want to read my messages,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, so they let me in, but yeah,
I got in and got to have a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I left that one seat other
than to take a piss once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out for the nachos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting there taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look up and Lindsay's like,
I got nachos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got them vegetarian so you can eat some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to eat all those jalapenos on
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like jalapenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned the gift that Bobo made for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll actually get to the main
topic of this podcast, the new trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been talking about turps here in
Colorado, a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my hand, I've got a half dram vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a small vial, those small vials
with a screw on lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the shorty one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some ghost drain haze, liquid turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Tim from New Mexico,
my friends Tim and Charlie showed up from
[SPEAKER_01]: New Mexico with this device that looked
like a large pipette.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real skinny on one end and it tapers
and gets thicker at the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got like a mouthpiece made onto
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were dunking it into the turps
and then letting the excess drip off back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then without any fire, you keep it
tipped down like you would a straw and you
[SPEAKER_01]: just draw through, they call it a turp
straw, just draw right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull air through it with no heat while
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull air through it and you can taste
the turps incredibly strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to put what I would
normally dunk onto a dab, four people took
[SPEAKER_01]: two good draws off of it before the flavor
went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that I got any head
change because I was already high and we
[SPEAKER_01]: were smoking rosin and stuff, but it's an
incredible way to experience the flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: and the essence of the turps without any
fire or without any waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was talking about this to Bobo,
who is now learning how to blow glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's coming along super fucking quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you could see what he's
doing, I don't want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to spill his beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a project that I think is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this guy is going to kill it,
but he made me a turp straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Bobo for the new sip and
turp straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some red, golden green line work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little Colorado, a Millie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a Millie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an implosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Millie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: He did a little like flower implosion,
but he did it with the Colorado emblem.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making a modification to it because
it's a new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to modify and perfect it for
me, but he's making a little modification
[SPEAKER_01]: that I requested, but shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally appreciate that, but you're
going to see more people taking cold sip
[SPEAKER_01]: turps at events and things in the future
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be something that
we'll catch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I owe a shout out to a glass artist
who's Cameron Reed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to say it slowly, which is
funny because we'll talk about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but shout out to Cameron Reed Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll save that for another episode because
that's going to get long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work on some of the main topics of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's quickly go through the band names.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, they have medical marijuana
available and they've recently banned some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the names.
[SPEAKER_07]: They legalized marijuana for all adults.
[SPEAKER_07]: A year and a half ago, and they're just
now getting through to implementing
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had stores and zoning for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the new regulations is some common
strain names are going away in the state
[SPEAKER_07]: of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a short article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to read all of it because
the second half of the article is not even
[SPEAKER_01]: related to anything involved in what this
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just ramble on about some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from The Oregonian and the
headline says, no more Girl Scout Cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: and other popular names on pot packaging
state says, and this is by Noel Crombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Popular names such as Girl Scout Cookies
and Charlotte's Web won't be allowed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the labeling and packaging of medical and
recreational marijuana in Oregon under
[SPEAKER_01]: rules approved by the state Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission said
it had reviewed about 500 marijuana strain
[SPEAKER_01]: names and identified about 20 that may
appeal to children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commissioners sought the rule change after
hearing from members of the public who
[SPEAKER_01]: objected to the child-friendly names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to interject here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is a kid doing in the
dispensary anyway?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's a kid going to see that on there?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're talking about on the
packaging at home when it's around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucked up that Lindsay is the voice
of reason today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Protect the children is one of the
arguments the anti-pop people have really
[SPEAKER_07]: been able to get legislatures around the
country to listen to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we get to the Colorado rules
in a minute, the reasons they were
[SPEAKER_07]: implemented are essentially identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to keep cannabis products out of
the hands of children.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something that's cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want your kids- Unless it is a
medical condition that they need it for.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just don't want my kid taking my
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say somebody else's,
but I'll put this in on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids should not be using it
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want my child getting access to my
shoe mitt bar and taking this to school
[SPEAKER_01]: and giving it to your kid and your kid
fucking freaking out at school and you
[SPEAKER_01]: suing me and the school getting mad at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kid, that shit doesn't need to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been incredibly rare in college.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you just call me Ricky Bobby?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I said don't put that evil on me,
Ricky Bobby, because you said I'd have a
[SPEAKER_14]: kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get back into this article
before we totally train wreck this bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some strain names being banned
in Oregon now and don't worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: The strains themselves haven't been
banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders have been talking on Facebook
forums and such about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article goes, the rule approved one
day before the state licenses recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana retailers prohibits words that
refer to products that are commonly
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with minors or marketed by
minors.
[SPEAKER_01]: A chairman of the commission called the
new requirement a common sense approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk through a toy store and you
can identify things that are strain names,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are probably inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, it's also as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The agency also won't allow strain names
that refer to illicit drugs such as LSD
[SPEAKER_01]: and blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: LSD is just lemon sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just way easier to fucking write and
blow is a stupid fucking name for a strain
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll get to that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: A list of outlawed proper names,
Girl Scout Cookies, Grape Ape,
[SPEAKER_01]: Candy Land, Charlotte's Web, Cinderella,
Dr. Who, Bubblicious, Smurf, Bruce Banner,
[SPEAKER_01]: Death Star, Skywalker, and Jedi Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those strains will still be allowed in
Oregon's recreational shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retailers and marijuana producers and
processors can use initials or some other
[SPEAKER_01]: shorthand reference instead of the full
strain name.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't have to get renamed or
anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't as bad as I thought.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, but it's pretty gentle,
but it's also pretty silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is kind of silly that you can't have a
Skywalker or Jedi Kush.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know how they're doing it
in Oregon, but in Colorado, it's block
[SPEAKER_07]: printed in black lettering.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how the strain name gets printed on
pretty much every product that leaves a
[SPEAKER_07]: legal dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's never down the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Toys R Us logo is different
colors.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's a really cute font for kids eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just computer printed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on a packaging label with a
shitload of other information on it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me be the voice of reason again.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are still able to legally buy weed in
the shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: So is it that big of a deal?
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget how short of a time you've been
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to get used to it so you can start
bitching about all the practical things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen, I completely understand where you
guys are coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're a hundred percent right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just feel like in the mirror,
in excuse me, in the marijuana industry
[SPEAKER_14]: and community, we have such bigger battles
to be fighting than the fact that we can't
[SPEAKER_14]: use the name girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not being mean.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying like, to me, it just feels
like we can all buy legal weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I get it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a bummer and it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um, at the end of the day,
it's not like you have to rename the
[SPEAKER_14]: strain to be, you know, something
completely ridiculous that that's nothing
[SPEAKER_14]: to do with cookies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they're not saying you can't use any
cookie name or any, they took like 20
[SPEAKER_14]: names out of 500, which in the grand
scheme of things is probably so minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think bounty killer would make this
list?
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the bounty killer not allowed?
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like a lot of Colorado strains
would be pulled on that list.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking about the different ones
we've cared or I've had on a shelf in
[SPEAKER_07]: front of me while I've been working in the
legal industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think about maybe 20% of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oddly enough, green crack is not on
this list.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I read the list, I was like,
well, there's a bunch missing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if this is the criteria.
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe they just got the super blatant
ones and they left the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl scout cookies make sense.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was that, when you said that,
I was like, oh, that makes absolute sense.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is children.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a children organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape ape, candy land, Charlotte's web.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all children's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlotte's web is a kid's book.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a company that's spent a fortune
in like half a decade marketing
[SPEAKER_07]: Charlotte's web around the country.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Cinderella.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to call that GSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also says derivative strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use platinum girl scouts or thin
mints either.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also then you probably can't use
do-si-dos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do-si-dos are banned.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw something the other day that was
snickerdoodle was the strain name.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fruit names.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how many different ones vaguely
meet like an item a kid might have for
[SPEAKER_07]: dessert also.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sour lemon sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctor Who is taken because it's a
fictional character currently marketed to
[SPEAKER_01]: children.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically any fictional character.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was, when I first read this,
I was like, well, some jackass made an
[SPEAKER_07]: Obama Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is that gone too?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because kids know the president.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I mean, how far are they going with
this particular?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I have an issue with it
because as a regulation, it's a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bizarre.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can ban cartoons from the name or
from the logo.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do a lot of other things to make
sure that the products don't target
[SPEAKER_07]: children.
[SPEAKER_07]: But banning stuff that's going to be like
just words in black print.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some of it makes a little bit of
sense, but some of it's, it's just going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be a regulatory pain in the ass down
the road for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just more hoops to jump through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, just more bitching and complaining
for them to do about campus.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of it's subjective.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what makes it a regulatory
issue in my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll get to some Colorado rules here
in just a second that it's not subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's, let's jump right to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that's a good, good segue,
Mike, since we're like 27 minutes in,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's get to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: About halfway through the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect time to move on to my,
my favorite topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado recently, until a few days ago,
until the first, I was allowed to walk
[SPEAKER_01]: into a dispensary, a medical dispensary or
recreational dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to buy without any special
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to the best of my knowledge,
I was allowed to buy two ounces of
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could buy two ounces of shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay says yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_07]: In a medical shop?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a rec shop, just the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a medical shop, I could get my two
ounces because I'm a medical patient and a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was allowed to buy one ounce of
concentrate, which is, is enough
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's not a lot of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're me, I mean, that there
was a fucking two pounds of fucking rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: on this table just a couple of days ago,
but an ounce or two is a substantial
[SPEAKER_01]: amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the new rule is no matter who you
are, no matter where you're shopping,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight gram limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original rule was just basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_14]: On the medical side too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that's on the medical side
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, then the article that I read has
misled me and I'm glad you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: corrected me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Recreational for a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only buy eight grams of
concentrate now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are other rules for edibles and
other items that are sold by the
[SPEAKER_07]: milligram, like edibles and vape pen
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I'm not mistaken, I'm doing this for
memory.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody else has their phone out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheater.
[SPEAKER_07]: No fact check for the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fact checking like a motherfucker
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep talking, go slow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Edible and vape pen limit is now 800
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be 2,800.
[SPEAKER_07]: And concentrate limits are now,
was it seven or eight?
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight grams of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that edible limit changed on the
medical side as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I know, these are just
recreational rules.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the only thing that changed on the
medical side was compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some edible compliance labeling rules,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And imprinting on bars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were two different rule changes
in Colorado, or three different rule
[SPEAKER_07]: changes in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: One limits what people can buy.
[SPEAKER_07]: One limits the shape of certain gummies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of edibles in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or edibles period.
[SPEAKER_07]: But mostly affecting gummies right now
market wide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the last rule is edibles in
Colorado now, the actual item has to carry
[SPEAKER_07]: a stamp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually took notes today.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Denver Post had an interview with
Larry Wolk, the head of the Department of
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado Health and Environment,
the CDPHG, and somebody from the top of
[SPEAKER_07]: the MED, the Marijuana Enforcement
Division.
[SPEAKER_07]: The edible symbols, there's two
exceptions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like every piece of chocolate has to
carry a little, if it's recreational,
[SPEAKER_07]: a yellow diamond with the letters THC
exclamation point in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the medical just has the M,
right, for medical?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's the same diamond.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't have to be a color though.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has to say THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they might've dropped the color.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one of the original things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people were like, well, how do we make
it yellow on a brownie without frosting or
[SPEAKER_07]: some such?
[SPEAKER_07]: It took a while for some companies to get
this implemented.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen one company that they just made
a disc out of sugar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a hundred percent edible,
but it has the logo on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they've affixed it to the top of
their product with like melted
[SPEAKER_07]: marshmallow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is weird in practice, but it's pretty
tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only exceptions to carrying that
symbol are liquids.
[SPEAKER_07]: The liquids manufacturers managed to get
the legislature to see reason and make a
[SPEAKER_07]: specific exception for liquids so that you
can't stamp a liquid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were literally for a while
talking about making it having gold-style
[SPEAKER_07]: schlager floaties that said THC in it or
some such, or only doing singles serving
[SPEAKER_07]: packages of liquids.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could only come in a 10 milligram
serving recreationally, which would pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: much kill recreational liquids.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they carved out an exception.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can still be a hundred milligram liquid
container as long as the measuring device
[SPEAKER_07]: is part of that container.
[SPEAKER_07]: And stuff like granola now has to come in
single serving packages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything like any edible that can't carry
the stamp has to come in individual
[SPEAKER_07]: serving size packages with the label
affixed to that packaging so that you
[SPEAKER_07]: can't leave it on a table and somebody
come along and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is a felony in its own right before
we came up with the label.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still a felony with the label.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like leaving a loaded gun on a table.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wildly inappropriate adult behavior.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's the basic edible rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find- I had to go through three
articles to actually find the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana will remain unchanged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only one article said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first article that I was reading was
actually sponsored by a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were trying to leave medical
marijuana out on purpose, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the way that it was worded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally made it look like it was
happening all over the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that the medical market remains
unchanged.
[SPEAKER_07]: The industry's been talking about this for
a year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay's been over there committing
felonies for the past four days.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even, it's only the second.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was definitely just me this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was the only one committing felonies,
friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are sweating this because
so far in Colorado, not a single licensed
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary has screwed up the purchase
limit rule.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's been cited or fined for selling
over the limit yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's only been a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, we've always had purchase
limits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the limit of anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Period in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: No shop has been cited for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those little random points of
pride.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a while, our teen ID checks stings.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were at 99%, which is unheard of in
liquor or tobacco.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were real proud of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we had one bad round and got
knocked down to 92, just like alcohol and
[SPEAKER_07]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't even check alcohol and
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do, but it's not nearly what they do
with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were doing, it was a real ID and the
person in the ID was wearing a hat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the person checking the ID was
supposed to catch that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the last ID sting that I heard
about performed on a marijuana store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shady.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just trying to fuck with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's checking compliance to the
nth degree.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marijuana shops also face 10 times the
fine that a tobacco or alcohol retailer
[SPEAKER_07]: would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you sell cigarettes or alcohol,
to somebody underage is the possible fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: With marijuana, it's a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could ruin a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could just close you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how big your dispensary is,
a hundred thousand dollar fine could kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's why you gotta be
careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now- Well, that's one of the reasons it
never happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational shoppers can now only buy
eight grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that people that come to
do, that means the ounce deals are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go away at the rec shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more cheap ounce deals because you
can't buy an ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still buy 28 grams of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just talking about, yeah, cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, you'd see concentrate
deals for like four, 20, $500.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a cheap ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and there's no and either.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you can't get your limit in flour
and your limit in hash and your limit in
[SPEAKER_07]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a chart that's been going
around that shows how the breakdown is how
[SPEAKER_01]: many grams of hash equals how many grams
of flour, how many grams of milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles equal how many grams of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't pay attention to the chart because
I'm not working at a bud tender station.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was this great like three month
period where bud tenders didn't have to do
[SPEAKER_07]: pointless math in their head all day long,
like counting to seven over and over in
[SPEAKER_07]: different fractions, depending on what the
order was or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: We was just, 28 was the limit and it was
real simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now there's this that they,
or we all have to keep in our head that
[SPEAKER_07]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just more regulation to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's just going to make
people go to more stores?
[SPEAKER_07]: People that are smurfing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this rule really isn't for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There hasn't been a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they just recently upped the
out of state purchase limit to an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: When this rule was originally passed,
they were talking about out of status can
[SPEAKER_07]: only buy one and a half grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I laughed the first time I read it
because I looked down at my case and I was
[SPEAKER_07]: like, everything comes in one gram
containers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to buy half a gram?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you can buy one gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or well, we've got to talk to all our
distributors and see if they can do a
[SPEAKER_07]: havesy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they hammered it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just recently, a couple of months
ago, they upped that limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think they're worried about
smurfing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just, somebody in the legislature was
like, wait, we let people buy 28 grams of
[SPEAKER_07]: hash or 280, what was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: 2,800 grams of edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 28 of the, or 280 of the most
potent edibles sold in a rec shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a shit ton of edibles.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people leave the spot with
fucking bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to, every now and again,
I'd say, I'll go get you a box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it happens throughout the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And security would follow them to the car
and make sure they got to their car safely
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had that much product on
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it happens from time to time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now with these new limits,
it's just anybody that's looking to do
[SPEAKER_07]: that is just going to have to make more
stops, but it's a weird set of rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can tell it's not the same group
of people writing all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask you a completely random question
that's off topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have both been bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have plenty of experience behind the
bud counter and ringing people up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the largest ticket you have ever
rung up a single person for?
[SPEAKER_07]: My largest personal ticket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 1,700.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, at a rec shop?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lins, do you remember?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it beat Mike's 1,700?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure it does because I
mean, it's a medical shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I know the purchaser?
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got different rules than I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just work at like basically a store in
the mall are the rules I follow other than
[SPEAKER_07]: the ID checks.
[SPEAKER_07]: She works in a medical shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many stupid rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to write down a number.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to write it down and we're
going to gasp.
[SPEAKER_07]: She just kept typing zeros.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got me beat by an order of magnitude
folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's five digits you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_07]: You kicked the shit out of my order.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that came with like a hell of a
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to ask if anybody tipped
you or took care of you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's shaking her head no and putting the
lid back on her bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The giant tickets don't often tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those frugal people is how they have all
that extra money because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking tip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Molly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where was Molly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Molly was not at the secret session.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see Molly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just realized that Molly didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Molly was at a concert or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope Molly had fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was hiking somewhere because I saw
some Instagram pictures.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was up on top of some crazy big rock
all by herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday Molly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're late but happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, did you get to cover all of your
edible stuff that you wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I hit all the new rule changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We covered the purchase limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We covered that the shapes are changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can no longer do human shapes,
animal shapes, fruit shapes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything that resembles a candy that's on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or anything that's identical to its
non-medicated market counterpart.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of your gummies are now squares,
which works out well because it's really
[SPEAKER_07]: easy to imprint the new symbol into a
square.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they handling the sodas?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still do 100-milligram beverages
in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_07]: The container has to carry the new label
and the dosing instrument.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has to come with like a Nyquil
medicine top so that you can dose out your
[SPEAKER_07]: 10-milligram dose and do weed shots with
your friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the tagline when I was selling
those all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever drank like the Cannon Punch
or the Keef Cola?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like you get high more
quickly?
[SPEAKER_07]: The liquid's definitely kicking quicker.
It's sublingual.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's sublingual.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a nice sublingual and your stomach
doesn't have to break down the brownie.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just absorbable quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you drink it and then you go to
do whatever you're doing and then you turn
[SPEAKER_01]: your head to one way to look at something
and you go, oh, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_07]: With Cannon Punch, check the label.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a range of THC in the Cannon
Punches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drink a 200 and I drink it in about one
day of chug.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check the back of the label.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be like 230.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 milligrams ain't going to make a
difference to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in the rec market, there's like a
10, 15, 20-milligram swing that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: see on the back of this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it might be higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, as soon as we get done here,
I'm going to go eat another 100
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some medical hash on the table and
I was really pumped to see that it had lab
[SPEAKER_07]: testing for potency on the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: The medical's coming along with that and I
love to see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally random interjection there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty soon everything will be lab tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a customer appreciation day at the
shop and I chugged a Keef Cola
[SPEAKER_14]: 100-milligram orange soda before it,
not thinking like anything of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like 45 minutes into being there and
I'm like, what the fuck is the matter with
[SPEAKER_14]: me?
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I remembered a conversation I had had
with Buzz E a couple of days before that
[SPEAKER_14]: about how drinks are sublingual and they
hit you harder.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, wow, you're an idiot,
Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just chugged that thing right before
you came in.
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't taste that hashy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just like, go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a bunch of 10-milligram samples at
one point and I took the four flavor
[SPEAKER_07]: samples we got home and without thinking
about it, drank off four of them and
[SPEAKER_07]: jotted down a little flavor review about
each one and just ruined myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like being edible ruined to an extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about 250 milligrams right now is
just about perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go too much far past there
because that's when I started getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: little goofy, started getting a little
hazy, but I'm back on the edible horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I see you, I will not,
it probably not be a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be an edible whore.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take any edibles you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't say he was going to be,
or he was back to being an edible whore.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, I'm back on the edible whore,
which is way fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag on the edible whore.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hashtag who are you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Hashtag can I get on it too?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag troll the host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag I need a carb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my edibles are working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the dads are all working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop a dab, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instant karma.
[SPEAKER_14]: And take hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little warm, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to feel it in your chesty
chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I just turn off your mic?
[SPEAKER_14]: Should I just turn off your mic?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, right now, tell us your,
tell us how to find you on social media,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Add NemoPunk15 on Twitter or Pueblo for
Sensible Cannabis on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was glorious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was glorious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I wrote this episode,
when I wrote the notes, I really thought
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody was limited to eight grams
of purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really changed the impact of my
attitude and of this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned that that was only a
recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so fired up about it now.
[SPEAKER_11]: This round of rules was pretty rational.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rationable, rational and reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say rational?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag rational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coughing at long syllable words are hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we're making up our own words
here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody call Webster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your own podcast, set up some
microphones, get a feed and you can make
[SPEAKER_01]: up your own words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say them into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be some sort of rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say a word more than six or seven
or 12 times, and it's got to be a word
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got to work that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: When people will attend vape competitions,
I can say rational.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to leave the vape kids alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have enough trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, my friend, how can people find
you on social media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear about all 37 of your accounts.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that you say hello out loud.
[SPEAKER_07]: She says it out loud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not even really laughing.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, she's not laughing out loud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like it is when you read it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm the traveling stoner on Instagram and
Periscope and I am the travel stoner on
[SPEAKER_14]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully the next time I'm on here,
I'm in the midst of constructing my
[SPEAKER_14]: website.
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully the next time that I'm on
here, I'll be able to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to troll your website and
share it with everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't troll my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know I will.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thank you both for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I hope to get you on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, we may have you here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me a question and it
directly says, I hope you and Mike can
[SPEAKER_01]: answer this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike, I hope you're here for that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good listeners.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm always happy to come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: More feedback, the better.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know what to dig up and what's part of
our ridiculous amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge to throw at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got questions that you would
like me to answer or Mike or even Lindsay,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can send me questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you'd like to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk about it here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we don't happen to know a good answer
to your question, we'll find the person in
[SPEAKER_07]: the community who does and drag them onto
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you are like my volleyball partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You set them up and I will spike them,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of not knowing the answers to
some things, people have asked me to do an
[SPEAKER_01]: episode about LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally have never grown with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know shit about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two friends that claim they're
going to drive from Denver and do an LED
[SPEAKER_01]: episode with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one of them will show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know him personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other guy, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if I can get him to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives about 130 miles from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's willing to drive to the podcast,
I'd love to get him on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'll get both those cats on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a quick episode about LED
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm trying to get in touch with the
guys that makes the 315s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I commented on one of his Facebook
posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure it's the right dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get in touch with the dude
that makes the 315s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LEC is the light emitting ceramics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get that guy on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about those in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have asked for an episode about
cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so much stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly am not qualified to do an
episode about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pregnancy, I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are two things that I feel like
I should be at least one of to do an
[SPEAKER_01]: episode about pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are either a doctor or a woman or a
woman doctor, or if you've got experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis and pregnancy and you know
more than I do and you're more comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: with the subject, I'd love to get you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could talk all about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I could throw in on that
topic is the relevant laws you might be
[SPEAKER_07]: breaking and the repercussions you might
face legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how that system works in places like
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll know I used to read this all the
time in patients charts when I worked with
[SPEAKER_07]: locked up teens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's something that's going to follow
your kid around for that life.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the hospital chooses to drug test you
or your baby during the delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got dreadlocks or if you
look like me, your kid's going to get drug
[SPEAKER_01]: tested as soon as it comes out.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the most part, the system works.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just if anybody involved in the
birthing process, like that whole hospital
[SPEAKER_07]: stay, decides to, yeah, let's drug test
that mom and that baby, then it happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just if anybody happens to make
that decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: The local anti-pot group down here,
they're working with one of the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got one month worth of data.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, half the babies we
tested came back positive for THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the end of their statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you dig a little deeper, 10 babies were
tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: During that period, five of them came back
positive for THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't tell you what was up with the
other five.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's part of the national legalization
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it could be a cool episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could find the right people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have, that's not my wheelhouse,
I guess, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally just had to look up all of
these laws because like I worked in the
[SPEAKER_07]: legal industry and had a kid while I did
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of you have been budtenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I don't know if we should,
you're no longer a budtender.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a budtender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay is a budtender.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do if a pregnant customer
comes in and tries to buy cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's perfectly legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: To purchase it because you... What
happened with us is the, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_07]: are we going to do this for the show?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just something you brought up
randomly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of a sudden this is like a two
hour show now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if I'm a man and I try to buy
weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you treated me like you're the
customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's awkward.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was in front of me in the dispensary the
other day was pregnant and they served her
[SPEAKER_14]: no issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: When my wife was pregnant, she stopped at
the gas station a couple of times and
[SPEAKER_07]: bought me cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like the second time she did,
she was like, I ain't fucking doing that
[SPEAKER_07]: again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I just wasn't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just something she's done for
forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I looked up and I was like,
what?
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I said, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, people judge you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that probably looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a whole bunch of stuff that your
doctor tells you you shouldn't consume or
[SPEAKER_07]: do while you're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not all because like heroin and coke
and shit around that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like 99% of it's legal and it's just
not advised.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you are, if you're an expert,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even have more education on it than I
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're more comfortable talking about
it than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's more of a woman's topic
and I should have a woman involved in this
[SPEAKER_01]: to help me through this so that I don't
