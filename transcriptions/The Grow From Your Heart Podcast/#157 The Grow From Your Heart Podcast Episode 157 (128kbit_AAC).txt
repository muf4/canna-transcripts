[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's usually white, Mike, but today he's
kind of red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike took a dab, got for about 15,
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still got half a cough cooking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel free to cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: The coughs make you feel like people are
there with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it fly, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it fly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the table, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this podcast, we are going to talk
about some new purchase limits here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been restricted on how much hash we
can purchase here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they've changed some rules on some
edibles and also in Oregon, they have
[SPEAKER_04]: banned some popular strain names.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, let's talk a little bit about the
secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the secret sesh on Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay was also there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had much more important things to
handle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm finally not working for a secret sesh
and it's the wife's birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday to the wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: A secret sesh happens every month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wife's birthday is only once a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, once a month, thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a good night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, happy birthday to the wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's late, but still better late
than never.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay and I and a whole bunch of other
people had the pleasure of attending the
[SPEAKER_04]: secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you think about the sesh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun at this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of squatted up a little bit on
some couches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Invaded some space, claimed some
territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took over some tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There weren't enough tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a bunch of people brought super fancy
glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dino, what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dino Joe P collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ty had his elbow Joe Peters collab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super snazzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Max had his Matt Robinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a collab?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea who made it, but it was
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the shape of it is Matt Robinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to re-look that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a green giraffe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you Brett and Chris are both
listening to this episode screaming,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a collab with so and so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, whoever made it, both of those
pieces were fancy fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these dudes pull out these fancy rigs
and there's no table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was like a heady zoo and there's
nowhere for the zoo to like, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had some staff find some table space
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made a little bit of table space
through some hats.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got down pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Ty for that huge ass dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can catch that on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was... That's the first time I got to
hang out with Ty.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude's a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Ty is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Earl Tycoon on Instagram
and THC chocolates, which is his edible
[SPEAKER_00]: company as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: He threw me some stickers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got those stickers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go on something cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably a case of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some of his edibles at the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles, edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of edibles, that's a good
segue.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when you do that for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the secret sesh, our good friend Max
sat down next to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying not to say good friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember a long time ago I was going to
put saying good friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friend Max from TNC Extractions sat
down next to me at the secret sesh and he
[SPEAKER_04]: knows I don't eat bacon and he's felt bad
for offering me medicated bacon at all the
[SPEAKER_04]: past sessions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he pulls out a banana pudding bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hundred milligrams of THC and he
hands this to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, here, bro, you want this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't eaten edibles in, uh,
it's been four or five months since I had
[SPEAKER_04]: eaten edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I broke that, uh, banana pudding bar
in half and I ate half of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did a little selfie video with Ms. Lindsey
here and I passed the other half of it to
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she split it with Bobo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am back on the edibles wagon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I eat edibles again at the secret sesh,
which was Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate the, uh, banana pudding bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate a couple of little smaller edibles
that people gave me like candies and such,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a caramel or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then I ate something else that
we're going to talk about later on in the
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Saturday I ate a 100 milligram
cloddy bear, a cherry one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, not to diss any cloddy bears,
but the cherry are absolutely not my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like the cherry one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a little bit of a mediciney funky
aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cherry that a lot of the candy
companies use has that medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't prefer, uh, I liked the root beer
is fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got an apple one that's really
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the ones that they have like a
raspberry that they actually dip in
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, the cherry didn't, it got me high
as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I slept like a baby, but I did not like
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't buy that one again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, then today I ate, uh, from Gaia's
garden edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate a 100 milligram milk chocolate
cherry truffle, which was quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to go slow to try to say what
that was because it, because it is
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously working on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a delicious edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm back in the edibles game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I gotta go slowly because I catch
myself just becoming way over medicated on
[SPEAKER_04]: the edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do that to myself again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get all fucking ruined and
slow on edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So secret session was a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to everybody that hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett, um, Max and Ty for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Them three, um, and, uh, twisty as well as
where I was headed.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, Dwayne Dwayne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the dude whose name I did not know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a nice little crew there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uncle Stoner hung out with us a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude in the vest that was filming
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's uncle Stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's kind of well known.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his own show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check him out if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there were a lot of cool people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam Mill came and hung out with our
little squad and took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam Mill holds it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a really cool host.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he's the kind of host that'll,
there was a band playing and as the band
[SPEAKER_04]: played, he just came and kicked it with
us, rolled the backwood, hung out with us,
[SPEAKER_04]: took some dabs with the crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, flirted with a couple of chicks and
then skedaddled right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunt throws a hell of a party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this time at Secret Session,
I did something that I don't usually do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was given the VIP gift bag.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Hunt for giving us both
one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just real quickly go through the
gift bag and talk about what's in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start with the things that
are least impressive to the most
[SPEAKER_04]: impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a company called Healing Nations LLC,
uh, Cultivation Consulting Cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: Systems and Nutrients threw in a small
baggie of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's a little bit of buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's, um, it's okay weed and it's not
impressive weed, but it was a gift.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to smoke this here later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but yeah, they threw in some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also next up, The Lazy Lion threw in a
real big flyer in a small baggie and they
[SPEAKER_04]: threw down a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys want to smoke a pre-rolled
joint, that's probably a gram and a half,
[SPEAKER_04]: two grams of weed in that joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could smoke that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I owe somebody a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, totally random off the cuff here,
but somebody gave me an 18 gram joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was given an 18 gram joint that's rolled
and ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supposed to smoke it at the Secret
Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I was having a Scattery Dan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not take it to the Secret Sesh with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Charlie Torres, uh,
and his son.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also big shout out to Tim and
everybody involved in Organica down in New
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys grew some Arise and it tested
at 30.8%.
[SPEAKER_04]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's Golden Goat Cross to the
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave them some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grew the shit out of my stuff down
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I've got two strains that have been
lab tested by Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've tested over 30% THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two different labs, same company,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and maybe, yeah, two different labs,
one in Colorado, one in New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_04]: same company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the, uh, link to that is both strains
are Golden Goat Crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemon Jeffrey is the Lemon Skunk Cross to
a Golden Goat Cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a Lemon Goat, Reversed Male.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a Feminized Seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one hit 31%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the, uh, the, uh, the Arise is the
fucking, uh, Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold, I'm fucking full of shit right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to edit part of this
because I'm saying this all wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Lemon Skunk is a Lemon, yeah,
the Lemon Jeffrey is a Lemon Skunk to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Goat and the Arise is Golden Goat
to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a basically the non-feminized
version of the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those have both, they've got the
Golden Goat parent in there and those have
[SPEAKER_04]: both tested over 30%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to my friends down there in
New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Charlie Torres, an
organically grown, hand trimmed,
[SPEAKER_04]: perfectly cured, perfectly rolled 18 gram
joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to get everybody high as shit
wherever we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said they smoked one the other night
at another event and it went around for
[SPEAKER_04]: over an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get lit wherever we go
when we smoke that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't smoked it yet, but it,
it's, you can probably see it from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on that table.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that fucking baseball bat sitting
over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that thing, I can't wait to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: They passed through here the other day,
gave me some dads with some rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, shout out to Woody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate all you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to continue on with this gift
bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a coupon in here for 15% off any
purchase at a specific dispensary that
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't pay me for an ad.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a, another sticker.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a sticker from Gaia's Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see, we're moving on up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there is some, some cannabis in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, uh, two small nugs, probably a good
gram of weed from Mile High Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it looks, it looks like I approved so
far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in like a vacuum sealed bag,
so I can't smell it, but it looks quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoked it last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay smoked some of it last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, actually I had that as the first half
of the joint and then I had like the
[SPEAKER_00]: second half of the joint is something else
and it went out after the first half of
[SPEAKER_00]: the joint and I, uh, just left it that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were just happy with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know that, uh, New York City
Diesel is one of Mike's favorite,
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way up on my list, any of the New
York diesels.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you guys want to smoke that or
the pre-roll, uh, whichever you feel,
[SPEAKER_04]: there might be a pipe here somewhere that
it might be cleaning that little pipe
[SPEAKER_04]: cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make this shit happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then moving on up the ladder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The gifts just keep getting better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friends at Incredibles Extracts threw
down a half a gram of Sour Band Zero Nine
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's live resin concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of like a sappy shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry you guys, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clear, so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so cheesy, but it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I basically did it all in one dab
because that's how I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I inhaled and I started to blow it out
and I was like, Oh, that tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to like catch my exhale so
that I could exhale real slowly and just
[SPEAKER_04]: savor all of that dab flavor because it
was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to Incredibles Extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, shout out to Derek.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great thing to throw in a gift
bag for a VIP.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, then one of my next favorite in here
was from Gaia's Garden, uh, Cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: Creations.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a Caramel Apple Double Karma
Edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: This had 200 milligrams of THC and 20
milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this little package, it's one of
these, uh, like the pop top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm trying to pop it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these pop top containers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were two Tootsie Roll size and shape
products and they're wrapped in
[SPEAKER_04]: cellophane.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was green.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one was caramel colored and it
was obviously the caramel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a little nibble off the apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like sour apple, Jolly Ranchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I nibbled off the caramel and it
was good, but not my favorite kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: caramel ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit milky maybe might be
the description, but then I pinched a
[SPEAKER_04]: little of both off and threw them both in
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you mix that apple and that
caramel together, Oh, it was fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this edible is really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, 200 milligrams of THC, 20 milligrams
of CBD in a shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: This probably would have been a $20,
$18, $20 edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it was delicious and I approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to Gaia's Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, then my favorite thing in the bag,
this is the last thing in the bag and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll move on because I've been going for
way longer than I wanted to on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I was surprised to see this Dutch Girl
Cannabis Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a six pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this is all packaged up properly for
Colorado retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I heard that this was available.
[SPEAKER_04]: This actual product was available at a
local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this is a strain called the Animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hundred percent sativa and it is a
cross of Jabberwocky and Ghost Train Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got a six pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have to grow those in the future
here and see what comes of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to everybody from the Secret
Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to DJ Juggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody treats me like, like a VIP.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we've gone to so many sessions that
everybody knows us now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They see us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They high five us when they walk in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know who we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know who they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should move on from that because we've
been going for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, shout out to fucking Lindsay and Bobo
and Brett and all the people that just let
[SPEAKER_04]: me come kick it with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got there, the party was already
started.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I walked in, everyone's like scoot
over and make room for Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody had like, uh, Bobo had a gift
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brett had part two of the gift for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, come here and try the
gift.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a podcast listener
sitting there who I only know you by your
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot think of your real name right
now, but he was sitting there and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, bro, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wanted to shake my hand right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B from no goo wanted to run over
and shake my hand right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason Margulies wanted to come over and
say what's up and get a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jason, big shout out to Jason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He keeps it moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude's always on the move.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a cool brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason did the funniest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, he was telling me how much he loves
OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I brought him this huge dab of,
um, some OG 18 that I had and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I forgot a carb cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, I had heated the nail and
everything for him and I forgot a carb
[SPEAKER_00]: cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as he's taking the dab, I'm like,
Jason, I'm horrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot a, I forgot a carb cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the countertop that was like
granite and he goes underneath it and caps
[SPEAKER_00]: it like moves himself up and down and caps
it with the corner of like the countertop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just exhale and hands back the
rig and he goes, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Jason, you're my hero.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to see that the MacGyver spirit
of the community is alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Jason for just being
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome walking into an event and
being treated like a rockstar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish somebody would have told the people
at the door who I was, but I wasn't on any
[SPEAKER_04]: list or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunt told me, just come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I got there, like you're not
on any list.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I know, go, go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Hunt though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, but for real,
you, if you, if I tell Hunt, you turn me
[SPEAKER_04]: away, he's going to be fucking pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You better go let him know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy came back and he's like,
you're all square to go, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, dude, like I'm not
trying to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Hunt told me personally show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll even delete his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows up his number and you can
compare it to yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty close to being like,
you just want to read my messages,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, so they let me in, but yeah,
I got in and got to have a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I left that one seat other
than to take a piss once or twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out for the nachos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting there taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look up and Lindsey's Lindsey's
like, I got nachos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got them vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can eat some.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, damn, I'm going to eat all
those jalapenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't like jalapenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you- Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mentioned the gift that Bobo made for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll actually get to the main
topic of this podcast, the new trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been talking about turps here in
Colorado, a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my hand, I've got a half dram vial.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a small vial, those small vials
with a screw on lid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the shorty one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's some ghost drain haze, liquid turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend Tim, from New Mexico,
my friends, Tim and Charlie, showed up
[SPEAKER_04]: from New Mexico with this device that
looked like a large pipette.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's real skinny on one end and it tapers
and gets thicker at the other end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got like a mouthpiece made onto
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were dunking it into the turps
and then letting the excess drip off back
[SPEAKER_04]: into the container.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then without any fire, you keep it
tipped down like you would a straw and you
[SPEAKER_04]: just draw through.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it a turp straw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just draw right through it with no heat
while it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pull air through it and you can taste
the turps incredibly strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were able to put what I would
normally dunk onto a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four people took two good draws off of it
before the flavor went away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know that I got any head
change because I was already high and we
[SPEAKER_04]: were smoking rosin and stuff, but it's an
incredible way to experience the flavor
[SPEAKER_04]: and the essence of the turps without any
fire or without any waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was talking about this to Bobo,
who is now learning how to blow a glass,
[SPEAKER_04]: who's coming along super fucking quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you could see what he's
doing, I don't want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to spill his beans.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a project that I think is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the new shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this guy is going to kill it,
but he made me a turp straw.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to Bobo for the new sip and
turp straw.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got some red, golden green line work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a little Colorado Milly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a Milly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an implosion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a million.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a little like flower implosion,
but he did it with the Colorado emblem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's making a modification to it because
it's a new product.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to modify and perfect it for
me, but he's making a little modification
[SPEAKER_04]: that I requested, but shut out for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally appreciate that, but you're
going to see more people taking cold sip
[SPEAKER_04]: turps at events and things in the future
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be something that
we'll catch on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I owe a shout out to a glass artist
who's Cameron Reed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hard to remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had to say it slowly, which is
funny because we'll talk about this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but shout out to Cameron Reed Glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll save that for another episode because
that's going to get long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's work on some of the main topics of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's quickly go through the band names.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Oregon, they have medical marijuana
available and they have recently banned
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the names.
[SPEAKER_05]: They legalized marijuana for all adults.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, a year and a half ago?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just now getting through to
implementing regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had stores and zoning for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the new regulations is some common
strain names are going away in the state
[SPEAKER_05]: of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a short article.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to read all of it because
the second half of the article is not even
[SPEAKER_04]: related to anything involved in what this
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just ramble on about some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: This comes from The Oregonian and the
headline says, no more Girl Scout Cookies
[SPEAKER_04]: and other popular names on pot packaging
state says, and this is by Noel Crombie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Popular names such as Girl Scout Cookies
and Charlotte's Web won't be allowed on
[SPEAKER_04]: the labeling and packaging of medical and
recreational marijuana in Oregon under
[SPEAKER_04]: rules approved by the state Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission said
it had reviewed about 500 marijuana strain
[SPEAKER_04]: names and identified about 20 that may
appeal to children.
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners sought the rule change after
hearing from members of the public who
[SPEAKER_04]: objected to the child friendly names.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to interject here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fuck is a kid doing in the dispensary
anyway?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's a kid going to see that on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're talking about on the
packaging at home when it's around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the arguments.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucked up that Lindsay is the voice
of reason today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Children's one of the arguments.
[SPEAKER_05]: The anti pop people have really been able
to get legislatures around the country to
[SPEAKER_05]: listen to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we get to the Colorado rules
in a minute, the reasons they were
[SPEAKER_05]: implemented are essentially identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to keep cannabis products out of
the hands of children.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want your kids unless it is a
medical condition that they need it for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just don't want my kid taking my
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put this in on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want my child getting access to my
shoe mitt bar and taking this to school
[SPEAKER_04]: and giving it to your kid and your kid
fucking freaking out at school and you
[SPEAKER_04]: suing me and the school getting mad at me,
my kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been incredibly rare in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get back into this article
before we totally train wreck this bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some strain names being banned
in Oregon now and don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: The strains themselves haven't been
banned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been some breeders have been
talking on Facebook forums and such about
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article goes the rule approved one day
before the state licenses recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana retailers prohibits words that
refer to products that are commonly
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with minors or marketed by
minors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chairman of the commission called the new
requirement a common sense approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you walk through a toy store and you
can identify things that are strain names,
[SPEAKER_04]: those are probably inappropriate,
he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The agency also won't allow strain names
that refer to illicit drugs such as LSD
[SPEAKER_04]: and blow.
[SPEAKER_04]: LSD is just lemon sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just way easier to fucking write and
blow is a stupid fucking name for a strain
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: No more green crack either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that list.
[SPEAKER_04]: A list of outlawed proper names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Girl Scout cookies, Grape Ape,
Candyland, Charlotte's Web, Cinderella,
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctor Who, Bubblicious, Smurf,
Bruce Banner, Death Star, Skywalker and
[SPEAKER_04]: Jedi Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those strains will still be allowed in
Oregon's recreational shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Retailers and marijuana producers and
processors can use initials or some other
[SPEAKER_04]: shorthand reference instead of the full
strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have to get renamed or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't as bad as I thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's pretty gentle, but it's also
pretty silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is kind of silly that you can't have a
Skywalker or Jedi Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know how they're doing it
in Oregon, but in Colorado, it's block
[SPEAKER_05]: printed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And black lettering.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how the strain name gets printed on
pretty much every product that leaves a
[SPEAKER_05]: legal dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's never down the front like the
Toys R Us logo is different colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a really cute font for kids eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just computer printed on a packaging
label with a shitload of other information
[SPEAKER_05]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me be the voice of reason again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still able to legally buy weed in
the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget how long or how short of a time
you've been here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to get used to it so you can start
bitching about all the practical things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely understand where you guys are
coming from, though, because you're 100
[SPEAKER_05]: percent right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like in the in the in excuse
me, in the marijuana industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: community, we have such bigger battles to
be fighting than the fact that we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use the name Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not being mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying, like, to me, it just
feels like we can all buy legal weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I guess at it, it's a bummer and it's
a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's not like
you have to rename the strain to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something completely ridiculous
that that's nothing to do with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they're not saying you can't use any
cookie name or any.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took like 20 names out of 500,
which in the grand scheme of things is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably so many.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Bounty Killer would make this
list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the bounty killer not allowed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of like Colorado strains
would be pulled on that list.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about the different ones
we've care or I've had on a shelf in front
[SPEAKER_05]: of me while I've been working in the legal
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think about maybe 20 percent of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And oddly enough, Green Crack is not on
this list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I read the list, I was like,
well, there's a bunch missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if this is the criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they just got the super blatant
ones and they left the others.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was that when you said that,
I was like, oh, that makes absolute sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is children.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a children organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grapeape Candyland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all children's stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlotte's Web is a kid's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grapeape is a kid's character.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a company that's spent a fortune
in like half a decade marketing
[SPEAKER_05]: Charlotte's Web around the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Cinderella.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to call that GSC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also says derivative strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't use Platinum Girl Scouts or Thin
Mints either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So also, then you probably can't use Dosey
Dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dosey Dose are banned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw something the other day that was
Snickerdoodle was the strain name of the
[SPEAKER_05]: fruit names.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how many different ones vaguely
meet like an item a kid might have for
[SPEAKER_05]: dessert also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour Lemon Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctor Who is taken because it's a
fictional character currently marketed to
[SPEAKER_04]: children.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically any fictional character.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was when I first read this,
I was like, well, some jackass made an
[SPEAKER_05]: Obamacush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, is that gone, too, because kids know
the president?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, how far are they going with
this particular?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I have an issue with it,
because as a regulation, it's a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bizarre.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can ban cartoons from the name or
from the logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do a lot of other things to make
sure that the products don't target
[SPEAKER_05]: children.
[SPEAKER_05]: But banning stuff that's going to be like
just words and blocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like some of it makes a little bit of
sense, but some of it's it's just going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a regulatory pain in the ass down the
road for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just more hoops to jump through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just just more bitching and complaining
for them to do about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of it's subjective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what makes it a regulatory
issue in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll get to some Colorado rules here
in just a second that it's not subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's let's jump right to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that's a good good segue,
Mike, since we're like twenty seven
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to this about halfway through
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a perfect time to move on to my
favorite topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado recently, until a few days ago,
until the first, I was allowed to walk
[SPEAKER_04]: into a dispensary, a medical dispensary or
recreational dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was able to buy without any special
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think to the best of my knowledge,
I was allowed to buy two ounces of
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I could buy two ounces of shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay says yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: In a medical shop, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a rec shop, just the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so in a medical shop, I could get my
two ounces because I'm a medical patient
[SPEAKER_04]: and a recreational shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was allowed to buy one ounce of
concentrate, which is is enough
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's not a lot of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're me, I mean that there
was a fucking two pounds of fucking rosin
[SPEAKER_04]: on this table just a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But an ounce or two is a substantial
amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now the new rule is no matter who you
are, no matter where you're shopping,
[SPEAKER_04]: eight gram limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The original rule was just I don't think
so on the medical side, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that's on the medical
side, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, then the article that I read has
misled me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad you guys have corrected me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recreational for 100 percent sure you can
only buy eight grams of concentrate now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are other rules for edibles and
other items that are sold by the
[SPEAKER_05]: milligram, like edibles and vape pen
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm not mistaken, I'm doing this for
memory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody else is a fun cheater.
[SPEAKER_05]: No fact check for the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fact checking like a motherfucker right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You keep talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edible and vape pen limit is now 800
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be twenty eight hundred.
[SPEAKER_05]: And concentrate limits are now was seven
or eight.
Eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight grams of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that edible limit changed on the
medical side as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I know, these are just
recreational rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only thing that changed on the
medical side was compliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some edible compliance labeling rules.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and imprinting on bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were two different rule changes
in Colorado or three different rule
[SPEAKER_05]: changes in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: One limits what people can buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: One limits the shape of certain gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of edibles in or edibles period.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but mostly affecting gummies right now
market wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last rule is edibles in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the actual item has to carry a stamp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually took notes today.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Denver Post had an interview with
Larry Wolk, the head of the Department of
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado Health and Environment,
the CDPHG and somebody from the top of the
[SPEAKER_05]: MED, the Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_05]: The edible symbols there's two exceptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like every piece of chocolate has to
carry a little, if it's recreational,
[SPEAKER_05]: a yellow diamond with the letters THC
exclamation point in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the medical just has the M right for
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the same diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a color,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to say THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they might have dropped the color.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the original things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people were like, well, how do we make
it yellow on a brownie without frosting or
[SPEAKER_05]: some such?
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: For some companies to get this
implemented.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen one company that they just made
a disc out of sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's 100 percent edible, but it has the
logo on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they've fixed it to the top of
their product with like melted
[SPEAKER_05]: marshmallow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is weird in practice, but it's pretty
tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only exceptions to carrying that
symbol are liquids.
[SPEAKER_05]: The liquids manufacturers managed to get
the legislature to see reason and make a
[SPEAKER_05]: specific exception for liquids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, you know, you you can't stamp a
liquid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were literally for a while
talking about making it having gold style
[SPEAKER_05]: schlager floaties that said THC in it or
some such or only doing single serving
[SPEAKER_05]: packages of liquids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could only come in a 10 milligram
serving recreationally, which would pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much kill recreational liquids.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they carved out an exception.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can still be a 100 milligram liquid
container.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as the measuring device is part of
that container and stuff like granola now
[SPEAKER_05]: has to come in single serving packages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything like any edible that can't carry
the stamp has to come in individually,
[SPEAKER_05]: individual serving size packages with the
label affixed to that packaging so that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can't leave it on a table and somebody
come along and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a felony in its own right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we came up with the label.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a felony with the label.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like leaving a loaded gun on a table
like it's it's wildly inappropriate adult
[SPEAKER_05]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the basic edible rundown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you find?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article I had to go through three
articles to actually find the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical marijuana will remain unchanged.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one article said that the first
article that I was reading was actually
[SPEAKER_04]: sponsored by a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were trying to leave medical
marijuana out on purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think because of the way that it was
worded, it totally made it look like it
[SPEAKER_04]: was happening all over the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that the medical market rec
limits have changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry has been talking about this
for a year now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay's been over there committing
felonies for the past four days and not
[SPEAKER_05]: knowing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but I was definitely just me this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was the only one committing felonies,
friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are sweating this because
so far in Colorado, not a single licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary has screwed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The purchase limit rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's been cited or fined for selling
over the limit yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's only been a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, we've always had purchase over
the limit of any period in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: No shop has been cited for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's sort of it's one of those
little random points of pride for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our team, our teen ID check stings.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were at ninety nine percent,
which is unheard of in liquor or tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were real proud of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had one bad round and got
knocked down to ninety two just like
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't even check alcohol and
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not nearly what they do with with
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were doing it was a real ID.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the person in the ID was wearing a
hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the person checking the ID was
supposed to catch that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last ID sting that I heard
about performed on a marijuana store.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sketchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's shady.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just trying to fuck with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's checking compliance to the
nth degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marijuana shops also face 10 times the
fine that a tobacco or alcohol retailer
[SPEAKER_05]: would.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you sell cigarettes or alcohol to
somebody underage is the possible fine
[SPEAKER_05]: with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could ruin a business.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could just close you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter how big your dispensary is,
a hundred thousand dollar fine could kill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess that's why you gotta be
careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that's why one of the reasons it
never happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recreational shoppers can now only buy
eight grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean that people that come to do
that means the ounce deals are going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: away at the rec shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: No more cheap ounce deals because you
can't buy an ounce of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still buy 28 grams of flour.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just talking about cheap because I
mean you'd see concentrate deals for like
[SPEAKER_04]: four, 20, 500 for a cheap ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and there's no and either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can't get your your limit in
flour and your limit in hash and your
[SPEAKER_05]: limit in edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a chart that's been going
around that shows how the breakdown is how
[SPEAKER_04]: many grams of hash equals how many grams
of flour, how many grams of milligrams of
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles equal how many grams of flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't pay attention to the charts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not working at a bud tender station.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was this great like three month
period where bud tenders didn't have to do
[SPEAKER_05]: pointless math in their head all day long,
like counting to seven over and over in
[SPEAKER_05]: different fractions, depending on what the
order was or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We was just 28 was the limit and it was
real simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now there's this that we all have to
keep in our head.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just more regulation to follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's just going to make
people go to more stores?
[SPEAKER_05]: People that are smurfing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this rule really isn't for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There hasn't been a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they just recently upped the
out of state purchase limit to an ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: When this rule was originally passed,
they were talking about out of status can
[SPEAKER_05]: only buy one and a half grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I laughed the first time I read it
because I looked down at my case and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, everything comes in one gram
containers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you going to buy that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy one gram or well, we've got to
talk to all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our distributors and see if they can do a
havesy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they hammered it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just recently, a couple of months
ago, they upped that limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think they're worried about
smurfing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just somebody in the legislature was
like, wait, we let people buy 28 grams of
[SPEAKER_05]: hash or two hundred and eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Twenty eight hundred grams of edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's twenty eight of the two hundred and
eighty of the most potent edible sold in a
[SPEAKER_05]: wreck shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a shit ton of edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people leave the spot with
fucking bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have every now and again,
I'd say, I'll go get you a box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it happens throughout the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Security would follow them to the car and
make sure they got to their car safely
[SPEAKER_04]: because they had that much product on
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it happens from time to time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with these new limits,
it's just anybody that's looking to do
[SPEAKER_05]: that is just going to have to make more
stops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a weird set of rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can tell it's not the same group
of people writing all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask you a completely random question
that's off topic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are both been bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have plenty of experience behind the
bud counter and ringing people up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the largest ticket you have ever
rung up a single person for?
[SPEAKER_05]: My largest personal ticket?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like seventeen hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: At a wreck shop?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lins, do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to say it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it beat Mike seventeen hundred?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty sure it does because I
mean, it's a medical shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy so much more.
[SPEAKER_04]: The limits are totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I know the purchaser?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can not.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got different rules than I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just work it like basically a snore in
the mall are the rules I follow other than
[SPEAKER_05]: the ID checks.
[SPEAKER_05]: She works in a medical shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many stupid rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to write down a number.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to write it down and we're
going to gasp.
[SPEAKER_05]: She just kept typing zeros.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got me beat by an order of
magnitude, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's five digits, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kicked the shit out of my order.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that came with like a hell of a
prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to ask if anybody tipped
you or took care of you for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's shaking her head.
[SPEAKER_04]: The giant tickets don't often tip.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those frugal people is how they have all
that extra money because they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking tip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tip your butt tender.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Molly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was Molly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Molly was not at the secret session.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't see Molly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just realized that Molly didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly was at a concert or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Molly had fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was hiking somewhere because I saw
some Instagram pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was up on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: She went for a big birthday hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you, girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Molly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're late, but happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, did you get to cover all of your
edible stuff that you wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I hit all the new rule changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We covered the purchase limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We covered that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds under the impression that shapes
are changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can no longer do human shapes,
animal shapes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fruit shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that resembles a candy that's on
the shelf.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or anything that's identical to its
non-medicated market counterpart.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of your gummies are now squares,
which works out well because it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: easy to imprint the new symbol into a
square.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they handling the sodas?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can still do 100 milligram beverages
in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_05]: The container has to carry the new label
and the dosing instrument.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has to come with a Nyquil medicine
top so that you can dose out your 10
[SPEAKER_05]: milligram dose and do weed shots with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the tagline when I was selling
those all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever drank the Canapunch or the
Keef Cola?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like you get high more
quickly?
[SPEAKER_05]: The liquid's definitely kicking quicker.
It's sublingual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's because it's sublingual.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a nice sublingual and your stomach
doesn't have to break down the brownie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just absorbable quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you drink it and then you go to
do whatever you're doing and then you turn
[SPEAKER_04]: your head to one way to look at something
and you go, oh, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_05]: With Canapunch, check the label.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a range of THC in the Canapunches.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drink a 200 and I drink it in about one
big chug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check the back of the label.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be like 230.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 milligrams ain't going to make a
difference to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in the rec market, there's like a
10, 15, 20 milligrams swing that you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see on the back of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it might be higher than medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, as soon as we get done here,
I'm going to go eat another 100
[SPEAKER_04]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some medical hash on the table and
I was really pumped to see that it had lab
[SPEAKER_05]: testing for potency on the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical's coming along with that and I
love to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally random interjection there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty soon everything will be lab tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a customer appreciation day at the
shop and I chugged a Keef Cola,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 milligram orange soda before it,
not thinking like anything of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like 45 minutes into being and I'm
like, what the fuck is the matter with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I remembered a conversation I had
had with Buzzy a couple of days before
[SPEAKER_00]: that about how like drinks are sublingual
and they like hit you harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, you're an idiot,
Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just chugged that thing right before
you came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even like it didn't taste that hashy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just like, good, good,
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a bunch of 10 milligram samples at
one point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I took the four flavor samples we got
home and without thinking about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: drank all four of them and like jotted
down a little flavor review about each one
[SPEAKER_05]: and just ruined myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like being edible ruined to an extent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you pass me the torch?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about 250 milligrams right now is
just about perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to go too much far past there
because that's when I started getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: little goofy, started getting a little
hazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm back on the edible horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I see you, I will not probably not
be in the secret section.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you said whore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whichever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be an edible whore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take any edibles you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't say he was going to be or he was
back to being an edible whore.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, I'm back on the edible whore,
which is way fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're doing that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag on the edible whore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag, who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag, can I get on it too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag troll the host.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag, I need a carb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my edibles are working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the dad's are all working.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop a dab, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instant karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a little warm, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to feel it in your chesty
chest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag glowy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I just turn off your mic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I just turn off your mic?
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, tell us your, tell us how to
find you on social media, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: At Nemopunk15 on Twitter or Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was glorious.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was glorious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I wrote this episode,
when I wrote the notes, I really thought
[SPEAKER_04]: that everybody was limited to eight grams
of purchasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really changed the impact of my
attitude and of this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I learned that that was only a
recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not so fired up about it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This round of rules was pretty rational
and reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say rational?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag rational.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coughing at long syllable words are hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, we're making up our own words
here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody call Webster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your own podcast, set up some
microphones, get a feed, and you can make
[SPEAKER_04]: up your own words.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just say them into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be some sort of rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say a word more than six or seven
or 12 times, and it's got to be a word
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just got to work that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people will attend vape competitions,
I can say rational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to leave the vape kids alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have enough trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, my friend, how can people find
you on social media?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear about all 37 of your accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: LOL stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, let me see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that you say LOL in person.
[SPEAKER_05]: She says it out loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not even really laughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she's not laughing out loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like it is when you read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the traveling stoner on Instagram
and Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am the travel stoner on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, hopefully the next time I'm on
here, I'm in the midst of constructing my
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully the next time that I'm on
here, I'll be able to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to troll your website and
share it with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't troll my website.
[SPEAKER_04]: You already know I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, thank you both for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, I hope to get you on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, we may have you here too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody asked me a question and it
directly says, I hope you and Mike can
[SPEAKER_04]: answer this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mike, I hope you're here for that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always happy to come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: More feedback, the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what to dig up and what's part of
our ridiculous amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge to throw at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got questions that you would
like me to answer, or Mike or even
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, you can send me questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know what you'd like to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will talk about it here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't happen to know a good answer
to your question, we'll find the person in
[SPEAKER_05]: the community who does and drag them onto
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you are like my volleyball partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: You set them up and I will spike them,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of not knowing the answers to
some things, people have asked me to do an
[SPEAKER_04]: episode about LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally have never grown with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know shit about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two friends that claim they're
going to drive from Denver and do an LED
[SPEAKER_04]: episode with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one of them will show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know him personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other guy I don't know, so I don't
know if I can get him to drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lives about 130 miles from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he's willing to drive to the podcast,
I'd love to get him on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I'll get both those cats on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a quick episode about LED
lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'm trying to get in touch with the
guy that makes the 315s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I commented on one of his Facebook
posts.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did not reply.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even sure it's the right dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to get in touch with the dude
that makes the 315s.
[SPEAKER_04]: The LEC is the light emitting ceramics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get that guy on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about those in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have asked for an episode about
cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is so much stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly am not qualified to do an
episode about cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are two things that I feel like
I should be at least one of to do an
[SPEAKER_04]: episode about pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are either a doctor or a woman or a
woman doctor, or if you've got experience
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabis and pregnancy and you know
more than I do and you're more comfortable
[SPEAKER_04]: with the subject, I'd love to get you on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could talk all about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I could throw in on that
topic is the relevant laws you might be
[SPEAKER_05]: breaking and the repercussions you might
face legally and how that system works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works in places like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to read this all the time in
patients' charts when I worked with locked
[SPEAKER_05]: up teens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something that's going to follow
your kid around for that life.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the hospital chooses to drug test you
or your baby during the delivery.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've got dreadlocks or if you
look like me, your kid's going to get drug
[SPEAKER_04]: tested as soon as it comes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the most part, the system works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just if anybody involved in the
birthing process like that whole hospital
[SPEAKER_05]: stay decides to, yeah, let's drug test
that mom and that baby, then it happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just if anybody happens to make
that decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: The local anti-pot group down here,
they're working with one of the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've got one month worth of data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, half the babies we
tested came back positive for THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the end of their statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you dig a little deeper, 10 babies were
tested during that period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five of them came back positive for THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't tell you what was up with the
other five.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's part of the national legalization
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a cool episode if we could
find the right people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my wheelhouse, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally just had to look up all of
these laws because I worked in the legal
[SPEAKER_05]: industry and had a kid while I did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of you have been budtenders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, I don't know if we should start.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're no longer a budtender.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were a budtender.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay is a budtender.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: If a pregnant customer comes in and tries
to buy cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's perfectly legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: To purchase it because you... What
happened with us is that... Are we going
[SPEAKER_05]: to do this for the show?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just something you brought up
randomly and all of a sudden this is like
[SPEAKER_05]: a two-hour show now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens if I'm pregnant and I try to
buy weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you sell me weed until you have a great
day?
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl in front of me in the dispensary
the other day was pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they served her no issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: When my wife was pregnant, she stopped at
the gas station a couple of times and
[SPEAKER_05]: bought me cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second time she did, she was like,
I ain't fucking doing that again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wasn't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just something she's done for
forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked up and I was like,
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I said, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, people judge you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that probably looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole bunch of stuff that your
doctor tells you you shouldn't consume or
[SPEAKER_05]: do while you're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause like heroin and coke and shit are on
that list too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like 99% of it's legal and it's just
not advised.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're an expert, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even have more education on it than I
do and you're more comfortable talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about it than I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's more of a woman's topic
and I should have a woman involved in this
[SPEAKER_04]: to help me through this so that I don't
sound like a sexist dude that's
[SPEAKER_04]: uneducated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get a doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a lady to come help me out with this
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to do this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten probably more than three
emails on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably three to five emails are
questions about cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd love to get some help on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I think that's all that we have
got for you in this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank my friends again for
coming and hanging out with me.
