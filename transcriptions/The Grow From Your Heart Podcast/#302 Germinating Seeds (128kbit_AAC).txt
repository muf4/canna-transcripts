[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 302 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you noticed a difference in the
intro music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have permission from my friends in
the Mystic Roots band to use their track.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when I put these videos up on
YouTube, YouTube flags every video that
[SPEAKER_00]: has got a Mystic Roots track in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an effort to prevent myself from
pissing off YouTube, I am using my own
[SPEAKER_00]: original music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get permission from Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've given me permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got emails about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coots, my friend, we talk regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, YouTube doesn't know that,
and YouTube doesn't know that we've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we can figure out how to get
management to clear that with YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will simply be using my own music.
[SPEAKER_00]: The track you just heard was my own Rasta
Jeff reggae creation using Garage Band,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some music that you can give
me permission to use on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love some fresh new intro music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to feature your tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 302, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am smoking on some Tahoe OG,
and it is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cracking open the jar to give it a little
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells exactly like what Tahoe OG is
supposed to smell like, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some OG Kush to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little funky feel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of gasoline in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a hint of gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't overpower you with gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more of that OG Kush,
lower, earthy, coffee, sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how ice cream, coffee ice
cream, smells like coffee but not
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely strong, but when you get close
to it, you can smell that coffee aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the coffee, the soft coffee
aroma that comes with this Tahoe OG
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just smelled the microphone thinking
that that would help me smell the batter a
[SPEAKER_00]: little louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a nice golden buttery texture
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a very nice indica dominant
high to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke this, my life slows down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head gets a little heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes get droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arms feel like they weigh a little more
than they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Apothecary for
the great Tahoe OG extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me lit up, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm smoking on the Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also earlier, I took some dabs of some
Pure Love Shatter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred the Pure Love, so it was great to
walk in and see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pure Love is Zac Case to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend, Zac Case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you and love you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: We honor you every day by smoking strains
named after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got 202 videos to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you hear this, there will be
202, possibly 203 YouTube videos up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am caught up for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not completely caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my intention, my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to do, iTunes and Stitcher
will hold 100 episodes of my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at episode 302.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I've got the 100 most recent in
iTunes and then I get everything else up
[SPEAKER_00]: into YouTube and stay caught up right
there, I feel like I'm mostly caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I will have every single episode
up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 302 will be there when I'm at 302.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably gonna take to about 350 or
400, honestly, to catch up with myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making equipment upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing things that will speed up my
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time to be productive,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making YouTube videos is very time
consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making the video doesn't take that long,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting the video to post to YouTube
that takes forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I complain about it constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A one hour YouTube video will take three
to four hours to post to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's happening, I cannot use my
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer is basically stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a slave to YouTube at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't do anything, but we'll get caught
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly caught up for what I feel like
I wanna do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep you guys updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out YouTube and search for the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast and check out
[SPEAKER_00]: the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, I put out episode 300 and
you guys loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of the response on episode
300.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so many emails, so many tweets,
so many messages, so many high fives from
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends that I didn't even know
listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, dude, that episode 300 was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got super lit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out for like four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recorded most of it, but I only put out
about two hours because there was a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just us going, dude, I'm high,
duh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't nothing to say,
nothing going on, just a bunch of dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting here being stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming and hanging out at the
Dab Table with Kevin and Mike and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great time recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure knowing that you guys have
fun just hanging out with Mike and Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: and I when we're just being stoned and
doing our normal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to my friend, Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned Bo Nellis from the SPLIF
Podcast in the episode and she was
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the show and she actually
said that she was typing me a tweet when
[SPEAKER_00]: she got a shout out on the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Bo, thanks for the tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to getting your podcast
back on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to hearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We miss you, Bo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss your presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss having my kindergarten teacher
teaching me about cannabis and opening my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes to cannabis in new ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you, Bo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm kind of rambling,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Tahoe OG and the Dr. Pepper
have got me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two emails that kind of line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a couple of quick details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to read the other email and
I will give a lot of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to email me,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get your email read on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out the Patreon
campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this guy say if I can use his name or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you could probably see right through
the paper if you watch the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, hey, Ross DeGeoff,
I have a terrible dilemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fairly new grower, only with two
grows officially under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who uses Sativa dominant
strains to medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are my favorite to enjoy also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after helping him in a pinch after my
last harvest, he asked if I could grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: his medicinal needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like this dude ran out of
some herb and you gave him some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you grew and he was impressed
and now he's asking you to grow for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to get your foot in
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to become a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a great way to feel some pride
knowing that you're doing things right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I agreed of course,
but now I am having a problem with getting
[SPEAKER_00]: my seedlings going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've burned through 10 seedlings of iry
genetic seeds and three Doc Johnson's this
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started from seed before and I've
never had this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built an enclosed three by two by one by
half of a foot enclosure to start my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: before moving them into a four by four
tent with LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running an LED grow, a LED grow light
from a big box store paired with some CFLs
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enclosure is lined with reflective
material, humidity around 40% and temp
[SPEAKER_00]: from 65 to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small computer fans for fresh air and
exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't figure out why they are damping
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even had tomatoes and peppers in there
and they all did the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice is greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again and stay iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signed it with his name,
which I'm not sure if he wants read on the
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, PSI hit up your Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for all that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things that got my
attention here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great email, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good content.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives me a great platform to get on a
rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've built a three by two by one by half
foot enclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to envision that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three foot tall, two foot by one foot by
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I get it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start your seeds, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before moving them into the four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of details that you
left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they dying before they make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make it to the four by four or are
they at least getting that far?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they're even making it out
of your enclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying that you're burning off
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're killing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're drying up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend more humidity in that
small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get that humidity at least up
around 50%, maybe 60 or 75% if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little seeds want some moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting too dry in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would get it a little warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it 65 to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold and dry come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets cold, your skin gets dry,
shit gets dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting it too cold and they're
drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simply what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more heat and more water and that
will create humidity and that's gonna help
[SPEAKER_00]: you out overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just turn off those small computer
fans for fresh air and exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've created a wind
tunnel and so you've got a seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting right here and say the microphone
is the seedling and this is your fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just blowing on them all day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drying them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dirt's getting dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your seedlings are getting dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got too much airflow probably in
that little tiny space and not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add some humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would increase the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a couple things that you
left out that I'm not sure how to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know what medium you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using peat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using a soilless mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of medium they're
getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how far you've gotten them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you're sprouting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only help you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how often and how much are you
watering these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you soaking the shit out of them and
letting them go from really wet to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dry or are you just barely keeping them
wet by watering them really frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're doing so I'm not
sure what your method is so I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: how to tell you to adjust other than they
need more water, they need more moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: they need more humidity and they need more
heat and it would probably help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know what you're doing and I
will follow up with you when I get your
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up email.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far it just sounds like that small
space is getting, it's too cold which
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like it would keep the moisture in
there but think about when it's cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: your lips get chapped, refrigeration
creates dryness so you're kind of making
[SPEAKER_00]: it too cold in there to keep your moisture
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now I'm gonna read this next
email and it kind of coincides with this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, thanks for the
show and all the cannabis knowledge you
[SPEAKER_00]: throw out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined in on one of your Instagram live
feeds tonight and I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the story about the guy you
met at a show and traded the grateful dog
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that story will come up on a
future episode also by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on, he says, but I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about popping seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard many different techniques that
just get more and more complicated like
[SPEAKER_00]: soaking the seeds in water, then dipping
them in mycos once they crack,
[SPEAKER_00]: then putting them in a damp paper towel
till the tap roots pop out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: finally planting the seeds in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with the good old finger in
the soil and drop the seed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the benefits from soaking a seed or
doing the paper towel technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my real name from Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Aaron, thanks for the great email dude
and also thanks for giving me permission
[SPEAKER_00]: to use your name because it cuts out a lot
of do I do this or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to give people shout outs and I
like to share people's names if they want
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you listen, but Joey Diaz
said my name on the podcast a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and it made me fucking giddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that I make people a little
bit giddy inside when I say their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want your name said,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into these questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great questions on this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good stuff to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one he says, what's wrong with the
good old finger in the soil and drop the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is wrong with that technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the technique that I used to use
until I became impatient and employed my
[SPEAKER_00]: new technique just for to be a little more
careful, to be a little more, to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more attention, have a little more
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how most people used to do
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what's wrong with that technique
is seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis seeds have become ridiculously
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're paying more than $10 per
seed, you want to do everything you can to
[SPEAKER_00]: get every seed to count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're just putting them straight
into the dirt, there's a lot of chaos that
[SPEAKER_00]: can go on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not on top of things,
you can kill those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just sprouting any other seed,
they're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're less than a dollar per seed,
most vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis has gotten ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're five to 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen $20 seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 10 packs of seeds going for 250
bucks of certain strains right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds, cannabis seeds are ridiculously
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with the old finger in the
soil and drop the seed in technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing if you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this guy is talking about,
I would get a solo cup with decent soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like, I hate saying brands,
but something like Fox Farms, the Light
[SPEAKER_00]: Warrior or the Ocean Forest would work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something fluffy like that with perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: A decent starting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your beer cup up if you're gonna use
like a solo cup or a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your beer cup up most of the way with
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poke some holes in it in the bottom so you
have drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then before you put the seedling in there,
water that pot, water that cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: water that dirt, saturate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take your fingertip, and I've got big
fingers, so I would go about halfway to my
[SPEAKER_00]: first knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say for most people, if you're a
normal size person, go almost to the first
[SPEAKER_00]: knuckle deep in that soil and just poke a
little hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doink, just put your finger in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only need to go, I'm trying to find
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something to measure the depth of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using lined paper, the length
between the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depth of the width of a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however your finger, your finger,
the width of it, go that deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's too many fucking words to
describe what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just barely poke it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need that seed to go under the
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So poke it and then set the seed there and
then just push a little dirt right over it
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of tap it so that it's
secure and then just leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it under a light and that seedling
will grow up toward the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the taproot will grow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what seeds want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to grow up toward the light and
the taproot wants to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put it in there and you take
good care of it, that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to keep it at the proper
moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep the room not too windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep things right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said earlier, with the price of
these seeds, that's kind of risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't have all day to babysit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't risk them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when we start employing these
other techniques that get more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said like soaking the seed in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only do that with old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my seeds are fresh and fairly new and
from a reliable breeder and I've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: them recently, I do not do the soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seeds are kind of old, I will give
them a soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some old seeds and you want
to germinate them, I would start by
[SPEAKER_00]: soaking them in water for 12 to 18,
maybe 24 hours at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go more than 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting gooey and you'll
drown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only with old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you've got seeds that are not old,
that are, if you just got some iri genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from the Helidank seed bank and
you're trying to get those started,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get a plate and I'd get a paper
towel and I'd pour water all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel and fold that into quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would tip the plate and let all the
excess water run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let that water run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the paper towel saturated towards
filled with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just put your seeds right inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got it folded into fours already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the size of your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the seeds right in the middle and fold
it one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put that inside of a Ziploc
baggie and set it on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the baggie on the plate on top of the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the refrigerator is gonna get a
little bit warm up top, but the plate is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna give you a little bit of a buffer
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water inside the baggie is going to
be trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to create humidity inside of
that baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got enough water in there to
activate those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna stay alive in there because
you've got all the air trapped in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not gonna dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't take too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 24, 36, maybe 48 hours in that baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got germinated cracked seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how long your taproot is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that root get too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: An inch or so is long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's getting dangerously long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it starts getting that long,
it's gonna start getting real leggy and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna start growing funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that sprouted taproot and this
is where you get the beer cup that we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beer cup with holes in the bottom
that's filled with soil that is already
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you want the soil already wet
before you put the seed in there so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you put the seed in there and you
backfill it, you don't disturb it by
[SPEAKER_00]: watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have it wet first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet the medium first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poke your finger in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna go just a little bit deeper than
you would have with a fresh seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your sprouted seedling,
just go a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just maybe your first knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then set that seedling in there real
carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't disrupt that taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the taproot pointing down and the
seed pointing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brush a little dirt over it and let it
chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've either soaked them and got them
started for 24 hours to soften them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put them in the paper towel and
you're checking them every six hours-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna check them at 12, 18,
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get them into dirt as soon as they're
starting to sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your seeds have successfully made it
to the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less risk when you've got them in
that paper towel in the baggie because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't dry out and drying out seems to
be what's killing everybody's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I do not like a heat mat for the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said put them on top of the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very little heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them up on top of the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plate and then they're in the
baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very little heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those heat mats, you guys, get out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard to regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys buy those seed sprouting mats at
the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're unreliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fucking like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just gonna cook your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think you're gonna cook your clones
with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also said putting mycos or something
in them once they crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find that necessary unless you've
got old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good young seeds have enough energy to get
themselves started.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got enough energy to start their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their whole purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they start sprouting, their first set
of true leaves is when I actually start
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them any nutrients at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to go for five, maybe seven or 10
days before getting fed anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard so many techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get more and more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak them in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only do that with old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dipping them in mycos once they crack,
that's kind of some OCD stuff and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary, but if you want to go overboard
and do a lot of things to your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in a damp paper towel until the
taproot pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them on top of the fridge and put them
in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside that paper towel is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good way to make sure you don't
lose your nutrients and they want to find
[SPEAKER_00]: air and they want to spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So encourage that by having it moist,
but not too wet and also having some air
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of oxygen is good for your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have plenty of humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them too cold because seedlings
don't like cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll really slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll really make them stagnant,
but probably you could kill them with too
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get them too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put fans directly on them,
but have some airflow in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they start perking up, put a fan on
them really lightly because if you don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will start stretching and getting
kind of leggy on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep a T5 light right above my
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of T5 light is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get them going, you can increase
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much light may be slowing you down and
speeding up your dry process and that may
[SPEAKER_00]: kill your plants by damping them off,
which is the problems that people seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be having.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little tip also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got your seedlings in the
medium and they're starting to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's time to water, don't go in there
with your pitcher or your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water in can and just fucking pour water
in that cup because you're gonna disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: that seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is get a spray bottle and I put
my water with a little bit of nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spray bottle and I go ahead and I
spray that dirt and I spray it real
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly until it's saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I'm not going to disrupt my new
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to give it nutrients until
you see the first set of true leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: those little shitty leaves where it
sprouted and spread in half and popped
[SPEAKER_00]: open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tear those little bottom shitty
leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's basically my rant on how
to get some seeds started, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overthink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds in nature were supposed to
fall out of that plant at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season and fall onto the ground and sit
there and get rained on and snowed on and
[SPEAKER_00]: sit there through the winter and then in
the spring when that snow melts and the
[SPEAKER_00]: water gets down into the soil,
that's when it starts activating those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they start popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overthink it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are supposed to be sitting in
dirt outside getting snowed on and when
[SPEAKER_00]: the snow melts, that was what was going to
make them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably making it too complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make seeds happen super simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overthink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be wet, but not drowned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like I've talked enough
about seeds, I want to give a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: shout outs real quick and then we'll get
to another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Jade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a shout out to my friend Tyler,
Maddie E, and Dustin S.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, let's find another quick email
on this pile of emails that I have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signed it Raj and we'll read it like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, I have a male space bomber
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cloned it once to keep it alive through
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clone is an eight inch tall bush with
balls under 18 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it still be viable when I go to
flower in the spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep that plant under 18 hours
of light, that is the way to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in a vegetative state, which will
prevent it from flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's an eight inch tall bush with
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got balls, it is already starting
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably flowering because it is
root bound or because it's not getting fed
[SPEAKER_00]: right or simply because the light cycle is
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're giving it 18 hours of light and
it's flowering, I would recommend giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it 20 or 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's wrong if it's got balls
already and you're giving it 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, you've got a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you plan on breeding, why are you
keeping a male plant alive through the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems weird unless you plan on
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you wouldn't want to flower that
in the spring unless that male plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make pollen, not buds,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a male, I would just get rid of
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an eight inch tall bush with
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problematic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just toss that and get yourself
some fresh seeds, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow it in the spring,
that's now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you are, I would just
get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just order some fresh seeds from the
helidankseedbank at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Raj, if I confused you or if you'd
like to tell me more about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I love to answer all of your
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has it been since you've been on
a vacation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower, I know it's nearly impossible
to take a vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go away for the weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go see fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to sneak away and go have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I'm gone, I'm just
freaking out wondering what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't freak out anymore because my
friends at PL Grow Systems have sent me
[SPEAKER_00]: the most amazing device, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a device called the Minder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the Minder, I hung it in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a few things in the right spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I created an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I logged in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now wherever I am, I can open my phone
and I can go to PL Grow dot systems and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can look at what's going on in my grow
room from anywhere on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I've got a wifi connection and
I've got my phone in my hand, I can see my
[SPEAKER_00]: temps and my humidity in my grow and I can
make sure nothing's going wrong and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: stop freaking out and I can actually enjoy
the fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, I highly
recommend the Minder for my friends at PL
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at PL Grow dot systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out and let them know that
Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I want to thank
everybody again for the great emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a question that you would
like me to answer on a future episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a service that allows you as a
listener to financially contribute to this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to give everybody a big thank
you because I've been working toward a new
[SPEAKER_00]: MacBook and with the help of my Patreon
contributors and a few other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to order the new MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not here yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be here by Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next couple of episodes will be
recorded on the new MacBook if things go
[SPEAKER_00]: my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge deal because the MacBook I'm
currently recording on is kind of taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: poop and it has me worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as much fun recording as it could
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure the new unit is going to make
this a breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the help with the new
MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've almost covered the cost of the
MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did it because it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that the Patreon contributions
will cover are things like the new
[SPEAKER_00]: MacBook, the website, these microphone
covers, the headphones, all these little
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of crap out at random times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Patreon contributions are what I
use to keep the equipment going,
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the website alive and to keep the
computer up and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're listening and you were
unable to contribute to Patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to give me money to hear my

[SPEAKER_00]: I get super stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out and take dabs and I talk with
my friends on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me questions and I will answer
them right there live on the fly with no
[SPEAKER_00]: notes, no research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like quiz the grower and I
kind of enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me on my toes and I actually pull
some material from those feeds to use on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me on the Instagram live videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out, watch me take dabs,
