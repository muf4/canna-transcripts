You
[SPEAKER_04]: gotta turn on the mics, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: That might help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 58.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I hope you guys are as dabbed at as
we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to do the big old long
intro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to give a big shout out to Kat
and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are high as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of we, what's up, Spence?
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, what up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me across the table is my buddy,
Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He showed up with a mothership rig,
an appellate case.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew we were going to get wrecked as
soon as he walked in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do one quick ad and then we're going
to get to this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: The organic portions of this podcast were
brought to you by my good friends at the
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in
Colorado Springs for fresh worm castings,
[SPEAKER_04]: African night crawlers, red wigglers,
and all of your organic soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has
Dragonfly Earth medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get the same worm castings that I
use, the same casting that Spence uses,
[SPEAKER_04]: the same casting that Sean and Jesse use.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get them all through www
.rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you're in Colorado, visit them at
411 Tijuana Street in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the shit, literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned on the music here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's loud in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always, this podcast is brought to you by
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Byrne.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, big shout out to Spence,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming to the growers meeting
the other night.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of got chaotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't much of a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just smoked too much weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all smoked too much weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should get like a board.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to prepare something next time
so that it's not just a bunch of smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a question box.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has to do a question to have.
That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to answer whatever questions
people have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, if you listen to the show and you
come to the growers meetings, all you got
[SPEAKER_04]: to do is email me or tweet me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will base my next lesson for the growers
meeting around some of your questions
[SPEAKER_04]: also.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Hygro Indoor Growing
Supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a Denver location, 6271 Beach
Street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, 618 East 4th Street.
[SPEAKER_04]: In beautiful Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next time you shop at Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies, tell them you listen to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast and you
will get commercial pricing on your entire
[SPEAKER_04]: order.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking super sweet, super fat
deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody wants to save some money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence, you had something to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just tried to take a selfie that said
episode 58 and there's a dab right over my
[SPEAKER_03]: camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all cloudy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is good dab life for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know you're a dabber if your phone is
sticky and has dabs on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to pick up your car keys and
there's half a dab stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a dab in my beard the other morning
when I woke up and I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_04]: hell happened there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But dab life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to give a shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's up with you taking selfies on
the show?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's OG right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG, triple, triple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did quick ads because Spence is here and
we're high and I just want to get to the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ramble about commercials.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't want to hear a lot of
commercials.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you guys are interested in
sponsoring the show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get you all of that info.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Spence texted me the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, let's do a podcast dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I said, what do you want to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, canopy management.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good three minute intro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No rambles, no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So canopy management.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been watching Spence follow a guy
named Greenworks on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of this will be inspired by our
buddy Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I choked when I said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm not glad to say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was odd, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_04]: He kind of inspired Spence to set up some
really killer cage-like, not really cages.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cage is only on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to explain how you did it or
do you want me to keep rambling for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's essentially a single plant scrog
to where you have, we use bigger pods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenworks uses 27s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use this right around 20s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a 20 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them and they look pretty big.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're about 22 inches around,
18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe even more than 18, maybe about 24
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pots are two foot tall, probably easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it works for what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about working the surface area
you're given, especially in areas where
[SPEAKER_03]: they limit plant counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That could do a lot of things for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm writing down the word surface area
because that's a good thing to think
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go back to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, for people with limited plant
counts in Colorado, well, in our location,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're definitely messing with plant
counts and we're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow as many plants as we used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what Spence has done, he's taken these
giant pots and he takes a plant and he
[SPEAKER_04]: built a PVC sort of a frame around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's got a square frame now above the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: How big is that square?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a four by four square cage,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You build a cage out of your PVC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do layers of trellis for support.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the only one that does it,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that are trying it
because it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's more bang for your buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, it's strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still get good yields,
but you'll get better yields out of
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that are built for that system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla Glue loves it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bounty Killer loves it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like those moonshine haze, that haze
plant loves to just grow all inside that
[SPEAKER_03]: net.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's things like that that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cookies, they'll do decent,
but not like a Gorilla Glue would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially it's a four by four cage
with multiple trellises.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you will lollipop from the soil
to the first trellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything from that first trellis up
will be just nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Naked.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got your frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a square.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you put a net over and then you just
got excuse me, guys, I'm choked up from
[SPEAKER_04]: the dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you just got a bud going through each
part of the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put another screen on to support it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if it gets out of control because
it's Gorilla Glue, you got to put another
[SPEAKER_04]: third screen up there if you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, it's more about,
you know, canopy management, like making
[SPEAKER_03]: sure while it's you know, especially
through the stretch phase from day one a
[SPEAKER_03]: flower till day 21, 22 ish when it's
growing like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to get in there and really
like tie them down, make sure they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: growing out of what they need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, you know, with those trellis
nets, I think they're like three by three
[SPEAKER_03]: squares or four by four squares.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you want to try to essentially
get a nug or a cola to hit every single
[SPEAKER_03]: one of those squares.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's I don't know if there's 60
of them on a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just, you know, the surface area works.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how early in the veg do you start
manipulating the screen?
[SPEAKER_03]: So typically what I do is I'll go from a
one gallon pot or a clone to one gallon,
[SPEAKER_03]: one gallon to three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll let that three kind of get bulky
in that three gallon and then straight
[SPEAKER_03]: into the final pots and then give them,
you know, five, six weeks veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not as long as people think it
is, especially when it's strain dependent
[SPEAKER_03]: and strains grow, you know, faster than
other strains.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be worth it in the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get the weight in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you find your strain, that you
want to use, you know, you basically are
[SPEAKER_03]: training it through the nets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's getting too tall, throw another
trellis on it, make it go back under the
[SPEAKER_03]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So just keep bending it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can keep bending it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I like to do is I like to just kind
of on your first screen, you kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: spread it open and then you let all the
insides grow up and everything on the
[SPEAKER_03]: outside is going to grow around in the
cage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all those little shoots that would just
be cut off if you're lollipopping normally
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to grow into actual branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're going to grow straight up
into branches.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the Gorilla Glue, you're going to
get long extended branches out of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have branches from like the bottom
of the stalk that shoot clear up to the
[SPEAKER_03]: top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canopy management.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read an article a long time ago that
kind of introduced me to this idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article was actually called Growing on
the Grid is what I think it was called.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the author was Eric Vixa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to Google that just to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he used to be a writer for High Times
and he wrote an article about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm searching his name while I talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm pretty sure that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure because I want to give
you guys a reference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's called Growing on the Grid with
Eric Vixa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll kind of if you guys want to read
more about it, this is kind of we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to give you the the inaction in practice
sort of talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eric Vixa is he writes a lot, so he's
going to give you a really technical
[SPEAKER_04]: explanation on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm not sure how many times he's
done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence here has done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you messaging Greenworks?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try to get Greenworks to
call in one day and we'll talk to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got I just actually learned how to
record quality phone interviews using
[SPEAKER_04]: FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably can do it with Skype also.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't experimented with that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other night I opened up FaceTime and
played around and I'll be able to record.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys want to be on the show and
you're far away, FaceTime is now the way
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greenworks, I'm inviting you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of FaceTime, I'm going to get I
want to talk about this guy in a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes, but I'll talk more about canopy
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have a phone interview planned with
a guy named Soil Grown from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about his tech here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got this 20 gallon pot full of
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got you said you go from a clone
cup into the one gallon pot into the three
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the three goes into the 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you top before you transplant into the
20 at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really a big topper, depending on
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like for the system, Gorilla Glue,
I don't it's a plant to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people do top it, but I'm more of
just kind of, you know, working it through
[SPEAKER_03]: the net.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll take one branch and take it all
the way to the left side and take this
[SPEAKER_03]: branch and take it to the right side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually in that system,
it's going to fill itself back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't realize it would work that
extremely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I've got like if I took my whole arm
and just bent it over, it's going to just
[SPEAKER_04]: make little shoots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just going to be horizontal
for four feet across the room pretty or
[SPEAKER_04]: two feet from each.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially what you want to do is,
you know, as your, you know, your colas
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, your nodes stack vertically.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow together up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were to bend that branch all the
way down, you'll take in each one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: bud sites, turn them up, which creates
more bud sites on that plant than you
[SPEAKER_03]: would get stacking it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so you're not going to you may not get
as many long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you won't get like giant colas,
but you'll get a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all about the space because we're
not trying to grow concrete underneath the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to grow all of the space for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes pretty good sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't top it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's see, I would have topped them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would have fucked up from
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some strains I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla Glue is one of the ones I it kind
of grows the plants wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll grow with his eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably taunting a lot of people
because a lot of the world can't get their
[SPEAKER_04]: hands on a Gorilla Glue cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's there's, you know,
there's some things I would do early in
[SPEAKER_03]: veg, you know, because you give them a
nice, you know, five, six week veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple, two weeks worth of,
you know, femming and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: training and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, kind of once they
three weeks before flower, you got to let
[SPEAKER_03]: them heal up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least two weeks, three weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit messing with them so that they know
what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they are apical dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to know which way is up still.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to build up some hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have like seven questions in my head
and I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, ask a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not Gorilla Glue, what other
strain do you like to Scrog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know you've got a killer
arsenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you done the White Widow this way?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, this this is my first go at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks impressive for his first go
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm blown away and it's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still learning like the curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still picking up the curve,
which is, you know, going from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, seven and tens up to 20s and two
plants that are two to three times the
[SPEAKER_03]: size, you know, maintenance on those
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you always have to be cleaning up the
bottoms and stuff, because imagine,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a six foot plant that's four and
a half feet wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's no light underneath
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the things like the leaves and stuff
die off just because they don't get light
[SPEAKER_03]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to constantly be in there
picking them off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that you said that would have been
a six foot tall plant and that you've
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten it down to four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of puts it into a lot of
perspective for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like my extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running Gavitas in a nine foot ceiling
room, but it's all about can you keep them
[SPEAKER_03]: down?
[SPEAKER_03]: The light, the Gavitas will work for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all about like, in my opinion,
when you when plants get tall and get
[SPEAKER_03]: close up to the Gavitas, then they kind of
feel how powerful they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you get that canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when you get that canopy management
all the way down, you know, it's all about
[SPEAKER_03]: surface area.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you have a prediction on how much
weight you're going to pull per thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: watt light with this new system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right now, per thousand watt,
I'll probably pull on my first go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably six, seven hundred grams per
Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's over a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pound and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a pound and a half if it comes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll be a pound and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only in a 4K.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running a 4K Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a six week veg, that's not bad at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants really grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you put them from a three gallon
pot into a pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've seen the stalks of your plants
and they're bigger around than these
[SPEAKER_04]: microphone stands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're almost as big as my arms and I'm
not that big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like their wrist size for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your rooms look great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've been in there in a few days or
so, but I've been there recently and they
[SPEAKER_04]: look pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Big Mike, Matty, Michael,
everybody that keeps the gardens on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else helps over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tater comes over.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up cousin Tater?
Phil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we can't forget Phil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get Phil on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil is really the he raps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil raps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we can let him come rap.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can do all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw up a beat and let Phil rap.
[SPEAKER_04]: He raps better than I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil and Slop.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do some raps together.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are invited on the show,
boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to this, Michael,
Big Mike, Slop, Phil, Matty, you guys are
[SPEAKER_04]: always welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you want to do a podcast,
just text me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's podcast time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do a live podcast at the cup?
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't do it like live broadcasting,
but we could record it from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I have a house and all that?
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I talked about taking my recording
equipment to the cup and just taking it to
[SPEAKER_04]: my hotel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just bring it to my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bring it to your house and we could
do it up there and record people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call cool people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guy, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are going to be, this is not
set in stone, but if you guys are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be in the Denver area during the cannabis
cup and you're down with Spence and you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to take a dab with Rasta Jeff and the
Garden of Weed and crew, there's a good
[SPEAKER_04]: chance I will bring some, maybe not this
big old setup, but I might bring some
[SPEAKER_04]: small recording gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want this to disappear while I'm
at the cup or something from the car or
[SPEAKER_04]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my livelihood, so I'd be crushed
without it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this gear, some kind of recording gear
may end up at the... I've got my phone,
[SPEAKER_04]: if nothing else.
[SPEAKER_04]: That works well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a podcast or let's at least hang
out at the cannabis cup, you guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: and take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: This show won't come out for probably a
week from... Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a week from tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they'll have plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the middle of March when this
comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's meet up at the cannabis cup,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have some Jeff's OG dabs if
Spence is down to blast it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let him do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No diggity.
[SPEAKER_04]: No diggity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about canopy management.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we got a lot of that covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not going to do that,
do the Scrogs, you can lollipop really
[SPEAKER_04]: heavily.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another good way to make space for
what you've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of pay attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get down on your knees and see how far the
light is getting into your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you don't see any light hitting
those leaves, just clean that shit off
[SPEAKER_04]: from the bottom there because there's no
light getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a waste of space.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also other ways of canopy
management.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do staking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do lots of staking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Scrog system, but I still like
the old school going in a room and being a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred stakes deep in there and it's
like, oh Lord.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how Dread over at River Rock does
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you walk through there, it's Stake
Central.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys got all the wood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stake City.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got wood for days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like some stakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to grow tall plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use a seven gallon pot and I veg them
until they're about three and a half feet
[SPEAKER_04]: tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they end up six feet tall by the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: That requires either a tomato cage or some
staking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the staking because I can pull it
apart and I can support each nug.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a different area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can kind of do what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just surface area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically train it to like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This Cola's got this section.
[SPEAKER_03]: This Cola's got this section.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to kind of feel as many sections
as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think about what kind of
genetics you're using, like you were
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, the golden goat or the gorilla
glue makes a whole bunch of heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: The golden goat will make a whole bunch of
heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookies doesn't really like to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe grow a whole bunch of small
cookies plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just if you can do a bunch of two
foot tall, three foot tall cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to go with a plant like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do a bunch of small ones instead of
one giant plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the genetics and canopy
management, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use a fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still need fans when you're doing all
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: People forget about airflow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't stress enough about airflow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody told me they had powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: They couldn't figure out how to beat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're asking what to spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, don't spray something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a dehumidifier and clean out the air
in your room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut all that shit off.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cut all that bog shit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I see any bad shit, it's going bye bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else you got about canopy management?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to talk about something
different?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canopy management.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about the levels of your
lights during flower to help, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like an earlier new or the first couple of
weeks of flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you keep them lower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you keep them further away?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I kind of my lights don't move.
[SPEAKER_04]: I start, sometimes I'll put my plants on a
five gallon bucket to get them higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the duration of the grow,
my plants, my lights don't move.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate moving the lights down where I
hit my head on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep them as high as they'll go in the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I do is I don't change out from
the halides to the sodiums for the first
[SPEAKER_04]: two weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They stay blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they keep some, I feel like they don't
stretch as far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I do the switch, I see them start
to bulk up right away at the two weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of doing that extra week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really think that that helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have stopped doing- Do you veg with
blue lights?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those just use that, probably that
change from blue to HPS kind of gives them
[SPEAKER_03]: a time span.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to get used to that shit real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do dark periods, you know, before
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was about to say, I've stopped doing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't find it useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't do anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to veg under 24 hours and then I
would veg for 24 and then go dark for 24
[SPEAKER_04]: and then start my flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed it would trigger a little
more quickly, but yeah, it's not enough
[SPEAKER_04]: time to do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like let my plants do their
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, I just feel like when I
go, because you know, when, so I go 18 to
[SPEAKER_03]: six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually like when they sleep,
they're ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're just sleeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the prettiest person when I'm
asleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they, you know, eventually
when the lights come back on, they get
[SPEAKER_03]: into the swing of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, before the lights cut
off, they'll start going back down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I usually hit that,
I do 48 hours dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as I go in the rooms, even when
it's dark, they're already praying and
[SPEAKER_03]: ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they're just preparing
themselves for the time change.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy how like the plants will be veg
looking and then that dark period and you
[SPEAKER_03]: go in there and it's like, oh shit,
they're ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants tell us what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, don't be afraid to try a different
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother plants run.
[SPEAKER_04]: On a 19.5 cycle recommended by DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the best performance I've ever
had from a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't be afraid to experiment with some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I do 18.6 in my veg areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my flower, I just go straight
12.12 because I don't really, I don't do
[SPEAKER_04]: the dark period.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do 12.12.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dark period is the only thing I do,
just start flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the best herb I've ever grown was
actually grown under a single hood and a
[SPEAKER_04]: five by five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydro hut with a 600 watt high pressure
sodium and a 400 watt metal halide in the
[SPEAKER_04]: same bulb and that grows Zilla bulb that
Hydro farm makes a double bulb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I used one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it had great flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my best pictures came from that
run of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely quality buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: My best girl of that headband cut ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you, what are you dabbing over
there, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the dude that grew the bounty
killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate you every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to talk about green works for
a minute or not green works.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I wrote it down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I keep your soil grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many of these new Instagram
names that I can't keep up on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I try to be on top of all the social
media, but there's so many things going
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have something that you want
to hear about canopy management that we
[SPEAKER_04]: missed, remind me, cause we went quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still more to talk about,
but we're we've done enough on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about some new shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you hear that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, that's a mothership rig right
over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little mothership mini with the
swing arm, mothership carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bounty killer, live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life doesn't get much better than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: The look on Spencer's face proves it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that he knows where he is
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your eyes, your hoodie and the microphone
cover are all the same shade of red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't worried.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just letting you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to drive home like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this new shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been calling it rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been calling it rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been calling it rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whichever way you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spelled R-O-S-I-N.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't argue that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw it first on Instagram from a dude
named Soil called at Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude, what do you think, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give away too much of his
tech because we're going to have him here
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will gladly support somebody trying
something new, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was listening to Hash Church today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't freak out on me because I say this
because people argue about it all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time, but it's the first non-solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water, as much as you don't believe it,
it's a solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the butane and propane, those are all
solvents, but he's just using pure heat to
[SPEAKER_03]: extract oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't use heat as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all he's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the picture of the whole slab
he posted?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw one that's rolled up in a worm or
around a car cab.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a giant one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was as big as his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been going in lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a scheduled phone interview with
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said Tuesday or Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't confirmed a specific time,
but we're going to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably just piece that right into
this episode, you guys, if I can get him
[SPEAKER_04]: to call me on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll throw that into this show,
probably right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's an interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, hopefully, with Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for pulling some time away from
your work to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm just going to... I know you're a
busy man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to get right to it and
start asking a couple of quick questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, can you explain to me a
little bit about what Rosentech is and how
[SPEAKER_04]: you got the idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosentech, I think that comes from
somebody named Compassion that I guess was
[SPEAKER_00]: an IC man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a Rosentech with a no-melt hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your hash, your no-melt,
and you can turn it into a melt by pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: all the resin out of the no-melt with a
double boiler, a bowl, and your no-melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did this different method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what rosin is is technically it's
just a form of resin obtained from my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why it's called rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I know rosin has was for both
strings, for friction so you can get...
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know where the term actually
stuck in cannabis, but that's where I know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really kind of related to resin
in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I got my idea, I mean,
it came from basically... I'm a hash bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running out of my melt,
so I decide I need to figure something
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all this no-melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember back when Selected Nicky T
put something on the IG about taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: flat iron just for pressing, just to press
out your hash, much simpler than heating
[SPEAKER_00]: up a wand or doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the right temp just to press
it out and have a proper press dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I used to take my wife's hair curler
and sometimes I'd get it too hot by
[SPEAKER_00]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would notice that it would separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the oil and then the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't think any... This was a while
back, so I didn't think anything of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just hold the parchment back up
and now I have a pressed patty that was
[SPEAKER_00]: over pressed and with too much heat,
but otherwise it was some pressed hash.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made it smokable, made it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I made it a little better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be like... How many years ago do
you think that was?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was only not too long ago,
maybe about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably about two years ago when I did
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just doing like the Frenchy tech,
anything that didn't melt, I would triple
[SPEAKER_00]: press it, try to increase the melt quality
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff didn't, some stuff did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what gave you the idea to just start
pressing straight buds without trying
[SPEAKER_04]: hashing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I ran out of my no-melt,
all my no-melt and turning it into rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoking, we just took... I don't know,
we're just sitting here smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke flour, but my thing is dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more for the expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sitting here bullshitting with my
father-in-law and I'm like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed the nug, he's like, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in between the parchment,
just like I would a rolled up ball of hash
[SPEAKER_00]: and my surprise resin squeezed out of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were both in shock, like no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I scooped up the oil, did it again,
scooped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was enough on the end, looked like a
dab, but we tried it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to my surprise, it melted to nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No residue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes even good VHL will leave a
residue sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got lucky figuring that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would call it luck, luck's the way
to say it, but I mean, if I didn't do what
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, if I didn't sit here and smoke like
I do every day and I went so much into the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate aspect of cannabis,
I wouldn't be the one to expect the luck.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man, much respect for putting in the
work, for putting in the time to get to
[SPEAKER_04]: there and for loving the extracts as much
as you do to find that for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it seems to be the thing now,
bro, you're blowing up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I posted it, I really didn't
expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it'd be like, you know,
something some of these hash makers could
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize for all their no-no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I started posting up the
flower, I was just thinking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people would be like, you know,
in awe about it, but I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, can you tell me just kind of a brief,
I know it's just a pretty simple process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me kind of briefly how you do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say it is probably the
most simplest process of extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say if you want to do it,
the most basic way to do it for anybody at
[SPEAKER_00]: home is just grab your lady's flat iron or
hair straightener, get the widest one you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital settings would be optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I mean, when I first did it,
I had it up to 420 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the turpines were, I wasn't
worried about, I was, I wanted turpines,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted that now, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to my surprise, I was pulling melts
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I've fine-tuned it a little
bit, and there's going to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in the beginning stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, fine-tuning, it's tough to
get those turps out of it, but... So you
[SPEAKER_04]: just get the straightening comb or the
flat iron and then just basically put some
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put it between the parchment and
then put it between the flat iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do it as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it between that flat iron and then
press it as hard as you can, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Press it as hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just got to practice and waste a
couple of buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't look like you're doing a
lot of buds at one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not too big of a deal to waste a
couple of nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the hair straightening anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do the press now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you doing big things now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm still, I have a lot of other
plans for something to make it a more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, it just seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can fine-tune this to make it
workable, then whatever goes on after,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just going to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep improving every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way this industry is working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing anything special to prepare
the buds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like them a little moist?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like them dry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like them crispy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like them cured?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say a properly grown, well cured bud.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is too dry, works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that might have a little too
much moisture, it probably will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had too much like trial with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had like fresh nugs and I haven't had
too many results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to be ecstatic about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's better to let the moisture come
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how the moisture is going to
affect the extract, whether we see it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see how it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, moisture, heat, and resonance
just somehow trapping in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like when you're affecting some not
properly dried IWE, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trapping moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see that being the same for this
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do certain strains work better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like Indica's or Sativa's work
better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a favorite strain that works
the best for making rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm finding that Indica's are
producing, they're having the most rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've even had some real frosty
Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only putting out like eight to
nine percent, but I've had some Indica's
[SPEAKER_00]: pull around anywhere from like nine to 22
percent, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's getting up there with the BHO
pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really depends on how much time
and effort you want to put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to sit there and do it as
point ones, I mean, you want to break the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it in a whole gram,
you're probably not going to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a big scale, it might suffice because
it's going to be how efficient the process
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So break it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more broken up, the better actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the flavor of a rosin dab compare
to like a BHO dab or a solventless dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still getting good flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to send in some of these
samples for testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was going to be one of my next
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask if you've had anything
tested or if anybody that you know has had
[SPEAKER_04]: it tested yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually foundation extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody else had some actually
Hashbrown who tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like it was pretty high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted up the results on my IG page with
the results from foundation extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 83 percent THC and
eight percent terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty intense, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing that it was made off of
a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit less control on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen any hatred from all the BHO
people, the guys that spent thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars on equipment and now you're just
doing it with a shirt press?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a little bit of hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's more of like on the daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are kind of burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most of the time there is a lot
of people are just like, just not giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, like I'll see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see some of these people like
changing their minds about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they try it, like you can't knock it
till you try it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how this industry is though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this industry, they make
decisions right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how the way the world,
it's the way the world works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when you do that,
you're going to be the one to miss out on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, if you ever get a chance,
anybody that's listening, if you get a
[SPEAKER_04]: chance, take a dab of some rosin before
you dis it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try the rosin tech yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't, don't be a hater.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bro, you'll be surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the high?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it similar to a normal dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd say it's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would compare it more to like a IWE or
like a hash dab rather than a BHO dab to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get that heavy chested feeling like
you do sometimes from a water dab or an
[SPEAKER_04]: IWE dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get that heavy chested,
like thick feeling sometimes?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it's the smoothest dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to be in Denver for the
cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still not a hundred percent sure about
the Denver cup, but we're going to most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely be in Chalice this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you were at the Denver cup,
you better find me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to test the rosin tech for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll definitely link it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make that worth our time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think you're going to enter any
contest or any cups or anything like that
[SPEAKER_04]: anytime soon, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next cup going on that we're
going to enter is Chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to prepare for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to put rosin tech in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely going to see some solvent
with heat extracted oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm hoping to have some ice wax
in as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to see what the rosin tech
does up next to ice wax and also up next
[SPEAKER_04]: to BHO.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll probably make a category for it by
the time that the event happens,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm still excited to see it in
competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I see, I mean, it's non-solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, don't they throw the clear in that
category?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're in that category.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be competing, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be right up there with those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have faith in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I've seen, people are loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact is, there's natural dirt
teams, whether it went through heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process that it went, just can't
forget that it's solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not big on smoking solvent extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very enjoyable extracts in
solvent, but my preferred smoke is
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people seem to be turning
that way lately too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see the CleanMeds movement going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely picking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for supporting the CleanMeds
movement, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more people like yourself that are
aware of what we're doing for the
[SPEAKER_04]: community and to our bodies and with our
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it and respect it a lot,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all for it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I'm going to wrap up this phone
interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you I'd only take about 15 minutes
of your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting pretty close to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can people find you on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: On SoilGrown.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at SoilGrown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or hashtag SoilGrownTech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't really do too much of the
hashtag for the SoilGrownTech.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll find, you'll see the SoilGrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just type in Rosentech and you'll
definitely find SoilGrown somewhere in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Search for Rosentech on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll definitely find this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you have any shout outs or anything
you want to give or anything you want us
[SPEAKER_04]: to look at since you've got a lot of
people listening to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something you want to say to the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say, don't knock it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't knock it until you try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember that it's CleanMeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although it's a simple extraction
process, it does take a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would call it a connoisseur's
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connoisseur's concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I truly appreciate you calling in
for the show, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever have anything else you want to
say on the show, you've got my phone
[SPEAKER_04]: number.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Denver, I look forward to
meeting you at the cup, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for giving me a shot, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being on the show, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go take a dab of some Rosentech for me and
I'll take a dab of some TURPEX BHO for
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this dude, yeah, you just heard what
he said, hopefully, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fun way to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Spence is heating me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these bounty killer live resin dabs
off the mothership.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might not be able to talk for a couple
of seconds because Spence likes to wreck
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking a drink and grabbing the dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence holds onto the rig for a little bit
of time because he knows I like to take
[SPEAKER_04]: dabs that are too hot, which we call glowy
in this crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not even like super glowy,
but it's just hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like the way I like the way I get
the dab when it's that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just smacking his mothership rig on
the table like it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's me getting super high right now
is what that sound is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sound of my brain is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like bubble wrap and fireworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brain feels like pop rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm going to say next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you what do you think of the rosin
tape, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's using equipment that everybody has.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people use flat iron.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think black people call that a pressing
comb, don't they?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the same thing?
A hot comb?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a girl that...
[SPEAKER_04]: On one show that you're on, I said you're
the only black person that's been in my
[SPEAKER_04]: house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in Southern California,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had like all kinds of black folks on my
block.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one girl, Letitia, she called it
a flat iron or a straightening comb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the same shit,
but never mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: A flat iron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these guys are using shit that's
around the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Adam Hand from Handmade Apparel,
he showed me his, what he posted his slide
[SPEAKER_04]: because of course he had a t-shirt press
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I got this game figured
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's winning.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm amazed that they're using shit
that is just kind of around the house and
[SPEAKER_04]: making earl, you know, solventless hash
that is dabble-ble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I lied.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it has more something to do
with the moisture content of how your weed
[SPEAKER_03]: is dried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like weed down here is really dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just maybe I needed to do more
pressure, something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk to him here in a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully by the time this airs,
we've got his part to piece in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually know because that
Rosentek is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if just, I'm going to talk about it
because I wanted to save it and let him
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about it, but maybe we won't get his
interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude's taking a t-shirt press and
he's modified it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he puts a layer of parchment paper,
a little layer of buds and another
[SPEAKER_04]: parchment paper and squishes it for about
four seconds and lifts it up, pulls the
[SPEAKER_04]: parchment out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got pretty much earl.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like BHO.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, slides the weed off into the floor
and stomps on it all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's pretty much got good hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some dude who has a tea jar and
just once he's done with it, he makes tea
[SPEAKER_04]: in the morning with it because it's
still... Still got stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't get it all out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to at Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he called in and did that interview,
extra super huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he didn't, still check him out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the Rosentek.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really, really cool shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I'm going through my notes here,
I have to give a big shout out to Judy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Judy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two people never gave me their addresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of those prize winners were from
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys go on Facebook and give me your
address if you want your prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have until the next episode airs to
claim your prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if those prizes are not claimed,
they will be sacrificed to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: gods and recycled for future episode
prizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else you got on your brain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, how things been, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've even grown your ass off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just getting ready for... We're going to
go on a cup tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Denver's our first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to do Oregon and possibly
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stretching out far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the smaller ones and they
accept out of state cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seattle's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the weather in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's off the chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got family there, don't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the family in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The food, the weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I got to start traveling to more of
these cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just a solo grower, so I don't have
anybody backing up my grow when I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to get away for three or four
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that third day, you start stressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I had to go to Vegas for the secret,
I was like, Oh my God, I need to go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody take me home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just go.
[SPEAKER_04]: First flight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check on the plants and then I'll fly
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all it's about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just got to walk in the room, make sure
that everything's alive one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet me, guys, what do you do when you go
out of town and you grow a pot?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you keep your plants alive when you
go out of town?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know how you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, how's that your strain you're
working on going?
[SPEAKER_04]: So right before you came over tonight,
I was at the grow space taking pictures of
[SPEAKER_04]: like 20 different phenotypes of black
cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've narrowed it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one that is definitely a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the great bud structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like a purple Laffy Taffy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a weird, and you can smell it
from far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a weird overpowering aroma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laffy Taffy's are slimy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like grape Laffy Taffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coincidence in black.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't like grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like Laffy Taffy's.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're slimy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the smell too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can open a pack of Laffy Taffy and
smell it before you eat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked in the room and I could smell
that one plant all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to single it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this little bitch right here
is going to be a winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she happened to be one of the best
purple phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: She grows a nice top cola, nice structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to use that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's one that's a little
lighter purple, but has more of a Kim dog
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one's going to be an option.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one with no purple also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or no purple at all, but tons of
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tons of trikes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a great chemi kind of funky cherry
resiny kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those three or four females are going
to get put in the room with the black
[SPEAKER_04]: cherry male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with I got a couple other girls that
are going to go in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I even want to say what
girls are going in there on the show
[SPEAKER_04]: because I got some great strain ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be some new black cherry
crosses coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That breeding project won't happen until
probably mid-summer, maybe after the
[SPEAKER_04]: summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Summer heat kind of kills some ideas
around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to shut down some things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I've got golden goat,
a reversed golden goat male.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a female that's now a male in a room
with some lemon skunks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's more lemon Jeffrey being made.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more golden goat seeds being made.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm creating sunshine girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've also put gorilla glue in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have gorilla glue golden goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to need a name for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be kind of tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even like golden goat weed,
but that might be tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I cross anything to golden goat,
it makes it more resiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: And gorilla glue is already resiny
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's also a plant in there,
a headband plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I've told this story before.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I pollinated a headband
plant, it died.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put that bitch in there again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see if we just had a bad
day or if there's something to that
[SPEAKER_04]: because I don't know what I did last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every other plant was happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't fucking with that last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't take that bukkake very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, or no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just shriveled up, shriveled up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got any shout outs you want to give to
anybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're about to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hit you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wasn't going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Maddie, Big Mike,
Michael, Sloppy, Fong, Phil, Taylor,
[SPEAKER_03]: Stephanie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorak, Nani, Seda, King, Earl.
Earl.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys have.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom and my daddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sweetest.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Earl?
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind me what kind of, I can't think of
what he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a beardy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to call him a hornytoe,
but he's a bearded dragon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, he looks like a dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you guys got him, he was like
micro-machined size.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like a thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like the size of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: His head to tail was the size of my thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now he's like the length of my thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: My arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that dude looks crazy now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like a fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sits in his cage like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the only like reptiles that
when you say his name, he'll turn and like
[SPEAKER_03]: look at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like you can hear his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have a snake.
[SPEAKER_03]: She, she kicks it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Earl is on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a picture of a booty in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd be up there like scratching the
booty.
[SPEAKER_04]: The garden of Weedon House is definitely
one of the funnest places to hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know what's going to go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's chaotic, but they got the hookups
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all comfy and chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smokers Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be doing a booth at the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden of Weedon Smokers Club booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for me there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be hanging out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be, it's going to be a good
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy 420 and come hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's going to be mad at me because
I'm going to be out of seeds by the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the first day of the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time I get to Denver, I'll be there
Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the end of Friday night,
I could be out of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to buy mine before the cup even
starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well you're here now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, uh, let's talk in a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a box over here with some Irish
stickers all over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what's in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do owe a big, huge shout out to Green
and Healthy Cannabis in Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for the Terpex on the
low, low cheap, man, they got the Durbin
[SPEAKER_04]: Poison Wax that is fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't even hype you up on that
because by the time you get there,
[SPEAKER_04]: that Durbin will be gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll have some brand new shit that'll
be even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he just tag us and stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: He tagged us in a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they love us.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the drop happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, uh, it was probably Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause, uh, I don't know what day is it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it was Saturday.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a new drop Saturday of new good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every few days they get new drops of
great, great medicine over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green and Healthy Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 212 21st street.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's South 21st.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pull up the track.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want the address?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 212 South 21st street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, if you're in Denver, if you're in
Pueblo, if you are, what's, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's West of Colorado Springs mountains,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in those mountains, if you're in
Manitou Springs, if you're in what's to
[SPEAKER_04]: the East, that's, uh, that's just the
Plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're out there on the Plains,
if you're in Payton, you're up in Diamond
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave's neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: No shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Negative shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no shout out at all for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I take no, um, yeah, if you're in that
area, go to Green Healthy Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And get yourself some Terpex medicine on
the cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, I don't rep other dispensaries
very often.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Green Healthy Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where Hunt is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where the Terpy boys are.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the homies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be on, I think they'll be
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going up there Thursday to record with
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm ahead of myself because an episode
came out today and then I've got one
[SPEAKER_04]: prerecorded and then I've got this one and
then I'll have Hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's going to get fucking awesome
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have shows coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, uh, I think the show I did last
week, I'll put it out on a Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a Wednesday show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched this, uh, have you seen,
uh, like the Colbert report?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's one, I think it's Kean Peele
maybe, but he was doing like a black
[SPEAKER_03]: Colbert report and they were talking about
Ferguson and it was fucking hilarious,
[SPEAKER_03]: dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably one of the funniest shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ain't going to talk about it,
but it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys got to watch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, what's your guys name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bung Lao?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just Google Buck Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buck Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buck Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say Buck Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say Bung Lao because,
uh, they're Joe, uh, Joe Coy does a
[SPEAKER_04]: character called Bung Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got them confused, but,
uh, on YouTube type in Russell phone
[SPEAKER_04]: pranks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I can't think of the fucking name of
the show right now, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: Google it because it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy deserves a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He entertained me the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Fong too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Fong is, Fong is where I originate
on my Asian voices.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going there?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Onage pranks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_04]: Onage pranks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this guy kills it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're bored, you got some time to
kill, check out YouTube, check out Onage
[SPEAKER_04]: pranks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, any of the ones with Tyrone in them
are fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all one guy doing all those voices.
[SPEAKER_04]: He calls people and harasses them,
but he does call and apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's not a total dick, but that's my
recommendation for the week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done a recommendation for the
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess now that I've said that,
I'm going to have to recommend something
[SPEAKER_04]: every fucking week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend a mother shit next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the week after that, uh,
vector torches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the week after that, uh,
root beer, root beer shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the week after that, we're going
to go with the Gmail from Emotech.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's plenty of recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should get shout out to Emotech.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be long enough for you to
forget.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, giddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need one for my car, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have one with like a power
converter that plugs into the mini that
[SPEAKER_04]: can plug it later?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a suction cup on it or something,
some Velcro so we can Velcro that bitch to
[SPEAKER_04]: the dash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a radio attachment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cigarette lighter hookup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to do a dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to do the closing part of
the show right after this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, that was a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say something interesting, Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not really an interesting person,
but I'm nice with a carb cap though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's what I need from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy likes to give me big fat nasty
dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows how I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like big dabs either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make other people do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop rocks in the brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I remembered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my brain is sticky now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap it up
because I'm super duper high, like level
[SPEAKER_04]: 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't going to fall over or nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already in a chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you played Destiny?
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be what everybody's hooked on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you like those sports games,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like basketball, football, but recently
I've been playing Grand Theft Auto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five stars cruising.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Tony, if you have my Grand Theft Auto
five minutes, let me get that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I just got inspired.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we can play online.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got an Xbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, then we can't be bros online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sure to play station.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence kills it on the basketball game
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody at the house can beat him.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all pissed off at him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I go over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the rest of all football.
[SPEAKER_04]: The UFC one is fun to watch you guys play
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think someone's going to break a
controller one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have almost, I'm I'm broke right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've like slammed it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke more weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get so stressed out over the video
games, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: End of the show right onto the Garden of
Weed and crew for going to the gym.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the gym, the fitness.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys have been killing it with their
fitness.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that on another episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some healthy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't always have to talk about just
weed because this is part of our part of
[SPEAKER_04]: what we're doing too weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think taking good care of my plants has
taught me to take better care of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've said that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again for listening to another
episode.
