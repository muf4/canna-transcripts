[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 416 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to add fresh genetics to your
garden and I highly recommend Oregon Elite
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Oregon Elite Seeds
on 420 because we are releasing the brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new Blue Raspberry Truffle from Iri
Genetics on Oregon Elite Seeds on 420 so
[SPEAKER_00]: don't miss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous chunky dab of
Tropicana Cookies Ambrosia from Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up this four gram jar at their
Ambrosia Day special over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got just a little bit left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells funky, delicious,
and perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Tropicana Cookies
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get a good aroma so I can
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has got a hint of grapefruit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is amazingly delicious and I do
approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tropicana Cookies is quickly becoming
one of my favorite concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, in this episode, I am going to
read some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's do a few
shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to our friend
Sam?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big Viking handshake to our
friend Grimble the Druid?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to Eric
Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to my friend Richard
Memel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast to our friend David O'Quinn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Podcast World, 420 is quickly
approaching and I keep asking for input on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what does 420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com or contact
[SPEAKER_00]: me on Twitter at GFYHpodcast and let me
know what 420 means to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Podcast World, let's get into
this first email for today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Rasta Jeff, thank you for all of
your help in the herb garden, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have interacted a couple of times
before, sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appeared as, and then they actually
typed a name in here, but I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: read it out of respect on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep these folks anonymous and
keep them safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I appeared as blank on your old
forum just before it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also popped up as blank on a recent live
chat you did and you corrected my fish
[SPEAKER_00]: spelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Patreon, I appear as blank and I guess
I have a severe case of internet paranoia
[SPEAKER_00]: due to prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we've got to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be careful and we've got to
cover our own asses, which is why I've
[SPEAKER_00]: made sure not to reveal any of the names
you have listed here in this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, much respect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No stress there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep coming back with a new name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep following and I will appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I was listening to another
podcast that also had a Patreon account
[SPEAKER_00]: and they pointed out that people say they
will support someone, but then rarely
[SPEAKER_00]: commit to the price of a cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought to myself, yeah, I definitely
owe Rasta Jeff a few brews for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: help I have received from the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's up, good sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got you covered in a small way for
one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen your name pop up on Patreon
and I try to give you some shout outs
[SPEAKER_00]: discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, big thanks for that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see you and I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink coffee, but you are taking
good care of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're keeping the podcast up for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're providing new microphone cover so I
don't have to spit into this same funky
[SPEAKER_00]: cover forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're keeping the website updated and you
are keeping the internet connection kept
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I do appreciate stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that help.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, Just to let you know that with
your help, I have grown some seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: dank THC CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a one to one ratio that has utterly
transformed someone's life who was
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosed with stage four liver and bowel
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here is the best part of this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all capital letters with three
exclamation points, the next sentence is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person does not have stage four liver
and bowel cancer anymore because this
[SPEAKER_00]: person was able to grow some seriously
dank one to one THC to CBD medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues and it says,
we stopped it growing and we shrunk the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancers until the doctors could go in and
remove what was left.
[SPEAKER_00]: At stage four, this is real and then a
bunch of exclamation points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the enthusiasm in the words in this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited that cannabis is able to do
this and I am excited that with my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and my guidance and my little
podcast, I'm just talking into a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone and putting it on the internet
and it is making this person's life
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making this patient's life better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making their caregiver's life
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making their entire family and
everyone around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their life is a little bit better because
we are able to make one person's life more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable and make their life better and
it is just rippling out in a circle and
[SPEAKER_00]: making a lot of people's lives easier and
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's amazing that cannabis can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you for stepping up and
growing this medicine and I'm proud of you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys for stopping stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep listening to the new shows and
the old again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the knowledge you have imparted in
between the dads and the guests and the
[SPEAKER_00]: news and all the other great stuff you do
on the show is pure gold that only comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from total dedication to your craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Messages like this, updates and news like
this make this podcast make all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, the time, the effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small expense of paying for a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is very worth it when I
receive a message saying that my guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: helps somebody beat stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have done a year of podcasting
without any Patreon contributions,
[SPEAKER_00]: without any of the high fives,
without the pat on the back reaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to know that we're helping one person
with stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we talked about a
child with autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cannabis is helping and this little
podcast is helping people grow better
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest level, professional,
cutting edge, cannabis specific,
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening wisdom at my fingertips for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mind if I do, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mind if I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says fist bump in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big old fist bump, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, love and light from
Manchester, England.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also great to hear that the podcast
is getting such a wide reach we are being
[SPEAKER_00]: listened to in Manchester, England.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know we were getting that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the beautiful,
amazing message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some energy into this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some time into this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me however long the episode is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me that plus a little bit longer
to record the episode because I probably
[SPEAKER_00]: cut out a few minutes that you didn't hear
because I get more rambly than I allow you
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it takes however long the show was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to listen back to it and edit it
just because I want to make sure I took
[SPEAKER_00]: out all the bullshit rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is some cleaning up to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I post the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I make the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do the tweeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's the writing and the
pre-production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a little bit of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying there's some work to be
done when you've got a podcast that puts
[SPEAKER_00]: out a minimum of two episodes per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for somebody just to say, hey,
with the help of your podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: we beat stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to hear more emails just like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got them, please send them to me
because it really puts a smile on my face
[SPEAKER_00]: and it cheers me up and it shows the power
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reaching for the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, I hope all is well with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love your podcast and I have
learned a ton from you and White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for listening to the show and
check it out, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting another mention,
so we need to get you back over real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, very much a novice grower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last season, I grew two plants from seed
through to flower and I have to say the
[SPEAKER_00]: end results did not suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, congratulations, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad they didn't totally suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues and it says,
I plan on growing a few more plants this
[SPEAKER_00]: year from seed and I was looking for your
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be growing outdoors in five gallon
buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first of all, I would recommend
larger pots, five gallon buckets in the
[SPEAKER_00]: thick of summer when it gets real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in full sun, you are going to be
watering those probably twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got the access,
the time, the energy, the ability,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the setup to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe think about larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is an option, if you've got that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always go bigger than you think you need
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to grow rapidly
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to drink a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say go with the bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use ocean forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may amend it with a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say with a handful of red wiggler
worms in each pot and then pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please suggest nutrients, recharge,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use pots outdoors and
you are looking for nutrient suggestions,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to go full organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do amended soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do a super soil type of a
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to use bottled nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make that decision long before
it is time to put these plants into your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make a super soil,
that needs time to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make a living soil,
it may need some time to come alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use bottled nutrients,
you just need to buy some things,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn the recipe, and start feeding the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to feed them is up to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to feed your plants in
organic amended soil, there are a few
[SPEAKER_00]: things you need to make sure you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some sort of a Cal Mag or a
calcium and magnesium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need the 16 essential
minerals for healthy plant development in
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil because you are not going to add
anything, but basically water throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth cycle seems to be your plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do that, whip up a
really nice batch of soil that has
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a lot of great recipes online
for a super soil, or you can go to
[SPEAKER_00]: buildasoil.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to buildasoil.com and you can
get very good soil mixing recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also buy all of the amendments
right there on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you at least have some
sort of a nitrogen source in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a phosphorus, a potassium
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a calcium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a magnesium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need everything a plant
needs inside of that soil because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't plan on giving it any other
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are many ways of providing
those nutrients, those elements through
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use bone meal, blood meal,
fish meal, feather meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of different meals
available at your local grow store,
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm supply store, your garden store,
your hydro store will have all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of products if that is the way you
want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you go back and listen
to some of the older episodes with Sean or
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and listen to some of their soil
building and soil amending ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a great start on
getting your soil amended for your outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the first thing I would do is start
with larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely the first thing that
they would probably recommend also.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you listen to those shows,
they're going to say probably a 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 15 or a 20 gallon pot for your outdoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to do that, you're going
to need some of these different bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottles are very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are effective in an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix them up just like you would your
indoor grow nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may not be familiar with an
indoor grow mix, so let's talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do some research and find a brand
that gets your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something will stand out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of brands available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your aim is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to stay organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to go full
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want a lot of bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want just a couple of
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're a mad scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you just want to keep it
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your style or your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find a brand that gets your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go to that brand's website,
and again, I would find their nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this several times on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that brand's nutrient calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll ask you which bottles you've
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell it how many weeks you want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably want to flower somewhere
between eight and nine weeks, so type in
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, nine weeks flower time,
and it will make you a detailed recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed it very closely to what that
recipe recommends, but I would reduce most
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things by probably 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it says feed it four of something,
only give it three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says feed it 100, only give it 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't un-feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see it burning, you've given it too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see it hungry, you can give it
more, but you can't take away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start light and increase if you see
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, when it comes to selecting
bottled nutrients, make sure you have got
[SPEAKER_00]: the 16 basic building blocks for plant
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
calcium, and magnesium at least to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the other things will be included
in most of those other bottles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll get it all figured out,
but be careful that you are including all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things necessary for healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also asked about recharge or et
cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always recommend some recharge or
some sort of micro product in my garden if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to help you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of recharge will really give
those plants a nice boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something I would really recommend you
pay a lot of attention to, to an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, is your integrated pest management
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to keep the bugs away
from your precious cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are spending a lot of time thinking
about the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to feed these plants
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be big, fat, healthy,
gorgeous, sexy, potent cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to think about keeping the
bugs and the pests away from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do something in the
amended soil that promotes a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that does not want pests, that keeps the
pests away?
[SPEAKER_00]: A living organic soil situation can make
that possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not doing that sort of a thing,
you are going to need to figure out a
[SPEAKER_00]: better strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use predator bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use applied pesticides
through sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your plan from keeping these bugs
away from your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use sprays, please use something
that is very gentle and mild to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is your small patch of land,
but it is on our earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be very gentle with everything
you spray outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend too many sprays in an
outdoor situation because that does
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupt the natural ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand that those plants are
precious and sometimes we've got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've got to do to keep specific
things away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful with your integrated
pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan to use predator bugs to keep
the bad bugs away, do very good research
[SPEAKER_00]: on which bugs will work in your
environment and be prepared by the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate bug for the appropriate
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in an area that doesn't get
thrips, you don't need to worry about bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that eat thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in an area that is known for
getting russet mites or spotted mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you have predator mites in place
in advance before those predator mites or
[SPEAKER_00]: those spotted mites come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've covered the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either need some good bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get bottled nutrients, follow the
nutrient calculator online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is usually very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not very familiar with bottled
nutrients, I recommend you get one brand
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy what you can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get the base, the micro,
the grow, the bloom, and then fill in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gaps from there as you can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend some Kalmag and then a
bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I always recommend some sort of
microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to go bottles,
that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go amended soil,
you have got endless options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've decided how you want to do
your soil inputs, build up a nice soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to feed a tea late in flower
if the plants become deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a bloom booster tea late
in flower anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be something else you want to
read about and learn about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are talks of that with Sean and
Jesse and myself in previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find those, those would be very
beneficial to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing you need to think about
is the integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the bugs away from these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you may need to think about
is keeping the people away from your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got that figured out,
you should be on your way to a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with your email because
there is more and I've already been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm looking for something
relatively simple for a new grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read that Blue Dream is relatively
easy to grow outdoors and is somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to powdery mildew and root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a saying in our little group
here about Blue Dream and it is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: joke but it is also kind of serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people around here have a sticker
on their torch or on their rig case or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe on their email and that sticker
says, fuck Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because Blue Dream just got worn
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time period where if you
wanted to buy weed from a black market
[SPEAKER_00]: dealer, he had Blue Dream and it was
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tired of the smell of Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tired of smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tired of smoking Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of jokes about Blue Dream
being mediocre weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, Blue Dream produces quite well
in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream produces quite well in an
outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would work well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't think a lot of people
will be interested in smoking Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is a very old retired strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is what you enjoy, smoke it,
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the market has moved far past Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to put it on the
market, I don't think Blue Dream will do
[SPEAKER_00]: well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need something a little more
modern, a little more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend something from my line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow outdoors from the
IRE genetics line, I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew is very resistant to mold and
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finishes on time for your outdoor crop
and it smells and tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunshine puts a super funky foot,
skunky Chem 91 kind of aroma to the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning dew when you grow it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a beautiful plant for the
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is a cross of flow and a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow makes it finish quite early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps it short and squat and really
stout plants that are beautiful for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one I would recommend for outside
is Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss is a cross of Platinum Tangi and a
rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platinum Tangi was made by our friends
at Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to those kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see you when you come back
to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Platinum Tangi to a rise makes
beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay fairly short, fairly squat,
and they are very robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got really strong branches,
really beefy stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really stands up to the outdoor wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known for not getting powdery mildew
or any sort of molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it finishes quite early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably my earliest finishing
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Sunkiss is another great one for
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of my line, again, I would
recommend Morning Dew, Prana, or Sunkiss
[SPEAKER_00]: for some outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend Morning Dew for those
who are out in the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend Morning Dew for those
who are out in the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: By saying, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to any and all suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, buddy, and signed his name and
gave his phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are... No, I'm just kidding.
