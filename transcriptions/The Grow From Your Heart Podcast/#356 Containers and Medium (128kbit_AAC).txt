[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 356 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start these shows
off by letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a big fat dab of some coffee
nectar from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Alien Kush and Alien OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's described as dark roast coffee and
watermelon candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this one on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely does have that coffee
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the lingering aftertaste is a little
bit of coffee with that sweet watermelon
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an accurate description there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs and excellent work on the coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be another grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the fifth lesson in a long
series of grow lessons I've got planned
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lesson will be more about selecting
our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point in the grow lessons,
we should have a good goal for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good place for our grow
planned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good idea of the
equipment that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you should have a good idea of
how to set up all of that gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've got a good grow room
running, let's talk about pots and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll work our way into our
nutrient options.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to selecting containers for
our plants, we've got a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can select net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can select plastic nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there are waffle pots, also known as
root pots available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people get various sizes of bags
of soil and cut the top off a bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pack that soil down into the bag
really tight and you can grow your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: directly in there if that's what you want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these methods have their pros and
cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing to focus on when selecting
your pots is drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pots need holes on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be watering and feeding our
plants a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's nowhere for that excess water
to go, it's just going to build up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to create a mud puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will drown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots will drown in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need plenty of holes for drainage in
the bottom of our pot, no matter what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of pot we select.
[SPEAKER_00]: The net pots I talked about, those are
mostly holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your nursery pots, they should come with
holes already in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fabric pots, they provide plenty of
drainage by being a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waffle pot does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, when I'm saying a waffle
pot, I mean those air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a waffle maker with a bunch
of holes in it and sometimes it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: rivets that you can undo and you can
unroll the pot and take the root ball out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can manipulate the root ball and
then put the pot back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can up pot it at that time,
but that's what I mean when I'm saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: waffle pots, they're air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like somebody rolled them out
with a waffle maker and then made a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see those when you go to the grow
store and you go shopping for pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use whatever container you've got
available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to go buy a bunch of
five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to recycle some sort
of container that they use frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fine as long as you make some
drainage holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often, I start my baby plants,
whether seeds or clones, in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: When football season starts or during the
Super Bowl, those beer cups go on sale
[SPEAKER_00]: super cheap, stock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a few bags of beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I stack them up about eight or 10
tall and I use a drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take a power drill with a long bit
and I poke a hole right through the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the center of eight to 10 cups at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip, zip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did 20 cups and they've got holes
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got one big drainage hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll also go through and make one or
two more holes on the side of each cup
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got three solid drainage holes in
a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get any root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get stagnant water in
the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great way to segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to segue into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way into pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need a pot that is the appropriate
size for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start small plants in small
pots, either a beer cup, maybe a four,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that, why do you want to
put a little tiny plant with a little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in a big pot Let's say you put
it in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all that extra space in there
for those roots to just swim around in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's extra space that you need to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to require more water,
which will require more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're going to have to spread the
plants out more if they're in larger pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you may require more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: By keeping them in smaller pots,
it keeps the garden more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps things more cost effective and
it's easier to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start my babies off in a little tiny
pot and when it's time I transplant them
[SPEAKER_00]: into a one or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll finish my plants in that
one or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times I will either skip the three
gallon and go straight into a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot or I'll go from the cup into a three
gallon into a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about deciding which size
pot to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know which size pot to transplant
into?
[SPEAKER_00]: That all depends on how long that plant is
going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on how big that plant is
going to be in the end of its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you going to veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you going to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pot size will also play a huge factor
into how frequently you need to water your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running little one gallon pots
and you've got semi large plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to water every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got semi large plants,
but you're running seven or 10 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, you can go in, dump a bunch of water
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave those for two, three,
sometimes four or five days, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how far into your cycles you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pot size is going to make a huge
difference on how frequently you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the size of the plant
and the size of our container.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing vigorous cannabis plants,
I would suggest approximately a two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallon pot for every 12 inches of
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a 12 inch tall plant,
you want about a two or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking about your finished plant
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plant's going to finish about
12, maybe 18 inches tall, that's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: want a two or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll get them about 24 inches
tall in that three gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's really pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm watering every single day and
they're thirsty at the start of every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plants are going to finish
around 12, 18, maybe 24 inches at the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum height, then you can go in a two
to three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow bigger plants,
you need bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go to like a two foot tall
plant, that's when I would definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend three to five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five gallon pot is very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we want bigger plants, we obviously
need to move into bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want about a 36 inch to a 42 inch
plant, maybe just a little bit bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you need to work with the five
to seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you start going past five feet in
an indoor grow, it starts kind of becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: a pain in the ass unless you're in a
commercial grow with gavitas up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling and you've got all that ceiling
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a five or six foot tall plant is
really as tall as I would recommend in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow unless you're really pushing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to push out a big six foot
monster in the garage or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you want to push into a 10,
maybe a 12 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to be sure to have enough
root space to support these giant plants
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to select the appropriate container
for the appropriate plant size you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind that you can start small
and you can always up pot that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend up potting during
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's critical, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see you transplant
probably 10 days, maybe seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days, maybe five days before you put it
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can if you're good at it and
you're not going to shock the plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can transplant it the day you flip
into flower and you can put it into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that day as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't disrupt anything,
as long as you don't piss that plant off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've given it any shock, if you're
not experienced with transplanting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would certainly give it a few days to
recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's not getting transplanted and
triggered into flower and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: life out all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that plant a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about the height and size
of a plant in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the pros and the cons
of small pots versus large pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small pots, let's talk about the advantage
of using small containers in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a smaller container, you don't need
as much water, which means you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: as much nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to that is you may need to
water more frequently once the plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be in there watering twice a day
if your pots are too small for your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of small pots is that
you can fit the plants closer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't take up as much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall to that is you don't have as
much space for branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a drain that just does
one stick straight up and doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of side branching, maybe smaller pots
are ideal because you can get them closer
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage to smaller pots are
mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people aren't able-bodied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people need some assistance and large
pots may not be ideal for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small pots may be the way to go for
people who aren't physically able to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage a five or seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these pots are filled with medium,
if we're going to put cocoa, if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put soil, we're going to put a
soil mix, whatever we put in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you add a plant in there,
then you add a gallon of water to a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got quite a bit of weight to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not an able-bodied person or if
you've got anything slowing you down,
[SPEAKER_00]: that pot may not move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be stuck right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the advantages of smaller pots
is mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we work our way into larger pots,
we do have different advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: One advantage of larger pots is less
frequent watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage to that is it takes more
to water at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we've got a seven gallon pot and
the plant's in about week three of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've given that plant a chance to dry
out a little bit and it's actually thirsty
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's prime time for water,
that plant may take at least a gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a gallon and a half, possibly two
full gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a lot more water to
water that larger pot, but we're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to need to water it for probably three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my favorite advantage to running large
seven gallon pots is bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a bigger pot, you can get a bigger
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to consider when
thinking about pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing to think about is how big
will your plant be in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a big enough home for your plant
at its finished size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something to help you kind of think
about pot size is plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we are strictly limited by
the amount of plants we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how big those plants
are, but the number is what they go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere like Colorado with a limited
plant count, that's where we start growing
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having a whole bunch of little
plants under one light, we just put one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant under a light and veg it for a long
time and then flower that out and we try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get one to two pounds out of one plant
under one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant count is a huge factor to keep in
mind when thinking about pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you don't have a plant count,
your options are limitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run little four inch by four inch
Rockwell cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put 64 of those on a four by four
tray and you can absolutely pull easily a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound underneath one light with 64 little
plants and very little veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want bigger plants, you can do
nine three gallon pots under a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to go bigger, that's when I
would start recommending like four seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots under a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to go even bigger,
maybe do one or two 10 gallons or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just one 12 gallon pot underneath a
thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the pros and cons or the
advantages and disadvantages of larger and
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about different types of pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over some of the types of pots
that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net pots are usually available in four or
six inch diameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't very deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only about three or four inches
deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like somebody took a pot and
then just cut a bunch of holes out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it more like a mesh, more like a
spaghetti strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to that is that it gets a
lot of airflow so you don't ever overwater
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get plenty of wet and dry cycling
and you get a lot of oxygen to your root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall with the net pots is being so
small and allowing all that airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do require frequent watering once the
plants start building a good root system
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next pots I talked about were our
basic nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the plastic pots we are all
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a lot of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are square.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are available in black or white.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors, I may
recommend a white pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's available in the size you're
looking for, indoors I don't think it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pots are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why they are the industry
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in any size and volume you need
and they are also very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are your basic nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to those is they don't dry
out as quickly as a root pot or an air
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have more time between
waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is less root growth and
slower root growth because that restricted
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: More airflow allows more root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows the plants to dry more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a balance there between plastic
pots and fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to segue into fabric
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabric pots are available in many sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them as small as a half gallon
and I've seen them as big as 200 gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the advantages of the
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of airflow to your root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots love airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also helps us prevent overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you do overwater, that pot's not
going to hold it because it is fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water will just run right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really advantageous with the
large pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your air pots, your fabric pots are going
to dry out much more quickly than a
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic pot because of all that airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest buying a little larger pot
if you're going to run fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run five gallon plastic
pots, consider seven gallon fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that extra time so that you don't have
to water and your roots are just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow more quickly with those air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend that extra space just
to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage to fabric pots is faster
growing, more productive roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is you're going to have
to water more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about those air pots or the
waffle pots I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those things all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great for the same reason as the
fabric pots because your roots get oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: from all directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about them is they
have got rivets on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's time to up pot your pot,
you don't have to lift that root ball up
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can undo the rivets and that pot
unwraps off of your root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can gently pick that root ball up
and set it into your up pot container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your plant is up potted,
all you have to do is pop the rivets back
[SPEAKER_00]: in and you can reuse that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to destroy it to get the
plant out of there and the plant didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get destroyed to get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the advantage to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is the same as the fabric
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They require more frequent watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a basic breakdown of the three
most common types of pots you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: run into when shopping for pots for your
new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what type of pot you select,
you're going to need something under that
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect the runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you'll need some sort of
saucer or a tray underneath your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're going to put all of your
pots on a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about when you water,
that's all going to run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to collect that water somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're running it all off into a
table, it's all got to get to a drain
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just running it into saucers,
you may need to get a shop vac and suck
[SPEAKER_00]: that water out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave those plants sitting in
stagnant water for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically covers the pots and the
part that goes on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking for about 16 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's getting a little dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head's getting a little clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get back, we will talk
about selecting our medium for our new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm taking a couple of dabs,
I'm going to drop in a quick promotion for
[SPEAKER_00]: my Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this podcast because I love cannabis
and because I love helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see you grow the best cannabis
you can grow so you can provide that for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and people that rely on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few costs involved in
producing and hosting a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to help offset those
costs and further my efforts in producing
[SPEAKER_00]: a quality show, you can do so by

[SPEAKER_00]: This show will always be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you would like to help,
I would truly appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get right back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got all my problems solved and I'm ready
to continue with this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the medium we're going to
select for our new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Media that is what's going to go inside of
our pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what our plant is going to grow
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to choose soil, a soilless
mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to cook up a batch of super
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want some living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to do a T-L-O or a no-till
sort of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're just going to grow in rock
wool cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I don't have a lot of
information in this episode for our hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, but I will put together an entire
hydro segment in the future for our
[SPEAKER_00]: waterborne friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, let's talk about soil and
soilless mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will tell you that they
are growing in soil when actually they are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the main differences
between soil and a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A soilless mix is right between a soil and
a hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soilless mix looks just like soil or dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is there are no nutrients
in a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soilless mixes are basically peat or cocoa
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your soilless mixes will have
plenty of aeration added to them like
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite or volcanic rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soilless mixes are great because they give
us complete control over what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that leads us right into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference between a soilless
blend and soil is the soil will have
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our store bought soil mixes will
have the same things as a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have the perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have the peat moss in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will also contain organically
decomposed matter that make the soil rich
[SPEAKER_00]: in micro and macro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantage to that is that you
don't need to feed your plants as heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: if at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is you don't need to feed
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have control over what you're
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are already nutrients in that medium
and you may not know exactly what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also eventually those nutrients will be
eaten up and you will need to either
[SPEAKER_00]: re-amend that soil or start using bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main difference between soil
and a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are going to go with a soilless
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the soil and soilless mixes
available at your local grow shop will be
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for you to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try not to recommend specific
products and specific brands but I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this easy for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farms Ocean Forest Soil is available
everywhere and it will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to hate me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to love me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fine if that's what's available to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will do a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Roots Organics makes a quality soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I'm going to get lovers and haters
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make this easy for new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a big bale of soil it's going
to work very well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunshine Mix Number 4 is very cost
effective and it is a quality product for
[SPEAKER_00]: a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to stay away from specific
products but those will work for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and I know they are available at
most reputable grow shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to grow in a soil eventually
you may need to re-amend that soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: start watering with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go with the soilless mix you do
need to start feeding nutrients right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we'll need to start thinking
about organics or synthetics or boxes or
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that gives us a beautiful segue into
pre-made soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't want to use bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be more sustainable and they
want to be more organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best options to do that are things
like super soil or other living soils or
[SPEAKER_00]: TLO or a no-till setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're using these pre-made soils you
don't need to add bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: because everything is already in the
medium available to the plant as the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about what I mean
by super soil or a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to argue with me but
we're going to put them in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: category for the sake of this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A super soil or a living soil is exactly
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a soil that is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is filled with microbes and beneficial
fungus and bacteria and all of the macro
[SPEAKER_00]: and micro nutrients we need to get our
plant through the growth cycle and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of times people add a few bonus items in
there like some volcanic rock dust or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your secret ingredient may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a super soil you basically gather all
of your ingredients and the way I would do
[SPEAKER_00]: it I would throw a large tarp on the
ground in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix up all of the ingredients
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be bags of a base mix
which will probably be a soilless mix that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably get from a grow store and
then a lot of amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your style of growing and
what you want to do the amendments will
[SPEAKER_00]: vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've heard Sean and Jesse on the show
before you know we're probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put some alfalfa in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably put some caranja in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably be some neem cakes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all just depends on the style of your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use animal products you can
put blood meal, bone meal and fish meal in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always put oyster shell stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put kelp meal in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that type of stuff will go into a
living soil or a super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will get mixed up and put into a
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a little water will be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make everything come to life in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing a little white fungus
on top of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why we call it living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a living soil or a super soil idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find plenty of recipes online.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google subcooled super soil recipe
you will find it I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also go to build a soils website
and I'm sure they will give you plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: information on building a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me talk briefly about the pros and
cons of a living soil or a super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: First it's a lot of ingredients to gather
but they are affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably more cost-effective than
buying a bunch of bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gather your ingredients then you've
got to mix them yourself which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fun if you're into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into that it's a giant pain
in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lay out a giant tarp in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weigh out and measure out your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's work to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a specified time depending on
your ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs about 30 maybe 45 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs prep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another downfall is a lot of those organic
amendments are not completely reliable on
[SPEAKER_00]: their nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding a bunch of things to a bunch
of other things and cooking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may come out a little richer or a
little lighter than we expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not an experienced grower a
super soil may throw your plants off and
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have no idea how to adjust and
correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the major downfalls to a
living soil for a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix everything properly and you
know how to pay attention to the plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil and a super soil can do
beautiful things for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you really want to step your game
up you can go TLO which means true living
[SPEAKER_00]: organics or you can go no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have a lot of experience
in either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Sean and Jesse's department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both crush it with the TLO and with
the living organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when you start involving worms
into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when so with the no-till garden
we're never taking anything to the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically harvesting a plant and
then where the hole from that plant was we
[SPEAKER_00]: put another plant and then backfill it
with a little bit of compost that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: made ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waste from the plant after we harvest
it goes back into our compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reuse almost everything in a no-till
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again with the TLO and a no-till
environment it does take some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare and set up that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good thing about a no-till all of my
no-till friends tell me it gets better
[SPEAKER_00]: with every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought everything for the no-till
grow they set it up one time and they got
[SPEAKER_00]: it going and they got it dialed in and
they grew a crop and those plants came out
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pulled out that root ball they put
that in the compost bin they put a fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in there they added some compost
they re-amended they put some cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plant or on the pot and then it
grew in there the whole plant grew again
[SPEAKER_00]: they said that second crop was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time Frosty was here I think he
said he was on his seventh run with his
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till crop and it is getting better
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if every time you grew in the dirt
it got better.
[SPEAKER_00]: A normal soil or a soil-less mix guy is
either throwing that away or trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find some way to recycle it and it's a
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage there of the no-till is
you are recycling all of your grow to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very sustainable and it is 100%
organic if you keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is it takes a lot of time to
set up and it's 100% organic so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a problem you have to research 100%
organic methods to correct your issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go to the store buy a bottle of
something shake it up apply it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and think you've solved your
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so easy in a no-till environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it takes a little more
thinking but it also looks like it is much
[SPEAKER_00]: more rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends that grow the no-till weed it
really tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pros of the no-till and the TLO
grow is it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're putting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that you're going to have a clean
tasty product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it's being self-sustained.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to introduce a bunch of
funky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to keep buying products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no bottles to throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside is it takes a little while to
get your medium started before you can
[SPEAKER_00]: even put a plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I honestly don't have enough
experience with a super soil a living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: a TLO or a no-till grow to talk about like
I'm an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you the best of my
knowledge from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there is more to think about when
it comes to those types of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more advanced techniques in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've talked about soil and soilless
mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of experience growing in
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to set up a commercial grow
today and I had a budget that I could do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I wanted with we would run a
cocoa setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cocoa with a lot of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like cocoa because cocoa doesn't hold on
to any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like cocoa because it is inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not contain any nutrients when you
buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just clean medium that the plants
can hang out in and the roots really seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to be comfortable in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to control everything when it
comes to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to control every nutrient that
goes in there and I really like the wet
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry time with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A well aerated cocoa wet and dry time is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing about cocoa it kind of works
like hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to feed my cocoa grow twice a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pump nutrients through that grow two
times every day which means those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are really eating heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of tips if you choose cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you rinse your cocoa before you
put your plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where you got your cocoa
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where they got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where it was stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rinse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can just fill a pot with it if
that's what you need to do put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant pot and then just run a bunch of
water through it to where you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: the water clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would really be beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also when you're running cocoa you may
need more cow mag than you're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said nothing stays in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the cow mag just falls
right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got runoff water that cow mag
went right on out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hanging out in the medium like it
would if you had soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing for it to hang on to in
the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa doesn't grab it like a soil or
soilless mix would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of basic tips if you choose to
go in cocoa would be make sure you rinse
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be salty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put your plants in that
salty environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then increase your cow mag and possibly
you may need to increase your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend feeding every day when you're
growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in soil or a soilless mix you
may be only feeding once a week or twice a
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed every single day in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you water those plants put some
nutrients in there if you're growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times in the big grow we would
give them a big watering, a big feeding to
[SPEAKER_00]: start the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get their whatever else we were
feeding them that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a whole list of stuff we'd feed the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd feed them that early in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right before we leave a lot of times
we would just shoot just a small feed of
[SPEAKER_00]: just base nutrients and cow mag through at
the end of the day just to make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were wet by the time we got there
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really liked being fed twice a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first time we would feed them a big
fat meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time just base newts and cow
mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit to growing in cocoa is you
get to control all of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle, I don't know if it's a pro
or con, it dries up more quickly than soil
[SPEAKER_00]: so you may need to water more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that because that means I get to
feed more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the con to growing in cocoa,
it's not as forgiving as soil or a
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's acting more like hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make a mistake you're going to
see it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buffer to fix your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you overfeed in cocoa those plants
will show you right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into the last medium that I
have on my list to talk about and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool are those cubes that you see at
the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look like a giant sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are great for a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to dispose of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work very much like cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have any nutrients in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not hold any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a very nice wet and dry
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a very large variety of
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them in a one by one cube so
you can cut your clone into a little one
[SPEAKER_00]: by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also make them in a four by
four, a six by six, just about any size
[SPEAKER_00]: you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow a huge plant in a small
rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut your clone into a one inch
rockwool cube and then the four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: has a little spot where that one inch will
set right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the eight inch has a little slot
cut into it where that four by four fits
[SPEAKER_00]: right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just keep up potting just by
setting it on top of another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really saves a lot of work in a large
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably shouldn't forget that they
also offer cocoa in the same types of
[SPEAKER_00]: slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your clone into a small little
cocoa slab and then it fits right into a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger, which fits into a larger cocoa
slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not forget about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great for hydro type
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like that is
enough podcasting for one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about selecting containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about selecting your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we will talk about
selecting nutrients for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about it in depth on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that at patreon.com slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate your support there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in just a few days with a
fresh new episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Della Luna Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
See you next time.
