[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff and this is episode 594 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to talk about
failed breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to talk about nutrient
spiking toward the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to a few of the folks who support the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with the big Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend, Gramps Memel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout out to
Blackbird76.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a thank you shout out to
PacNorthwestDan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout out to Ned
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a special thank you shout
out to Matt H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast thank you shout out to Tartan
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to

[SPEAKER_00]: let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast thank you shout out to my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ziggy's Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it super easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of Patreon, Patreon was broken
for a couple of days and it kept telling
[SPEAKER_00]: me that I had 99 unread messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have caught up and answered all
of my Patreon messages at the time of this
[SPEAKER_00]: recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like I have not read your
message or answered your question,
[SPEAKER_00]: please resend your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a little reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a little nudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get your question on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon was tripping for a couple of days
and I'm trying to catch up and correct all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I missed you, please just reach out
again and I promise you I will get back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, also one more correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was listening to The Dude Grow's show
with Scotty Real, The Dude and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: Guru holding it down and Scotty Real did
mention that I got a lung infection from
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing soil with guano in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that was not me that that
happened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was commenting on somebody else's post
in a Facebook group which Scotty and I are
[SPEAKER_00]: both members of and somebody in that group
had a lung infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I commented, Scotty read it, saw my name,
I think he attached it to me and he said
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show that I had a lung infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who sent me the well wishes and
the words of encouragement for my lung
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, thank you, but that was not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went ahead and I mentally forwarded that
off to the person who needed the love and
[SPEAKER_00]: care because they do deserve some support
while they are sick, but it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to the community who sent me
messages and shout out to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's move forward with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I wanted to talk about some
plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more important topic to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is winter time here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cold as fuck out here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to not even say it,
but I'm just going to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold as fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so cold today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking across the kitchen and my
feet were freezing on the tile,
[SPEAKER_00]: had to get some socks and it made me think
of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to tell you guys to get your plants
off of the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter time, it is never a good
idea to have your plants on the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: ground on the cold floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ground is super cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: My toes, my feet were cold and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you've got plants on the floor
during the winter time, they are not happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to drink as much as they
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to eat as much as they
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't cycle the way that they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their metabolism won't function the way
that they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see funky coloring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see nutrient issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will look like you've got a pH problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start getting purple stems,
purple and goldish colored leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because your plants are simply too
damn cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may feel like the room is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relative humidity, the temperature may
be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your VPD may be dialed in, but feel the
temperature of that floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your bare hand on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your bare foot on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say, shit, that's cold,
your plants have been sitting there all
[SPEAKER_00]: day and haven't had a chance to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only colder during the dark
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's cold during your daytime cycle,
it is absolutely colder during the night
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light's not getting down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not penetrating the canopy enough to
warm up the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is always a good idea to get your
plants up off of that cold floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very common way is to just buy extra
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a three gallon pot,
get another three gallon pot, flip it
[SPEAKER_00]: upside down, set your plant right on top
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did just eat up about 10 to 12 inches
of your floor space of your ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: height, but the plants are now off of the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common way to correct this,
to remedy this is to just get a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will buy the four by four
botanic hair tray or the three by six
[SPEAKER_00]: tray, build a little cinder block table,
lift that up off the ground, put a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could drain all your water into
there, pull the bucket out, dump that
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to get the plants up
off the floor in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely recommend long sliding
greenhouse tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people simply use a pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will take a cinder block and
put the plants on a cinder block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever works for you will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got to go a little more
pricey just to keep the garden up for
[SPEAKER_00]: appearances, if that's what you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is get those plants up off
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pouring water into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting on the cold concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water gets super cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are getting pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wouldn't want to put your hand,
your feet, or maybe even your balls in
[SPEAKER_00]: that water or on that floor, don't do it
to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can't go put on some socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can't grab a pair of shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can't crank up the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to deal with what you give
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your baby's feet warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a failed breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great email here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Marco
Esquandolis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rye, Rye, Rocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, hey Rasta Jeff,
I never miss a podcast and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I really appreciate you listening to
every podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope you do more strain
specific episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to the show for a
while, you know that I do like to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight some of the strains that I have
bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of taken a break from that
because I've got so many Patreon messages
[SPEAKER_00]: and so much listener generated content
that it is more responsible of me to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than to simply advertise my brand and my
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it was more important for me to
help you than advertise my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a question about a specific
strain, I will do a strain report on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've held off on those for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple written.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to throw them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, it would also be really
cool to hear about one of your breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments that did not work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, I reversed a Leonardo and I
crossed a bunch of your strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the resulting crosses were no better
than the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are breeding, you do need to have
a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have some standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to improve upon cannabis when
we are breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just make seeds just to
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to make more reproduction
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got two sixes, you better make a
seven or an eight out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got two sixes, I hope you can make
a 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not how things work all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say the orangegasm to Leo
was strong, stable and frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a great gift for first time growers,
but once the growers get serious,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will get them more ivory originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be well and best wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my, and then he says my
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to call you Marco
Esquandolas because I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, Marco Esquandolas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run like an antelope, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some failed breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breeding for a long time and
I've put out, there are probably 50
[SPEAKER_00]: strains on my website right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably closer to 75 or a hundred
strains that you can read about that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have created that I have released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, if there are 75 on the
website, there are probably another 25 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 that I never even released.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably 10 or 15 that I threw
large batches of seeds away because,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, excuse me, I'm going to, do I edit
that or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a drink and keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are large batches of seeds that I
threw away because I did not feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants, those seeds, that breeding
project lived up to my expectations and it
[SPEAKER_00]: did not improve upon cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't move cannabis forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was a genetic dice roll,
I went backwards three steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't happy with the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took plant A and plant B and like I said
before, maybe they were both sevens or
[SPEAKER_00]: eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make nines and tens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came out with more sixes and sevens and
that's not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have thrown shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of those projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have talked about the lemon OG project
that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a sip of this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a clone of a lemon OG plant and I
loved that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a really nice balanced buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had a problem with it in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never got mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would clone very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could top it and it would make a bunch
of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could leave it un-topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd grow a big old giant glory bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be amazing to breed to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember which male I used at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed the lemon kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon OG kush got reversed is what I
did and I pollinated a bunch of shit with
[SPEAKER_00]: that lemon kush and everything that came
from there was complete garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the plants would grow with great
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would put on a bunch of weight,
big fat buds, but then when you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was zero, absolute zero buzz came
from any of the offspring from that lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: OG breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I pollinated two or three
different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked them and everybody went,
that tastes good and it smells good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not high at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, that was a failed
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we didn't take it to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could have been CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could have been CBTHCV, CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could have been a lot of other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't giving us the head buzz that we
were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The familiar stoned feeling you get when
you smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't getting any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like making you wish you
would have gotten stoned because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like smoking weed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd smoke it and just go, well,
my lungs burn and I cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a roach and there's smoke in
the air, but I don't feel shit from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a failed breeding project in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was looking for CBD, CBG,
THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, that was a failed
breeding experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't make cannabis go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and you're going to, a lot of
people are going to have a varying
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Night Nurse kind of sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released Night Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did a great job in testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I saw later on down the line that it
wasn't, I was seeing other phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: other plant structures that I didn't see
in testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we didn't test enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe new environments gave us new things,
but that's when I really started testing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit harder was when I saw that
Night Nurse wasn't what I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was cool for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was cool in a couple of local grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: She kicked ass in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw her go to other smaller grows,
it was when she went under LEDs and
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halides that Night Nurse
just, it wasn't a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I should not have put that
one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never make more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I gave the last bit of seeds away
just to have them gone and people know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like told them that plant's kind of
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, I want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that was not one of the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made King Kim Grape Stomper F2s and they
were fucking wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no uniformity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grew 10 seeds, you got 10 different
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a failed experiment in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to lock in certain traits of the
King Kim Grape Stomper OG and I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unleashed the beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking unlocked something to where
every single phenotype was wildly vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were tall skinny plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were tall fat plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were short skinny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were short fat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were sativa, crazy sativa looking
plants in that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were heavy, heavy indica plants in
that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you expect that in an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will expect variety, wild variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also see in an F2, you will see
where they strongly outperform the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of improved traits from
those, but they don't have the vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see different phenotypes,
but they start losing that vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So F2 showed a lot of wild traits that I
was not prepared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I abandoned that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not move forward with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we gonna talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred the grateful dog to platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds were big and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looked healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the seeds would germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a failure in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other seeds that came from that same round
of breeding all germinated just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all grew with great vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They harvested well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went on the website and got
advertised and sold, but the platinum OG
[SPEAKER_00]: to grateful dog was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get one sprout out of the entire
batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, that was a major
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole plant worth of seeds,
fucking nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding to the mac sometimes can be not a
hundred percent failure, but not a great
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I pollinate the mac, I've pollinated
the mac with a couple of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get very, very minimal, minimal seeds
from the mac pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I hit it with an Arise male,
if I hit it with King Solomon at just the
[SPEAKER_00]: right time, I can get some seeds out of
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten 25 seeds in one harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I tried, I got six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not 60, not 600, not 6,000, but six.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant next to it gave me about 2,000
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mac plant, I got six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, breeding with the mac
sometimes is not the best success,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a failure, but the offspring that
come from those good seeds are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that that is a complete
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, I reversed Golden Goat
and pollinated a headband cut with the
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed Golden Goat pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That headband plant that received the
pollen shriveled and died within two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other plants in the room were successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds made it to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sold the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, that headband plant was
like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shriveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shriveled up and it died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had that happen before,
and I didn't try it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured that that was a one-time thing,
and if it did that to me, I wasn't gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: waste my opportunity or my time or my
plants or my money or my space trying that
[SPEAKER_00]: project again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let that one go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some reversals completely suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes trying to reverse plants is a
pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants don't reverse well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when I treat a female plant with a
product that I make myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make my own silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply that to a plant in very specific
intervals, durations, and dilutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the words I'm looking
for, and most of the time I can create a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant that will produce pollen
sacs, and those pollen sacs are feminized,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can use that to make female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sometimes those reversals don't
make much pollen, if any pollen at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start spraying a female plant,
it'll react in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get multiple clones of the same
plant and treat them with different sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: and find out what works the best,
but sometimes I can't get those plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants just don't want to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give you a lot of pollen,
so sometimes the reversals are a pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing is really where I try to find all
of those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them myself most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being honest with you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper blueberry cookies,
I'm letting Tenasi get the very first
[SPEAKER_00]: testers out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are testing those for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got great faith in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to close friends and family
before they went out, so they got one
[SPEAKER_00]: round of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've passed that round of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going out to the public testers
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I know that the public is good with
those, then I will put them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the testing is what really reveals the
success or failure rate in a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can grow it, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the night nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what to expect from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The close group, they could grow it really
well when it got out to other lighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: other environments that wasn't as stellar
as I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the testing would have revealed that if
we had done more testing on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in turn caused me to step up my
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I test much more thoroughly now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've evolved a lot as a grower,
as a breeder, as a business person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my brief rant on failed
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had a lot of success, but for every
successful breeding project, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of failure behind it that
inspired me to do better, taught me how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do things more correctly, just moved me
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always going to be failures in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is kind of like a, it's a crap
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dice roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting a bunch of pieces together
and hoping that they land together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the ingredients here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the ingredients here,
but you don't get to pick exactly how much
[SPEAKER_00]: of each ingredient goes into the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we create a big bag of
bullshit and then it's our responsibility
[SPEAKER_00]: as a breeder to throw that bullshit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush it down the toilet, feed it to the
birds, maybe sprout the sprouts and eat
[SPEAKER_00]: the sprouts if you're into that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are not meant to be put in
anybody's cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of those, set yourself and your
fellow growers up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Marco Esquandolas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I answered that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for getting me ranting on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy breeding and talking about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Jason J in Northern
California and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a reference to another episode
when we were talking about weekly
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener does not flush on a weekly
basis in cocoa and let's see, did they say
[SPEAKER_00]: it cranks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cranks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, like you said, if you flush,
they miss a feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're in cocoa, they want every
feeding that you give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to flush and miss a
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you do flush, just flush the
pot by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drain the res and do all that mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can flush a plant and not even interrupt
its feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confused why people have trouble with
flushing or even do it at all mid grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why people flush mid grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people on social media say,
ah, I'm about to switch from veg to flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard should I flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's the end of my normal feeding week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are stopping the plants from eating
one solid meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get so many feedings for these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go, if there are nine weeks,
that's 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed them every day, that is 63
feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flush them once a week,
that is nine feedings they did not get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the math there for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not focused on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a percentage of feedings that you
did not get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is performance lost from your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't flush unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't flush excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't fuck anything up,
there's nothing to flush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says, my question is, I'm learning
more about PK spiking and calcium ramping
[SPEAKER_00]: in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident enough to know, to try these
techniques, but I could use a little
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance on when to spike PK and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I start spiking my PK if I
choose to do so?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, PK is phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say NPK a lot in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PK is phosphorus and potassium,
or is it potassium and phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was right the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never second guess yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have heard this talked about
much on any, I have not heard this talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about on any podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you can help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to try some soluble homemade
calcium inputs, chart some eggshells to
[SPEAKER_00]: their carbon form, dissolve in vinegar,
and eventually you have calcium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically there's a little more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you are my friend, but it says,
I love what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brother and keep it up from Jason J in
Northern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say California the first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I misread that and said,
uh, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Jay is in Northern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddies up North.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were warm because it's freaking
cold and snowy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably getting beat up up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here is about ramping up
and increasing phosphorus and potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and why would somebody want to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: As the flowering cycle goes on,
our plants don't want as much nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much nitrogen and the flower will make
your plants grow stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't get the bud set you're hoping
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to taper off the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In turn, we want to increase phosphorus
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what builds fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives us big, strong plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our listener, our friend Jason is
asking, when do I do this increase?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I start this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything too extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always kind of ramp up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go from like so many PPMs or EC of
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't double it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, just taper your way up,
slowly elevate, uh, work your way up until
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that the plants are showing you
that they've had enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to see that they're getting enough
nutrients is to look for what I call the
[SPEAKER_00]: nails getting done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tips of the leaves will look just like
they went to the manicurist and got the
[SPEAKER_00]: fingernails painted.
[SPEAKER_00]: See little leaf burn, little leaf burn,
little tips, little burns on the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that was a lot of words my brain
wouldn't put into a sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little burns on the leaf tips that look
like the fingernails got done are the
[SPEAKER_00]: first signs that you are pushing that
plant a little bit too hard with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see that you can either stick
with the amount of nutrients you are
[SPEAKER_00]: giving the plant because you're not
roasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not toasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pushing it right to the stressful
point, or you can dial back just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself, I like to see just a touch a new
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to push them right to the limit
until I see that little itty bitty sign
[SPEAKER_00]: of, Hey, that's a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they say, Hey, that's a little
bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, well, you're taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just keep giving it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give it to them at that strength
until the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taper up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about when to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase P and K slowly over weeks three
through seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to harvest a week nine,
you want to start flushing at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly ramp it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at week three, slowly ramp up until
week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe max out at week six and keep going
at week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe max out at week five, but see what
those plants want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal, have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just think you're going to go in
there and increase things and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start increasing your phosphorus
and potassium, you may also throw your Cal
[SPEAKER_00]: Mag out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to gently increase the
calcium and magnesium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the phosphorus or the potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium and Cal Mag will mess with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give one too much calcium,
it'll mess up your phosphorus uptake or
[SPEAKER_00]: your potassium uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give too much potassium,
it will mess with your Cal Mag uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to those ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly increase nutrients over weeks
three through seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right before you flush,
hit them with that winter frost one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll give you that last big fat dose of
NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should give you a big fat
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I keep saying, don't boost them
too hard right away because you will burn
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch the leaf tips for info.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf tips will tell you everything you
need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start getting crispy, then they're
getting burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing yellow splotches in
the middle, you may be overdoing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see little camouflage looking
patterns up here, you may be underdoing
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will give you all of the information
that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is something very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down either your EC or your PPMs of
your feeding solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are changing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a time to take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this goes well, you're going to want to
remember exactly what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this goes terribly wrong, you're going
to want to remember exactly what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down at week three, day 23,
I added this much NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this EC or this PPM, write down how
many milliliters of each bottle you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, this could go beautifully or
this could go terribly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it goes perfectly, you're going to
want to repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the notes written down,
you've got repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just follow that recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is to watch the
plants for feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them, watch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a reaction within 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know if those plants are happy or
angry with you very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, test your runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those plants are giving you real high
runoff numbers or real low runoff numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see if they are or are not
responding to the feedings, you can adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're giving you real high runoffs,
that means you've got too much nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're giving you real low runoff
numbers, you may be able to feed a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where are we from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about the, oh, this is going to
be very strain and very plant dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to watch each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that golden goat crosses,
you can NPK the shit out of them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you feed the, I'm not even going to
mention that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a plant in a commercial grow
that if we fed it too much at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would just go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't even grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would start growing in a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of growing one big bud,
it would just start putting little popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in a spiral up the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant sucked to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all very strain specific,
but slowly start increasing your
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium around week
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly build that up until week seven,
then hit it with the winter frost,
[SPEAKER_00]: then start flushing from there and you
should have excellent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the meters are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toys are great, but the plants are
always the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for that organic part of your
question, you said char up some eggshells
[SPEAKER_00]: to their carbon form, dissolve them in
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically you have calcium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to act like I know anything
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a bottled salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is not my realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to join us on embracing
organics and we can talk about making your
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium supplement from your vinegar and
egg shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the appropriate place for that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to blow you off, but I'm going to be
honest and say that's not my area,
[SPEAKER_00]: not my expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you bad advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on embracing organics Thursday
nights on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm in Colorado, so it is mountain
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in mountain time.
