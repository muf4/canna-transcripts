[SPEAKER_02]: A whole bunch of positive folks in that
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm proud of Lindsay also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Across the table, she just mouthed the
entire intro perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've nailed it two or three times now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_14]: I send you videos all the time of me
nailing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sent me a video of us face swapped
doing the video, and I almost had a
[SPEAKER_02]: nervous breakdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was creepy as fuck for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my favorite video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do some introductions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL.
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, that lovely voice
you just heard to the left of me is the
[SPEAKER_02]: dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to the show, honey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for driving all the way from
Colorado Springs to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to have any tech issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: No tech issues this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not take any gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it at the home studio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny brought an Easter basket filled
with turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody at the table got a gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are not at the table are going
to be here later got gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got green crack terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has got sleeping monkey hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some Panama punch on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some blue dream over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little conversation about the
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gifted a sweet new pencil dabber
from our friend Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a UV reactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's UV reactive on one end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has got a cobalt baby blue,
which is honestly one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: colors, if you know much about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tip has got some blue in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also already got a little piece of
hair in the reclaim that's stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how our lives are so hairy,
but that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Tater Glass and Granny for
hooking me up with this sweet new pencil
[SPEAKER_02]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it's one of my favorite colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's similar to my daughter's eyes
color, but honestly, that was one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite colors before she even was born.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I got to show you the UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny carries around a UV light,
you guys, so that if you've got UV
[SPEAKER_02]: reflective glass, it's a new reactive
glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much a black light,
but you hold the rig underneath this
[SPEAKER_02]: little light Granny's got, and if it's got
UV in there, Illuminati glass,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will glow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dope as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe she carries that around.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a literal Easter basket full of
treats.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Granny's basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny's basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out for coming all the way from
Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in front of me is a lovely traveling
stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Boo-Boo.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you you could be on the next one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over here, a quiet guy,
but he'll talk a couple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Bobo Blasterco, also known as Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: The traveling stoner's better half,
the one that keeps her in line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check keeper, check somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys follow Bobo Blasterco on
Instagram because he has started making
[SPEAKER_02]: glass gnome carb caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm starting to dabble in the glass game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you are a hell of an artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were a tattooist before I knew you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing art for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got that art thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do a lot of clay sculpting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So glass is kind of like second nature,
but it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good at it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you excelling quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Ricky's telling me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little homie gnomies he's making.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you just started a glass account.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out gnome, N-O-M-E glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gnome glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys follow him because he makes cool
glass, little gnome carb caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some cool ideas for him too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump in now while he's new and then you
can see him, see him get better and better
[SPEAKER_02]: and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that a gob of glass pendant you're
rocking there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that is dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gova?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I believe it's goba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you goba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's goba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say goba.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Joey.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's wearing a pendant that actually has
cannabis seeds inside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's got a little B on the
outside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're encapsulated little lemon cross
seeds.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one with a silver 99 seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the drips or the stuff on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the straight up penny with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are nice little like pinata
pendants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like worst comes to worst.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it breaks, you have like a present
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, it's bad luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's a good end of the world scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on a flight and you crash and
you're on an island, now you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I land on a fucking deserted island,
that's got some, a little bit of water
[SPEAKER_02]: nearby that I can take the salt out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got some soil that I can put some
salts into, but we can make this happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am never leaving the house without that
pendant again.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing, if it's got a hole in it,
because I'm pretty sure it's got a hole in
[SPEAKER_02]: it because the way that he makes his
glass, don't wear it in the shower because
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds will germinate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: For real?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all that moisture, the humidity in
the shower, you'll get water in there
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just takes a little tiny bit of
water to germinate some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be a warm place to actually
watch to see what it would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if it would somehow try to grow out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Joey, you got to send us
another one so that we can... We'll have a
[SPEAKER_08]: science project here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just get some seeds and put them in a
vial and poke a little hole in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll watch what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is cause for celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should all, I was going to say we
should all take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is the dad and granny's one year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been on social media one year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it quite amazing that you have come
this far in one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many Instagram followers have you got?
[SPEAKER_08]: This morning, it was 215,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you didn't hear the microphone
smack against my forehead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me do it a little harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 215,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes no sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: In one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an account with 19,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got deleted and now I'm almost back to
10,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would give myself credit for 25,000
followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got 10 times what I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not just... It's people from all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was doing the Periscope,
I did a gram dab for celebration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, watch me on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: You took a gram dab at around... It was
around 420 this afternoon, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the person came in from Russia
talking, you know, we're so glad Trump is
[SPEAKER_08]: the president.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if there would have been world
war, if Hillary were... And I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I know your leader really felt that way
and okay, but I think it's amazing that
[SPEAKER_08]: people from Russia come to watch the
dabbing granny dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you took a gram dab at 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is, 820 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're in damn good shape.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been dabbing since about six o'clock
this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw your video this morning when you
were talking about you were excited to
[SPEAKER_02]: come be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was early this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you replied to one of my
Instagram messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this lady can dab you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can keep up with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can probably out dab you.
[SPEAKER_02]: She probably has more Terps and better
Terps than you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: She showed up with the gifts too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't beat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one year, are you on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_08]: I am on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a huge following on YouTube,
but I have a very loyal following that
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like granny's reality TV.
[SPEAKER_08]: They ask a lot of questions about my
family and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they know that I've evolved and I don't
have an hour every morning to wait and
[SPEAKER_08]: bake.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I do a YouTube once a week,
they're happy to have my little presence
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just find it incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they find you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can my listeners find you just by
searching for dabbing granny?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's dabbing on most of my social
medias are dabbing underscore granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm on YouTube, Periscope, Instagram,
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know I'm liking Facebook again and
people are finding me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that live streaming and I like the
intimacy of Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Periscope, my room fills up pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple hundred people real quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook might be 10, 15 people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can have nice conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, the people on Facebook is
what I like better about the Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know more people on Periscope because
I've been doing it longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only have Facebook friends on my
Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly people that I know personally
that I've hung out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I go Facebook live, it's all my
bros, it's these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a one year dab right there
happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at my friend, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a nice chunky dab there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's throwing a carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's hitting the sweet rig from our
friends at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to our friend, Becca,
and everybody over at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the lovely Elevate dolls.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to share a secret about the
traveling stoner and I.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, Oh, what the hell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on my list of notes for breast cancer
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: The traveling stoner and I went and had
our nipples pierced.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was probably one of the most painful
things I've been through in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these lovely ladies went and got their
nipples pierced to raise awareness for
[SPEAKER_02]: breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, that is some dedication.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some badass women.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, this is truly, I didn't do
it for like, Oh, let's go get a tattoo or
[SPEAKER_08]: a piercing.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the way I thought about it because
I know some people that have breast cancer
[SPEAKER_08]: and I thought it's breast cancer awareness
month and somebody shared some stories
[SPEAKER_08]: with me and I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have breast cancer and you're going
through chemo, chemotherapy, God dang,
[SPEAKER_08]: life probably sucks and every day is a
battle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just having your mammogram done is an
uncomfortable experience for any woman.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just is.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go get your boob squished.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was like, come on, Lindsay,
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's a few minutes of pain compared to
someone?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they do it if you don't have a
boob?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're lacking in the boob region,
what do they squish?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they go for?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like for mammograms you mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I just took a weird turn on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, well, how do you?
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you were talking about for the
piercing for a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, it's not through the boob,
it's through the nipple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what you think we did,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're higher than me.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a long day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you know, I did not mean to throw
you off course that you were on a path.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't want to go get a tattoo or?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't want to get a tattoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really I didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will share something personal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been married to my husband for over
40 years, almost 45.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know my husband very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew he would not approve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of you would be like, Oh,
but wouldn't every man like their woman's
[SPEAKER_08]: nipples pierced?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: My husband is very conservative about your
body.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't tell him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knew I was hanging out with Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knew what was going on, but I did not
tell him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought if I tell him immediately,
he'll say, take him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I waited a few days and he knows how
bad a piercing hurts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is how I told him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was sitting in his chair and I had fun
band-aids, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_08]: Traveling stoner.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put on, I had little round sad face
emoji band-aids and this kind of graphic,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the round part fits over a woman's
areola perfectly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he was sitting in his chair and I
said, I have something to tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, Oh my God, I know you're not going
to like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, what did you do now?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I lifted my shirt and there was them
two sad faces looking at him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, you are not 25 years old,
like those kids you're hanging out with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, but it was to raise breast
cancer awareness.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, I don't want to hear your
rationalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't like it, but yeah,
it does look kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a win-win for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsay wouldn't let me give her a hug for
like a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't let anybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to sleep on the couch for a week.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every like the dogs and like even the,
the sheets would get you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, too fast, too fast.
[SPEAKER_14]: The other day I was putting on a onesie
really fast and I, I zipped it up and I
[SPEAKER_14]: was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Chris was like, Oh, I saw that,
that one hurt.
[SPEAKER_08]: My German shepherd jumped up on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a titty twister just when the left
one was almost healed and it was like 360.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might need a dab after all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were talking about periscope and
stuff, I was going to talk, I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: mention like, you put a lot of your life
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you like, don't you want to keep
anything to yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't even need to ask that
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: What have I really got to, you know,
secrets are bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means something dirty or,
or bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think anything I've done in my
life is really dirty or bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's been a learning experience
and I'll share it with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully you'll learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I, I was young and dumb once,
I did some stupid things that young and
[SPEAKER_08]: dumb people do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dumb, not dumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll share that with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you'll learn from the things I
say, because I do have a lot of experience
[SPEAKER_08]: behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find, well, being a podcaster and I also
used to put myself on periscope a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't seem to be, I don't like sitting
down as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to be on my feet doing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Periscope makes me feel like I get anxious
for some reason afterward.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on how much you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I look up and it's been like 20,
20 or 30 minutes and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only meant to spend five minutes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time does get away quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It flies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But putting that much of myself out,
I I'm accountable for what I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't fit it all because however many
listeners we're listening listened and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's on record and the pod, every episode
is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've said before, I'm going to start
putting on old episodes, even have you
[SPEAKER_08]: learned that the power of your words,
you really sometimes have to stop and
[SPEAKER_08]: think because people take things
literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really lucky that I had a starter
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had another friend that had kind of a
comedy slash community based podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys check out Wade really,
he's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of got to be his co-host.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to say a couple of dumb things on
episodes and realize, Oh, I can't say that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, you have to figure it out,
but that's how I learned was by fucking it
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was laughing when I said,
I'll try to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, the way I learn, I have to
fall and crash and I have to go,
[SPEAKER_02]: damn, that sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll try to learn from that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very accountable for the things I say,
because so many people do watch me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said something on your social
media this morning about when you become
[SPEAKER_02]: as known as you are, you way more than
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody at this table has a little
bit of notice, but you've got 10 times
[SPEAKER_02]: what we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get to your level of Insta
celebrity or Insta fame.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slightly Insta famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to pay attention to what you
say and who you talk to and what you
[SPEAKER_02]: share.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you get caught up in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier to get caught up in
shit when you've got 250,000 people in
[SPEAKER_02]: your ear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in our cannabis community alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in this small community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I catch myself in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I catch myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's choosing sides all the time in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like we're all just a bunch
of potheads having fun, but that's how it
[SPEAKER_08]: should be.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should all be united.
[SPEAKER_08]: There shouldn't be any backstabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't have time for pettiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting too old.
[SPEAKER_02]: These kids are too old for that shit too
already.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, I think all these young
people will learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't just, Jeff, maybe you said something
shitty about Bobo Blaster over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that was me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granny, you know, he's just a rotten
person.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm learning that some of these kids
will take what you said to heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobo Blaster over there might be damn good
person, but you have a personal vendetta
[SPEAKER_08]: because some girl you liked, he liked.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, she said bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm messing up his glass business and
taking money off of their table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just using you as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no beef ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless somebody's done me wrong,
you can, you can gossip and talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: somebody all you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rest assured, granny is not going to
listen to your bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always old enough and wise enough to
make my own decisions about people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You told me earlier that you just trust
your gut and you're 90% of the time you're
[SPEAKER_02]: right is what I think you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My gut usually is a pretty good judge of
what I shouldn't, shouldn't do with other
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Lindsey's the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secrets don't make friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, what's happening over there?
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just asking to be heat of the nail
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually passed me a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to grab the email here and
I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of hash did you just give me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Terp Slurpee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Terp Slurpee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these, these lovely ladies,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they called it Terp Slurpee.
[SPEAKER_02]: These lovely ladies, the dabbing granny
and the lovely traveling stoner here,
[SPEAKER_02]: they came because they are going to do a
food drive slash new toy drive,
[SPEAKER_02]: new toys, you guys, new toys in packages
for kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you an age range.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let these ladies handle it while I
take this dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But would one of you ladies like to tell
me all about your food and toy drive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk for a while, Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, we have set up a food and toy
drive here in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_14]: So far we have 17 different places as drop
off points.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, at each of those locations,
you'll be able to get some sort of special
[SPEAKER_14]: like deal or offer something for bringing
in either a canned food, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_14]: a non-expired canned food or
non-perishable canned food.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something y'all would eat.
[SPEAKER_08]: No expired garbanzo beans.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you like garbanzo beans,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, or like Jeff said, a brand new toy in
a packaging, um, any age range,
[SPEAKER_14]: honestly, we don't, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, a toy is a toy.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not gonna, we're not gonna put a
limit on it like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but yeah, if you bring in an item to
one of the, one of the places that we'll
[SPEAKER_14]: list off, um, you can get a, and each
place is doing something different.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, you'll have to ask the specific
place what they're going to, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, do for it, but we will,
we'll have a flyer and everything for it
[SPEAKER_14]: that we'll be posting and stuff with each
place that we have.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have 17 places right now confirmed
and we have three spots open for places.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We decided to keep it at 20 cause we are
going to be the ones that will be going by
[SPEAKER_08]: the dispensaries, picking stuff up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I have a warehouse to store things in
until we distribute them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we picked a good organization.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we, we wanted, we wanted to
somehow keep it in the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_08]: but this year on such short notice,
that's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we have decided to do is I got
into contact with the Marion house and the
[SPEAKER_08]: Marion house is down on Bijou and they
feed and they clothe a lot of our homeless
[SPEAKER_08]: community.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, that's a lot of veterans and
it's also a lot of young people moving
[SPEAKER_08]: here because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you see a lot of young people down
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I reached out to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be happy to take anything we
have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's second organization that
under the Marion house is called the
[SPEAKER_08]: family resource center.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they deal with families that are
totally displaced, homeless families that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're getting set up in apartments and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are why we're saying we'll take
toys because there's children involved in
[SPEAKER_08]: most of these cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why we decided, you know,
so many people think, Oh, people that
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke cannabis, they're bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love giving back to our community.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we want to start small this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just want to do it in Colorado Springs,
but we're hoping to have a really big
[SPEAKER_14]: turnout this year and be able to make it
into something even bigger for next year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether that means we stay in the Springs
and just make it bigger next year,
[SPEAKER_14]: or we, you know, try to do something even
bigger.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but we're really excited about this
and the different place.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to list off the different
places that we have?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to throw one more thing in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we'd, at first we were just going to
do, we, we had talked about money and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff and we decided no, but what we are
going to do all the different places that
[SPEAKER_08]: the 20 places we're going to put a gallon
mason jar there and you can drop off gift
[SPEAKER_08]: certificates because like I say,
the family resource center, um,
[SPEAKER_08]: say we get enough, a meal together,
we get everything for their, and this is
[SPEAKER_08]: for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_08]: We get their Christmas meal together.
[SPEAKER_08]: What if they don't have a roasting pan?
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: The family resource center can say,
here, take this gift certificate,
[SPEAKER_08]: go get what else you need for,
or I think the other thing we might want
[SPEAKER_08]: to include is diapers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, diapers are really, really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we could expand, you know,
the toy, diaper and food.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay's looking at me like, God,
we didn't discuss this.
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as we're doing good things,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen, anything that's not like expired
or bad or something we really couldn't
[SPEAKER_14]: donate, like, don't be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't bring us like, you know,
go get, go to the health food store and
[SPEAKER_02]: get some of that Amy's organic chili,
get some soups, shit that people want to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat, like something that you can actually
open and consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of like some green beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can do that, but who wants
fucking green beans for dinner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get some soup, some Campbell's good
shit, some chunky shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some, yeah, I'm a vegetarian,
so I'm going to get some of that fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: veggie soup, but go get the meaty soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are, we got to feed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then those gift certificates can be
used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're just doing non-perishables,
but you need milk.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need butter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need eggs.
[SPEAKER_08]: A Walmart gift card.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where that's going to come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we had more time, we could probably
solicit grocery stores and stuff for
[SPEAKER_08]: turkeys, but this year, not this year,
but next year guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to make it really,
really huge.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you prefer them rap or not rap the
gifts for the kids?
[SPEAKER_08]: I say not rap.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll let the family resource center do
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll do this and then turn it
over to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wrap them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you want to donate wrapping
papers so that they can be wrapped,
[SPEAKER_02]: go for that, but don't wrap them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of said that because I want to see
what's in there so that I make sure you're
[SPEAKER_08]: not giving these kids a box of dicks or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And besides that, how do you know that
there's not a used toy wrapped up?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because unfortunately, I would love to
think that we're all honest, but we're
[SPEAKER_08]: not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody out there is not honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a really horrible prank.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to distribute the boxes next
Friday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that correct, Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next Friday, wasn't that our timeframe?
[SPEAKER_08]: We were going to put them out next Friday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collection boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, what will the day be on that
Friday?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is... Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had done fucked up and asked the same
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.
What?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's next Friday?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the 18th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the drop off no later than December
16th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just making notes because I want to
make sure that this podcast comes out at
[SPEAKER_02]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put this out on the 17th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I run down the drop off?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're thinking about... We haven't
fine tuned this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still kind of work on it,
but we're thinking we could make this into
[SPEAKER_08]: a little competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the drop off spots, one of them
being Elevate, already said, well,
[SPEAKER_08]: how about if every place put a little gift
in there?
[SPEAKER_08]: She said, I'll throw something in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the end, the person that
collected the most gets the little prize
[SPEAKER_08]: package from the 20 drop off spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: And granny goes and spends a day with them
doing something fun at their facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could turn this into a fun competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could win a date with granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some of the dispensaries are going
to go penny pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there's already some specials.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll go through the people we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Lindsay said, there's only three
spots left.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to fill one of the last
three spots, I guess... Got to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have a place where you can
collect canned foods, a high traffic area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be able to participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the cannabis community and be proud
of the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got any fear or hatred toward
the cannabis community, please don't
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to this ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're not going to junk up your
facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you call and say the box is full,
somebody will be there to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And your lobby or wherever you have the
box will not be an eyesore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise you that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a win-win situation because you
get, you get free publicity on my social
[SPEAKER_08]: media.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things I was going to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be okay with granny
publicizing your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your facility, your store, wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a head shop, if it's a grow store,
if it's a dispensary, if it's a glass
[SPEAKER_02]: shop, I think I said head shop,
but I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might not have... Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere that cannabis consumers or
counterculture folk, millennials may roam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coffee shop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm down for anything as long as you're
cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I bet you by the time this comes
out, you'll have your three slots filled
[SPEAKER_02]: because you are a, you're a networking
young lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what I seem to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A higher elevation has got to be on your
list.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me run down the list.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear the 17.
[SPEAKER_08]: Glass grinds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're located down on the south
end of town, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere off Fillmore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then of course the traveling stoners place
a business green and healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're over on old Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: The weed pimps.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're fun guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_08]: They make me laugh every time I see them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Elevate and hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a box at both locations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one down on the circle.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have one up on Academy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Both stores will have a box.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow Life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Natural Mystics Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're downtown.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Joey?
[SPEAKER_08]: DBK Glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: The family joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dankery.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a new dispan... Can I tell you
something funny about the Dankery?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's funny and not derogatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not at all derogatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I once managed a nonprofit on a
military installation in Colorado Springs
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was let go because of Dab and
Granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody there ever talks to me anymore
because I smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made new friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I met... Well, my life has gotten much
better.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I liked what I did, but box next.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran into the Dankery just because it was
a new dispensary and I was with one of my
[SPEAKER_08]: friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: They took a picture because they were very
happy to see the Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my former volunteers because I was
a volunteer organization got in touch with
[SPEAKER_08]: me and said, Gail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gail is my real name.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were at my son's dispensary today.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, in almost a year, you're the
first person that has reached out to talk
[SPEAKER_08]: to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she was very happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at the Dankery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks that people just shunned you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but look at the great friends I've
made.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've replaced them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way better company.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Truthfully, people, somebody asked me in
one of my comments today, they said,
[SPEAKER_08]: did you ever think at your age,
you would be this important person in the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, no, I pinch myself every
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, how can this be?
[SPEAKER_08]: How can this be?
[SPEAKER_08]: I embrace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No security clearance to get in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you do to Lindsay, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: She got her own dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: She set herself up.
[SPEAKER_06]: She heat her own nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she in there puking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she's puking, but I can hear
her coughing through the walls.
[SPEAKER_06]: She went on a coughing fit and I don't
think she tried to hold it for the mics to
[SPEAKER_06]: not like die in this room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked about you earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did your ears ring?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause Chris said, I watched you do that
dab and you just kept going in and you
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't cough.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so mesmerizing watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, you have Jeff to thank for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if you know this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might've been the first time we
met at the first podcast and we talked
[SPEAKER_08]: about coughing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you said, well, I very rarely cough
because you own your lungs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell them what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I feel that tickle and you all
know what I mean when I say I feel that
[SPEAKER_08]: tickle, I hear your voice in my head and I
almost meditate with my eyes open that I
[SPEAKER_08]: am not going to cough.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never talked about this on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only told like four people in my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: This granny was one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take giant dab to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you feel like you're going to cough,
when you feel that thing that goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you blow out the dab and you start to
go, do you feel that shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're, when you're walking at the
mall, if you get a little cramped,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, you know, just fucking fall
down and start spams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you do, I'm sorry, but you've got
a condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't just fall down and
fucking spams out like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was for just a second, but most normal
folk, they, if you get a cramp,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't just fucking fall down and spazz
out in the middle of the mall.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, that's what my lungs are
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're throwing a fit like a fucking mad
child to cramp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I feel that cough coming and I either
inhale or exhale as hard as I can distract
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, like when your dog's trying to
run away at a cat, you just pull the leash
[SPEAKER_02]: and put a treat in front of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It forgets about the cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks at the tree and goes,
Oh, treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just breathe in real hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lungs like air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just suck that in instead of
trying to cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's a good for me or
bad for me, but it works, but it's gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: be better than coughing so hard and
blowing out my face and getting red eyed
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've coughed so hard, blown up fucking
blood vessel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get ads when I do cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I do those little cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a shit cough, but I don't let
those, those dead, dead core exercise.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every now and again, I've smoked strange
product and get wet lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, pho, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke pho, I know that sounds weird
to a lot of people in random places,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that you can make quality cannabis
concentrates with propane if you do it
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it comes out, uh, like live resident
comes out really moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do when I smoke it, my lungs feel heavy
and I spit up all cough up the next
[SPEAKER_02]: morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll cough up a bright green or a bright
yellow golf golf.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you're sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I need, but once it comes out,
I'm marvelous, but it's wet in your lungs
[SPEAKER_08]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we should finish our list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to keep you on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 80 hashtag.
[SPEAKER_08]: They like it when we ramble back to as,
as you always say, let's get back to the
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, new age medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're out by garden of the gods.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Bailey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to new age medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rocky mountain dabber.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tweedleaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tweedleaf is really, um, I'm glad they're
on board cause they actually once a month
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to do a charity event.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody seemed to want cannabis money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hard part about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found, uh, grow for vets finally took
money, but it was really, really hard to
[SPEAKER_08]: find.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody that will take cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vets always need help and it's always
great to help the vets and they'll take
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you ever need some more to send
stuff, I've got a guy who runs a veteran
[SPEAKER_02]: organization that will always need
contributions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, she asked me again, can we do once
one Saturday a month where 10% of
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody's purchase goes directly to a
charity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to Renee at Tweedleaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty nice dispensary too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's not, it's not yours actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even that I don't, but you do
know one thing about me is that that sense
[SPEAKER_08]: of loyalty I have.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, I go to other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do primarily shop at green and healthy,
but I visit other dispensaries and I go
[SPEAKER_14]: into other places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they don't grow every strand in the
world.
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, like I like to go to other
places.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, I just have to, I cannot go to one
dispensary because of the different drops
[SPEAKER_08]: and I, and y'all know I've developed great
taste buds for different product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was complimenting you earlier on your,
your ability to shop everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: That I can recognize concentrates by their
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of get around in a good way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoy being able to tell people,
you know, this is really good product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go spend your X amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day in the late afternoon around two
30, three o'clock, you can open up
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram and see where granny decided to
shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, there's one or two shots of her and
the cool bud tender there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would treat her politely.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always a shot of me on somebody's
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pop up somewhere random,
I'm like, oh, she's at, I can almost tell
[SPEAKER_02]: where you are like, oh, she went to
elevate and then she had this little,
[SPEAKER_02]: then she took, yeah, she took grumpy
grandpa somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she went to the glass grind.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Altitude meds.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're downtown, I believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several locations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, wherever they are, we're going to
have boxes and all their locations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Emerald city wellness.
[SPEAKER_08]: The pink house and stained glass LLC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that leaves three spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get in touch with me, DM me on Instagram,
dabbing underscore granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think those spots will fill up quickly
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you'll probably have those filled.
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes out in like seven or 10 days
from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these seven, 10 is a probably be filled
up hopefully with much faith.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we need now is people to go to these
locations with a non-perishable can good
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would eat you guys that you would
put in a pan and heat up yourself and sit
[SPEAKER_02]: down and fucking enjoy like a meal by
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It don't bring us a bunch of random side
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to feed some people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you're not a big shopper.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what that mason jar is going to be
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis community is the most
honorable community.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can drop your money in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will get it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can leave your badge or your ID behind
because we're all stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we drop some shit, we hope that
you're going to hand it to me also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I've just been lucky, but I hear
it's pretty, pretty often that people
[SPEAKER_08]: always get back their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: With that said though, if you're broke and
all you have in your cabinet is something
[SPEAKER_14]: and all you want to bring, you want to
bring something in like, we will take that
[SPEAKER_02]: cream corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those don't feel like you can participate.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't feel like we're sitting here
and saying, don't bring anything in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like if, you know, like believe me,
I've been there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was in college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only steak and lobster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing but steak and lobster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't bring that, but that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only steak and lobster and live residence.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just sitting there thinking like,
oh God, three years ago I would have been
[SPEAKER_14]: like, well shit, I'm not bringing anything
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to feed some people.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might've been one of the people that
hopefully was benefiting from our little
[SPEAKER_08]: food drive.
[SPEAKER_14]: The college one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people unfortunately are right at
that line where they don't, need the help,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they can't afford to give any help.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like where most folks are right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Making crucial decisions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I need this or do we want to eat at the
end of the week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to wipe my ass or get high
this week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's kind of time to decide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can walk to work, not get gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's figure this out.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_14]: What can we give up?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you just gave me a sinking feeling of
recreation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you said Medicaid or wipe your butt,
I'm afraid that's what Californians are
[SPEAKER_08]: facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to stay out of a lot of the
California stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see both sides of it and I try to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Colorado, we did all the things right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought that we had lost an initiative
here in Pueblo and they are recounting and
[SPEAKER_02]: still counting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that we may have actually
won three of the four major cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: initiatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may actually get to open recreational
cannabis facilities within the city limits
[SPEAKER_02]: of Pueblo before too long here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want a new job, that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll both go work in a new dispenser and
be bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be so much fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did white Mike have anything to do with
this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was he quite the activist for all the
things that were going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mike did a lot of groundwork and a
lot of internet work and a lot of podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you want to give Mike a shout
out, he might appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only met him once, but yeah,
shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I listened to your podcast where I
gained so much knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've listened to Mike and even though
I've met him one time in person where he
[SPEAKER_08]: was so quiet, he's not that way on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's quiet until he gets a read on you and
knows how much of him you want to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he gave you enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was, yeah, he was taught to speak
when spoken to and shut the fuck up when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's time to shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's very knowledgeable about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Continue the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lucky to have such a good team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've got growers and we've got
activists and we've got city council
[SPEAKER_02]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got glass makers so that we can
consume our products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Lindsay over here promoting us
and keeping us medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that meant, but that was
a bubble fish face.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be time to start trolling Lindsay
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were throwing up from your
dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: I took it way too hot.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't even that it was a big dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, she got her own dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: She hit her own nail.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even remember what I grabbed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I had actually forgotten it was
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the dab was fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was after I sat here for a second,
I was like, Ooh, that was really frigging
[SPEAKER_14]: hot.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, that really hurt my chest.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to
cough for a while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can Mike it up in here and you can
cough like Mike on the podcast for 10
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just reach over and turn Mike's
microphone down when he starts doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gives me the, he points down and I'm
like, I got you bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn that down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what friends are for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a canned food drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toys also guys, toys are rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring some toys, some Ninja turtles or
some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, something that you'd want to play
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you don't all have a bunch of
extra money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this will end the drop off date will
end December 10th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got nearly a month from the time
that this episode comes out, pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: December 16th, December 6th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't read my own damn writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a six.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will correct that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I cut my finger a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We figured if we picked it up then,
you know, that's a week before Christmas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it to these folks over the weekend and
they can distribute it that week of
[SPEAKER_08]: Christmas.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make some happy kids, make some bellies
happy, make some folks happy, brighten up
[SPEAKER_02]: some holidays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, whatever holiday you celebrate,
share some, share some joy, help some
[SPEAKER_02]: people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winter gets cold and shitty here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the cold, the snow, the slowness,
the fucking that vibe makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sad anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got a shitty Christmas on top
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not doing well, it really fucks
things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got kids on top of that,
that's just the icing on the damn poor
[SPEAKER_02]: cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it helps some people out, make them,
make them have a little, little better
[SPEAKER_08]: kids don't know any different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you, if you don't break them early,
they get a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's try to, try to help them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, you don't want to raise
strippers and serial killers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny turned red and blushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never seen granny blush before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Andrew, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote down just a one word note and I'm
probably gonna wait till you get done
[SPEAKER_02]: taking that drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't want you to spread all over
the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or all over me or all over Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she's looking right at you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I was like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new trend in cannabis that I have been
catching on to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the suppositories.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to, let's, let's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: May I steal some of your green crack tabs
to place on my turps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is going to do me just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This green crack turps on the,
uh, what kind of shatter do I has?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Black Cherry Maduro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I first heard about them,
damn suppositories.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even I was kind of skeptical, but I have a
pretty sick husband.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought, okay, this is really going
to help weaning them off the morphine and
[SPEAKER_08]: all that with this pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I have discovered is most,
most of you men are homophobic.
[SPEAKER_08]: You met, you mentioned suppositories and I
see you visibly squeezing your butt cheeks
[SPEAKER_08]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_08]: Women on the other hand, you know,
we spit 10 pound babies out our vaginas.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's a suppository?
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay's not me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't, we don't do that over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took these home for my husband and I was
like, look what I brought you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're 50% THC, 50% um, CBDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a brain fart and he said,
can you stick that up your ass?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is at least 12 hours of euphoria is the
best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can function.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not intoxicated, but you're
euphoric.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used one the night we had our girls
taken care of and it eased the pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my thought was, all right, now these
things are really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are truly a medical patient,
for real, if you're, especially cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: patient, if you're vomiting, right,
skip that whole part of the body.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you and I know that the divine creator
did not make our lungs to ingest
[SPEAKER_08]: irritants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of us like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know it's really not the best way to
medicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: No offense or butts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to smoke though.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you truly need to medicate,
there are so many membranes in your anus
[SPEAKER_08]: using these suppositories is a wonderful
way to medicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis isn't the first medicine they've
used as a suppository.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the newest and it's just on
our realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's what we're talking about now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been used for, I'm going to say
hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not certain, but I'm sure people have
been boofing things for way longer than
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the best way to medicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next week we'll skip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I stick one up my butt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I stuck a couple of them up my butt by
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: My husband had to have a colonoscopy the
next week and he came home.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's out grumpy.
[SPEAKER_08]: After his colonoscopy he was in pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was grouchy and I was like,
your butthole is already stretched out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try one of them suppositories.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: If he, I'm so glad he does not listen to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: He tried one and he was like, you're
right.
[SPEAKER_08]: My lower back pain is gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel the nauseousness in my belly
that I feel when I take a morphine for
[SPEAKER_08]: pain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm swimming from that dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might've put a little too much Terps,
but I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pure green crack distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like 96% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put a little line across the dab
and it made my brain swim around in my
[SPEAKER_02]: head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I tell the story about the green
crack?
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we're talking about it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're smoking on this stuff called green
crack, which is a pretty sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_08]: strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't you all agree?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not a real sativa person,
but I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you buy this, um, distilled hash,
it's solventless.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes in a little syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not very big.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a very small part where the
medicine actually comes out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: syringe, like where a needle would be,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no needle on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word syringe scares the shit out of
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, we don't want to say it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's literally just a glass syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like maybe if you have children,
you've used them for pulling up a
[SPEAKER_08]: Moxacillin or an antibiotic to give to
your baby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you have pets, you've used them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say it'd be good to feed a
baby bird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a really good description to
put the idea in people's heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be perfect to feed a baby bird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you had rodents or mice or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really do like these suppositories
for medicating.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to say where,
but a budtender said, well, have you tried
[SPEAKER_08]: that hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, well, you should try that green
crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he only asked, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went home.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was bouncing off the wall.
[SPEAKER_14]: She squirted the whole gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I went back to that budtender,
I was like, my God, I was bouncing off the
[SPEAKER_08]: walls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I had consumed huge amounts of
caffeine and lots of other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, granny, you didn't do the
whole gram, did you?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably about somewhere between 800
and 900 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_08]: Word from granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't try that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like when I did all those edibles
after the secret session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure you don't have to
discourage too many people sticking too
[SPEAKER_02]: much hash in their ass on this show.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if they were to try it, how much of I
really wouldn't suggest doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that product's made for
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The suppositories, however, would you do
that again?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do them regularly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've given some to the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can ask her what her effect was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched her put her head down in
blushes.
Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she can't be like, oh gosh,
she's putting me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about true medication.
[SPEAKER_14]: The first time I ever did one,
I actually did the fouria ones.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I had gotten the fouria ones as a
sample so long ago and I never used them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then once Gail started doing them,
was talking about them, I was supposed to
[SPEAKER_14]: go to Denver and meet up with one of our
friends for her birthday.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was in a lot of pain that morning
and I was like, shit, I really need to go
[SPEAKER_14]: to Denver.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, we have plans and I really
can't let this like fuck up our birth
[SPEAKER_14]: plan, you know, plans for her birthday.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I said to Chris, I'm like, I don't know
what to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, you need to put one of those
suppositories in and just try it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The first time I ever took one,
the fouria ones are a lot stronger.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like the 50 50 ones.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first time I ever took it,
I was like Gumby.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, I think because I was in a
lot of pain, like I just like immediately
[SPEAKER_14]: was out of pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was weird, but yeah, like you can ask
Chris.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, I couldn't really move my
lower half and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I don't even feel my lower
half.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it took care of all that female pain
you were having.
[SPEAKER_08]: True, true medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it take to kick in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, about 15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny gave me some drops, some oral
sublingual drops today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt those within like 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're, they're pretty good for a
tincture because a lot of tinctures are
[SPEAKER_08]: very ashy medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, it was a very clean,
almost like a green tea, but very light
[SPEAKER_02]: diluted green tea flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Lindsay was kind enough to throw
me some of a pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pumpkin spice, the white girl,
Incredibles edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious and they're kicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all working now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so proud of you that you jumped back
on the edible bag bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just needed to clean out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to kind of flush the edible system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've tallied I ate 5,200 milligrams of
edibles the Sunday after the secret
[SPEAKER_08]: session we were at.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Max's bacon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his grill.
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 pieces, Granny ate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, Granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kept going?
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate two cookies that were about 500
milligrams each, those lemon ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I didn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate two cupcakes at this traveling
store.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, what were those?
[SPEAKER_08]: 150?
[SPEAKER_08]: What were the cupcakes?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even remember those.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strawberry pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cupcakes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was a different sesh.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God, stop Jeff, because those were
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those ones you had gotten, we got the half
dozen of the solventless, pretty fancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the donuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I say?
[SPEAKER_14]: Cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's immediately what I thought
of.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so at the second secret sesh ever in
Colorado, it was in May.
[SPEAKER_14]: You were in Florida.
[SPEAKER_14]: You weren't here for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, you had literally flown out the
day before.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's looking like I know the cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: He saw pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he looks like he ate the donuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he knows the donuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, those strawberry lemonade
cupcakes from secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was so funny because Jeff and I
both, when I walked in, I was like,
[SPEAKER_14]: we both looked at each other and we're
like, we're not going to eat edibles.
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I found Jeff in the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had he already consumed edibles?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Hill brought me on stage and gave me
a two gram dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then asked, did he do one with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he, we kind of fixed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, he knows that I like to take big dabs
and we're buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was on stage and he goes,
I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's his thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes to say, I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my Adam Hill impersonation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he grabs his shirt, like he's
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pointed out and I go, no,
you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm taller than him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're much taller than him.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm always higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think even I was taller than Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've got a really killer picture of
the two of you on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were talking and you didn't know
I was taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought there's two of my favorite
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a picture of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Adam calls me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, Jeff, I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so fucking yeah, that's my Adam Hill
impersonation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, it's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just pull your nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he comes up and he's like, you think
you could take a big dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I can do a big dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, you ready for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And stretches out two grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, ah, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that's what was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he heated the nail to where it was
white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, let it cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, Nope, just hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, let it cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like hesitated like as long as I
could.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I just went in cause he was
pushing it on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pulled the whole thing and then I
blew it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, damn, this guy's a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone's like, can you do a bigger
dab than him?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people like, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would come up on stage and we would
dab together.
[SPEAKER_08]: You kept dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't finish their dabs and I
would grab the rig from them and then I
[SPEAKER_02]: would finish their dab for them and set
the rig down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, that only lasted for one
set.
[SPEAKER_02]: He calls it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam does like a little 45 minute things
and then goes and takes a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walks around the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to go sit upstairs and eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't real food there at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ate about 12 bags of chips in like
seven bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine so.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really high.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I didn't want to do a day,
a gram dab in that relay thing we were in,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I wanted to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Max heated up.
[SPEAKER_08]: My nail and he's like, let it cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, no, no, I want to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to hit it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to hit it out.
Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go a little hotter than a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot dabs aren't too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to actually move the nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not lying because I sat down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sitting right in front of the email.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at the other end of the table and I
was like, is that email that hot?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But everybody's email is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, it's really not as high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can keep my hand there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And guys, when you do big dabs like,
like Jeff and I do the traveling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You definitely watch the email struggle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you start, you start dropping it
and you see the temperature dropping right
[SPEAKER_02]: with your.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll, I hear some of the time I can
hear my dab hardening up on the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like, it's like, I can't keep
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to either suck harder or slower or
turning this thing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad monkey.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the wheels in your sky turning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went from suppositories to this really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that escalated that way,
but I'm really glad that it did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you finish your story about
suppositories?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got Gumby.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was Gumby and it solved her woman
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a much better day.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now you've figured out a better dosage
haven't you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I mean, we've got the smaller ones
now and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need the big ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to a hundred hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you are going to a hundred
milligrams of THC and a hundred milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: of CBD and a suppository.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred milligrams of edibles is of THC
is enough for most people to orally
[SPEAKER_02]: consume and be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't get like, Ooh, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, Ooh, I'm high off of a
hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I eat a hundred milligrams and then
take dabs like normal, then I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm high now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like right now I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I eat edibles also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but if just that amount of edibles
wouldn't have done it, but the two like
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, it's like a turbo makes your high
turbo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just gives you a little boost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm not like a scientist,
but I pay attention to the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about physical stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how quickly your bum is going to
absorb that much medicine and you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to absorb all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to poop any of it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your stomach's not going to destroy any of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your liver and kidneys aren't going to
ruin it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to suck all up into you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, when I do try that high of a dosage
that will be, you know, for me,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's going to be even high for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to test it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you Facebook live it after,
after you've got it inserted and hands
[SPEAKER_02]: washed?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll even put on my new outfit that the
lady from U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: 420 bought me as a gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have so many cool friends to give you
so many cool gifts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you sit here, you know me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I very girly girly?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a very nice gift, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you call yourself on the last podcast
an Iowa corn whore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what she gave me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am an Iowa corn whore.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what she gave me?
[SPEAKER_08]: A gift bag from Victoria's secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it goes with the new people rings.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it wasn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked at it and I was like,
really?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's yoga pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a thing that says U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: Army and gold sequins.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to pull you back to their team.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just the Victoria's secrets.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, you're a jeans and t-shirt
panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I told Tater that he is, I said,
I've never been in the Victoria's secrets.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what he said?
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I've been in many,
many of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you say that too, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've totally been there.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is my thought on Victoria's
secrets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Truthfully.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're very expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: And naked always worked for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why do you need these fancy thongs and
shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to pull that shit off
anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're strutting around in your
heels of baby, you just don't need that
[SPEAKER_08]: shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather buy medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I wish you could have seen the
animation that went along with the boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dropped my pen and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything went wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Relax over there, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So granny gets tons of great gifts is
something I mentioned, but she's,
[SPEAKER_02]: she's a karmic gift person.
[SPEAKER_02]: She brought me, I've got a frisbee that is
full of other gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, so she's, she's a good car.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't just get gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does give them back.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's always, always got a basket full of
candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you take dabs and you're sitting
there looking like you're depleted,
[SPEAKER_02]: she's like, you want some milk duds?
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I bring me milk chocolate suckers
tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To drop into the, to the hot chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, let's recap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like everybody's high.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a quick recap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a year on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems to like my silliness and
quirkiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, I'm always on the lookout
for fun hats and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I have found for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all are going to love follow her on
social media so that you can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, uh, periscope and Facebook live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she does a lot of stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She smokes down.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new app that I've been on toke
with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and this is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it's just people in the cannabis
community and what the end goal of this
[SPEAKER_08]: app is they want to be able to have
multi-cam users.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wouldn't just be you sitting there
watching me smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us would be interacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like a tiny chat sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm kind of helping them promote this
app.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw toke with, and I actually
assumed that it was a pothead dating
[SPEAKER_02]: service.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was the green tinder.
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that getting high with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there really one of those?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like grinder or tinder or grinder is for
gay dudes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, then we don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you, if you need grinder,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to discriminate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pass me my phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I got it in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you looking for the cannabis
dating service?
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, I just mouthed him like,
yo, hand me my phone.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, Oh, Jeff's like, Oh,
Lindsay just wants for the hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're going to give them a free
ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's basically a hookup app
for potheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys go check that one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you will not find me on that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am done as fuck with all that dating app
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three strikes, you're out motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_13]: Done did me wrong three times.
[SPEAKER_13]: Brought me three bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Change the subject before I put this pen
in my eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to shout them guys out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause they make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the pot brothers at law.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're out California.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Mark and Craig.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think their last name is Wasser.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a 25 word script, which I will
give you their business card to put in
[SPEAKER_08]: your wallet that there's the 25 word
script.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's basically the cops says,
where you been?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to discuss where I've been.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to tell you where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end, their hashtag is shut the
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're done, you shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've sent me their hashtag hat and I
wear it and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people know what senior hashtag STF
you have from my friends, the pot brothers
[SPEAKER_02]: at law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they could be was slaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call them eight five five
was slaw, but I think was law is more
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate, but check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop brothers at law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have funny social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was somebody else that we were
saying that we needed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it August house?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it my email?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we've got to give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually they are going to be working
with the family joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is, he, he's from, uh, Lee,
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is made here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a really nice email.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a big email fan, but it's got led
lights, um, really, really nice quartz
[SPEAKER_08]: banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wrapped from the bottom up,
consistent keeps your nail consistently
[SPEAKER_08]: hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You told me it was pro, uh, programmable
by your phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to have a smart phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called, it's called the cube one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's, there's only a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to order them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're not cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: This I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can use my name as a promo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just remembered that, but you get what
you paid for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like if you were buying Bobo
blasters, anything Bobo blaster makes
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got one sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be a little cleaned off and
used, but you know yourself, if you're
[SPEAKER_08]: making it, if you're making American
products, you're going to get what you pay
[SPEAKER_08]: for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And August house is American.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's, he, have you ever heard of them?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was happy that you finally got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you showed me them a while back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty small.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have actually brought it with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes in a little box where you can
take it along with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nail looked really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I say, I don't like emails,
but y'all have been seeing me and I like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can put my clear rates on top of that
and make it cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the lights on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You set it on top of that cube and it's
got that circle just where your rig is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to say you're shopping at Spencer's
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always going to be an old hippie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or a young hippie or hot topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a fun story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shop at the same place as granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeans and a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sneakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skate shoes for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you prefer for hiking shoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, DCs, etnies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skateboard shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snug them up real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people want to check out by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's give out all of our social media
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, everybody knows how to find the
Davin granny on all the social media at
[SPEAKER_02]: Davin underscore granny on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is, I think if you Google me,
you're going to find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, Google here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys watch the videos, watch the stuff
with all the Russian comments from other
[SPEAKER_02]: people and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what people from other countries say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The comments are my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people say, sometimes they're
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got to, if you're on the
internet, expect that dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I have come to learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody thought Sam and I were a couple.
[SPEAKER_08]: THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: They said, Oh dude, granny sex is the
best.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck as a couple.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we logged into Facebook live,
people asked if we were going to hook up
[SPEAKER_02]: when we were done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the nature of the beast with
the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have no lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes not everybody's trying to do
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there just trying to get
noticed and that's their way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not, if you're not part of
anything, you'll do your best to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: create something to be a part of.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody just say some profound shit on
accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has me gone.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms. Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: How they can find you because I think you
promised us that by the time we record it
[SPEAKER_02]: again, you'd have a website ready to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard that too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have a photo shoot on the 16th of
this month.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will be launching the website at the
end of this month.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, for real this time, I have been
working really hard on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it will be coming out at the end of the
month.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for now I am the traveling stoner on
Instagram and periscope.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you can find me on Twitter as the
travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can find me on Snapchat as a
travel and stoner without the G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what's your home address?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that address?
[SPEAKER_02]: Use maps to find where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in an undisclosed bunker.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, the studio needs a name.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how Instagram has that little
story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I deleted quite a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I actually, I didn't even want to
say the name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of the city.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I have learned people will try to
find me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just said, I was being on your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know, they don't know where you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you guys found me through granny's
feed by any way, if granny, if you learned
[SPEAKER_02]: of this podcast through granny,
send me a message or tag me in something
[SPEAKER_02]: and just say, Hey, I found you through the
diving granny so that I can give her a hug
[SPEAKER_02]: for every one of those followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So follow the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to get her together and get
her website up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take some pictures of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a cool camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even being creepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't give you the chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I want the sun coming from
that way and I need you over there and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll fucking take pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually just take pictures of weed to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be on a billboard off Colfax
Avenue.
[SPEAKER_08]: A real picture of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't know this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that one hat pin, the tall one
where I'm holding that teapot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: THC Sam and I had a photo shoot and
they're putting me on a billboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: For THC magazine, is that what you're
advertising?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is for Ooze 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooze for what kind of product is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this little teapot thing that goes on
a pan.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a bubbler attachment that looks
like a teapot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love smoking out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do an Instagram video with it so that we
can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're going to go one better when that
billboard's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do a group dab up under the
billboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a grand dab hanging from the
billboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that sound like fun?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hanging.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how but.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you Brett?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm Spiderman.
[SPEAKER_08]: Made me think of a, what was that show?
[SPEAKER_08]: The 70s show they used to climb up the
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've climbed up a few water towers in my
life.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Brett, by the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Brett.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just for being awesome and for always
being so positive and loving his videos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's been sick lately, so I hope
you're getting over it there and you're
[SPEAKER_14]: feeling better by the time this comes out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get with him and do this cold
turping thing that I've been hearing
[SPEAKER_08]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out and a
heads up to our buddy THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam wanted to come tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: His life's been overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got to interview Tommy Chong,
so he didn't have time to make it here
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tommy Chong?
[SPEAKER_08]: Us?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a photographer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He works for a magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: When somebody like Tommy Chong comes
through town, your job is to go take
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures and do magazine shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cannabis based magazine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, that's your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, you've got an open invitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are three chairs here at the table
that are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them has got your name on it
whenever you want to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Brett, I want to come get you to come
be on the show here at my house where
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got this good studio, the good mics
where the equipment doesn't screw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody interrupts other than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get you organized.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kabuki Fox.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had some real good conversations with
him about CBDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kabuki's been on a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's due for another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get him here again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have Kabuki across the table
talk about certain doses of specific
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids for certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So between the CBDs and Brett with the
turps, we're talking new age medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sam, Sam and I, I love to talk about
traumatic brain injuries with Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause of course everybody knows that I've
got a TBI that fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear it on the podcast occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just stop and start a brand new
sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't know if I'm even saying
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from getting hit in the head
really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that is from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize when that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to say that Sam is actually
running this food drive with us as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We forgot to even like, that's why Sam was
supposed to be here tonight.
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yes, Sam is also another big part of
helping us getting this food drive
[SPEAKER_14]: together.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's going to help us with the flyers.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we caught up on that and didn't
skip people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all high here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do people understand?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, at least we told them what the,
you know, food drive was about.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not concrete.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's we have Friday to get them day
boxes out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, we still have three spots
open for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Bobo, I did not forget you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a mental note.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got to let Bobo do plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still doing the burnisher thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that still available on big cartel.com?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still active.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get too many orders.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not super, super busy, but I'm still
doing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still available.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still do custom stuff with that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Focusing pretty heavily on the new glass
game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my new gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: So follow the new glass page, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow the new glass page.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have NoMeGlass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's N-O-M-E Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also follow my normal
Instagram is BoboblasterCo.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a B-O-B-O-B-L-A-S-T-E-R-C-O.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the same thing on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's all I'm on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not one of those people that's on
every single social media that's
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm barely on those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go through Spurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so happy to see him today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just thought of somebody else we
need to shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Color Me Filthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a new artist I've just become
friends with on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's embracing my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: And his name is Paul.
[SPEAKER_08]: Color Me Filthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're part of his little family.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the zombie photos I've been seeing
of everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turning you guys all green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just make stickers out of all those.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're pretty cool what he's been
doing to my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm addicted to Bitmojis.
[SPEAKER_14]: You are so obsessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the funniest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put a little Rasta Jeff everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing different funny shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm obsessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on, I'm on all of the damn
social medias.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Twitter, it's at GFYH Podcasts is
probably the best way to find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Instagram, it would be really rad if
you follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully by the time this episode comes
out, I'll be at 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Facebook, The Girl From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's enough of that social media
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to pitch too many more of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody for coming,
especially Granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got an hour drive home,
so we're gonna let you sober up so you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not medicated for the drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink, wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rest of us are gonna get high
as shit because we don't have too far to
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be safe and sober for your
drive home, all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here at my table, so I'm gonna take a
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just have to have some green crack
before I go, so I'm wide awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may do a little Facebook live video or
something here since we've got a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of cool ass people in the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're gonna wrap up the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you guys for
listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm gonna say that thing where
if you want to go to iTunes and leave us a
[SPEAKER_02]: review, that would be super duper cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will read your review on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got anything that you would like
to say and you do not want to do it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: public forum on social media, send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want some grow lessons,
if you need some advice, if you just want
[SPEAKER_02]: to say what's up, if you want to tell me
to go fuck myself, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good or bad, I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what people are thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be honest with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a blunt person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like honesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's all I've got for you this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys once again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I almost got through that whole thing
without coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to cough right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys did not hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have snuck that through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, good coughs, but shout out to my
buddy Frosty Organics for bringing some
[SPEAKER_02]: frosty gorilla glue over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yes, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: A newcomer, someone who has not been on
yet, but I promised him our no-till guest
[SPEAKER_02]: is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, Frosty Organics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm super happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been waiting to be on here for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've been listening to this for
a few years now, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I said show up and I said message me
and we can have you show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the minute that episode came out,
you sent me a message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, hey, dude, I want to be on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was super pumped, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about no-till
obviously today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to introduce another newcomer
sitting across from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy is visiting from, are you
visiting from North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's sharing a mic with Will, so he's
going to have to kind of lean in a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit, but he's visiting from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our new friend, I want to say Logan,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just told your name once and I
remembered it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, is that your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosty Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good to meet you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in from North Carolina,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is not legal there, is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this some culture shock to be able to
come out here and just drive around with
[SPEAKER_02]: weed in the car and?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, honestly, I've been smoking since a
very young age with old Will over here
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing weird to me because the taboo
is broken for myself, but to be out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so much more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always this looming impending
doom, but North Carolina is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalized too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get pulled over with weed and
you're not acting like a total jackass,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to cost like, I don't know,
$250 to $500, but it's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's better than going to jail,
but you never know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like taking a dab or anything,
man, reach over, grab any of the shatter,
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to load one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, here's a dab on this dab,
or if you want to take that man size dab,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't hurt yourself or do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys heard me mention him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying so hard not to cough,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been taking mad dabs over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend from Barefoot Extracts,
also the Barefoot Growers, across the
[SPEAKER_02]: table from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Barefoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we call you Will?
[SPEAKER_02]: Call you Barefoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barefoot, Will, whatever you want to call
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That beard is coming in manly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been getting a lot of compliments on
it lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you trim it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you even it out or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, every couple of weeks I'll go
through and kind of hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of get the loose ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a thickness, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's manly now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little ... You're about to raid
some villages or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just might.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we were going to talk about
no-till, but before we get that far,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank these guys for joining me
because they've been here for like an hour
[SPEAKER_02]: and 20 minutes and all we've done is take
dabs and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking time out of your
evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in a water bottle and be like,
I'm high and having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got kids, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got a garden and a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I need to give a huge shout out to
my friends at thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need some new genetics for your
garden, some feminized or regular seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: check out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know that you heard about them on
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, shout out to our friends at
HandmadeApparel.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some cool shit coming up from our
friends at Handmade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I owe a huge shout out to my
friend Task Rock and Highly Educated
[SPEAKER_02]: Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day I went to the mailbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't feel worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate something that kicked my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I was not living.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I went to the mailbox and I opened up
the mail and there was a gift in the mail
[SPEAKER_02]: from Task Rock and Highly Educated
Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the new, it's a quartz and titanium
combo domeless e-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, domeless, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I still say domeless.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, you guys, we used to put
a dome on the dab rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a titanium nail with a quartz
dish with a little protective titanium
[SPEAKER_02]: shroud, I think is the appropriate word.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got like a shield around it so that
you can carry your quartz nail with you
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't have to feel as paranoid
like you're going to break it because I am
[SPEAKER_02]: a breaky guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to break glass shit and I will
break a quartz nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a quartz nail that I will not
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is able to be attached to my barrel
style e-nail coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it much better on my flat e-nail
coil and it's also able to be used without
[SPEAKER_02]: the e-nail setup as just an on the go
nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a sweet product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I like it a lot better with the
flat coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to end up being used
mostly with a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it as much with the barrel
coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't heat up the way I wanted it to
heat up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take globs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would work for you probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody over here was like,
your nail is hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all making this, everybody that
hit my e-nail is looking at me like,
[SPEAKER_02]: your fucking nail is hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: My throat hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time Will was here and he kind of led
on a little bit about no-till growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, elaborate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, you got to get frosty over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got frosty organics over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should ask frosty a couple of questions
before we do that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, really growing like for real
growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say a little over two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've just been getting at this and
you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably closer to three years,
but like really figuring out what I was
[SPEAKER_05]: doing and doing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say about two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long into your grow career did you
decide to go no-till?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've been at the no-till for like a
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: A year.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're good at it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that Gorilla Glue 4 you brought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is frosty as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lives up to your name.
[SPEAKER_05]: My soils get at it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like the way this guy thinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're making, where'd you get your
soil recipe?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a guy that I've been following for
a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Coop on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clackamascus Coop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clackamascus Coop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clackamascus is old school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clackamascus is old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said Coop, I thought that might
be who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's really into like K and F like Korean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Korean natural farming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really, everybody I think that does
no-till is like basically based off of his
[SPEAKER_05]: soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took his soil recipe and then just
added our own things into it, but he's
[SPEAKER_05]: really like the founder of no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since we're talking about who the
founder is, tell us a little about what
[SPEAKER_02]: note, what's the difference between
no-till and what most of us are probably
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us are probably going to the
store, getting bottles, mixing shit up in
[SPEAKER_02]: a shot glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weighing it out into a bucket,
pouring it in, mixing it up, making sure
[SPEAKER_02]: the pH is right, and then pouring that
onto our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So teach us a little about the difference
of what no-till is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no-till is just basically kind of
like living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Living soil is basically a super soil that
everybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody got into an organic way and
they're like, well, you can feed,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, just water to this soil and your
plants will do what it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically all the inputs in your soil
is doing what it's supposed to for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in nature, you don't see anything
in nature doesn't get fed with a bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already in the dirt and it eats it as
it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It breaks it down naturally because the
decomposition happens from other things in
[SPEAKER_02]: the earth and the worms and poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then that's available as needed by
the plant and the plant isn't force-fed
[SPEAKER_02]: basically or starving for anything,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was doing super soil there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super soil is okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes your soil is too hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put too many amendments in it or
maybe the amendments that are in there for
[SPEAKER_05]: deep in flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you might've put your soil together
a little bit before you threw it into
[SPEAKER_05]: flower, you know, a late in veg or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might've transplanted into your five
gallon right before you threw it into
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might start getting too heavy of
newts, you know, or I guess natural
[SPEAKER_05]: amendments being broken down and feeding
your plants too hot and it'll burn your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the, the way to get away from
that is, is to just the natural way with
[SPEAKER_05]: no till is to have basically the same
thing, but then we have like compost and
[SPEAKER_05]: then we have, you know, worms in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't put worms in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put earthworm castings from a guy
here in town named Don.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has the greatest earthworm castings
ever, but it has cocoons in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those worms will come to life after
like, you know, a few days actually,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it'll have little worms in there
too, you know, little bitty worms and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff in there already.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, once they start getting fed
and stuff like that, you just need to have
[SPEAKER_05]: mulch on top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause what you want to do is you want to
keep, basically you want to just keep
[SPEAKER_05]: your, your soil very, very moist on top
just because you want your worms to come
[SPEAKER_05]: to the top and to break down all your top
dressings.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever you do a transplant from your
one gallon, so usually in a one gallon,
[SPEAKER_05]: when I veg, I just use like some shitty
soil, you know, something that's very
[SPEAKER_05]: base, you know, you could use pro mix if
you wanted, you know, I mean, if that's
[SPEAKER_05]: what you chose, I use more something that,
you know, shout to Don again, Don makes a
[SPEAKER_05]: base soil for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put my plants in there in one
gallons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've edged them with just water only just
for like a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three weeks after that, I put them into
their, their new pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I've edged them for a week in
their, in their no-till pots, but their
[SPEAKER_05]: no-till pots are already working and
already already inoculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about what goes into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what goes into that
no-till pot before we put the plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long before I put my one gallon
pot into that no-till, do I want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: that mixed up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need some time to let it get cooking?
[SPEAKER_02]: You do for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to make it on your own,
you can buy a soil mix now that is
[SPEAKER_05]: basically Coots mix plus all the extra
things we were putting in it for a few
[SPEAKER_05]: years, you know, we were having to,
you know, make our soil mixes and put all
[SPEAKER_05]: these extra things in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we started buying like a soil mix on
build a soil.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still have to put extra things in
it, you know, to make it exactly what you
[SPEAKER_05]: want it to be rich enough to be able to go
all through flower and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: to have your worms and your microbe life
and your beneficials really working,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so after, after we, you know,
we're doing that for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he came out with a, it's called a
modern mix version 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has, what is the compost in it,
Will?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from Malibu compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only heard good things about those
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the richest compost I've
ever used.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing bad I've heard about them
is it's hard to get sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very hard to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very hard to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Must be good shit then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super good shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeremy started making a super good soil
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've used his soil a few times now on a
few new pots that I've had to put together
[SPEAKER_05]: on some new rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all my older pots that are like four
or five rounds in, I built those like all
[SPEAKER_05]: the way up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we, we mixed the compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: We mixed the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to, you know, mix each amendment
in, you know, one cup to each cubic foot,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know what I'm saying?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had to, you know, had to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess you'd have it sit there
for maybe like a week or two, but then you
[SPEAKER_05]: would just, you know, put everything in
there, put your top dress on there,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, put your earthworm castings in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd put your, your, your cover crop and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just let it come to life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then by the time you put your plant in
there, it's already working and it'll just
[SPEAKER_05]: overtake your plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you even put shitty soil in there,
it'll overtake that shit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can start with old shitty recycled
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I like to take my old soil that
plants have already been in and I will put
[SPEAKER_02]: clones in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clones, if you got a clone from me,
chances are it came in recycled soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no bugs in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how good your clones look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can start in shitty soil if you're
going into no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got it set up about a week in
advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to put water in there after
we've got all the nutrients and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments in there and the soil in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to water it a week in advance
or do you just want to let it sit kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you want it moist or do you want it
kind of dry?
[SPEAKER_05]: You should water it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely water it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll get it kind of moving in there
and get all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the microbe life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it congealed together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your beneficials eating and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause whenever we put those earthworm
castings in there, they definitely already
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot of beneficials and stuff in
there working with the worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, just it's so rich that
that shit's so rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes so fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gives it to us fresh out of the compost
of the worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got it going on over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know another guy that had something
similar and I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get your pots loaded up about a
week in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the Modern Mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to add some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Subcool's Super Soil Recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way he throws a tarp on the ground and
mixes the super soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just using a different mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the Modern Mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find your own recipe on making some
no-till soil and perfect it for your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get a good start with the Modern
Mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like, but your plants are going
to want different shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to protect,
perfect it for each plant, but this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then get your plants into there about a
week after you make the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you said mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep mulch on top to keep the
worms feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to use for mulch?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use old stems, old branches and
stuff like that from old harvests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I take the leaves that I'm
lollipopping?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's food already available for the
worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there waiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cut the cover crop as it's growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I growing as cover crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comfrey, lemongrass.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to think lemongrass will keep bugs
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're growing lemongrass right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's keeping bugs away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask about some pest
management and no-till here in a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds, but it sounds like we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemongrass, what else can I use to keep
the pests away on my no-till crop?
[SPEAKER_05]: Eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosemary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those types of essential oils.
Time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, natural stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really spray neem oil on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Karanja oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has a more milder smell and it's easier
to, I don't know, to fuck with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just easier to mix and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said it, my face wrinkled up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something if you get a tiny drop
of neem oil on anything, it feels like I
[SPEAKER_02]: can taste it for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it gets on my hand, I can taste
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that sounds crazy, but it
doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most terrible flavor ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I've used plenty of neem oil on
stuff, but okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically essential oils will help you
keep your pests away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow the lemongrass in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works as cover crop and it's going to
keep some bugs out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the basics to get you started
and set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we need to think about?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got mulch, we've got cover crop,
we've got some good hot soil to keep us
[SPEAKER_02]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you're just growing now,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to water them when they're
thirsty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water, do some top dresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Top dresses, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to use for top dress?
[SPEAKER_04]: Worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do some neem meal,
some neem seed meal, neem seed meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of words.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: A neem seed meal, kelp meal, biochar is
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worm castings, some fish compost is real
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, alfalfa meal is real good,
especially right when you transplant,
[SPEAKER_04]: get a fresh dose of nitrogen right to them
right when they're transplanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like kelp and seed products
completely add to the flavors and aromas
[SPEAKER_02]: and density a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do a neem and kelp tea every other
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever foliar feed with your teas
that you make?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't really make teas anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just more about just top dressings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever you go into flower, malted barley
once a week.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of enzymes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sugars, you know, stuff like that will
make your buds real sweet, make them dense
[SPEAKER_05]: up and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I do a lot of potassium silicate
too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you use?
[SPEAKER_05]: Agisil 16H.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just make my own.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just make my own liquid of it and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using the bottled OSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still a baby over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say 28's good though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I used to use that whenever I was
doing Super Souls and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like Build A Soil gets a lot of
free shout outs on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they have everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just click on their website and
you can literally build a soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question, they've got a
chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a regimen for everything on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, man, we can get, I had one of my basic
questions here is how do we start,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you go get some Modern Mix 2.0 and you
get some pots filled with it and you water
[SPEAKER_02]: them and you grow some clones and then you
throw it in there and then you pay
[SPEAKER_02]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next time you're going to
have to add amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've taken care of our pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, we're flushing the whole time,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not flushing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're basically just feeding your worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically you're just feeding the worms
in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget about the worms in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the worms are shitting,
you know, and then the beneficials come
[SPEAKER_05]: and break down the worm poop and the worm
poop turns into humus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now at the end, you cut down your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you just dig a little hole next to
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That stock and put your next clone right
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you getting it started again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just rip your root ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just rip that sucker right out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to get as little, you don't want to
take the root ball out, shake it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get as little dirt out as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you don't want to add any new soil
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to just keep using the same soil
over and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing you want to add is new
amendments and new top dresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Compose.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you needed to add more like soil or if
you transplant and needed to add something
[SPEAKER_05]: to actually transplant, you just put
compost and earthworm castings and stuff.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, yeah, I would just fill that hole
with worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love doing that when I transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put a nice layer of castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw some, some gray white shark or
something in there and get that moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what are you going to re-amend it
with the second time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Worm castings, compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's less of a re-amendment and more of
just top dressing, refeeding everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the cover crop going to just keep
growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like a perpetual thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut it, it grows back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that you cut off, can you throw
that into a tea and make kind of a compost
[SPEAKER_02]: tea out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using comfrey and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just usually use it as mulch on top of
the top though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys don't go to the grow store
anymore?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even if you wanted to,
you know, make your own, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: basically like, if you want to push your
plants extra hard, you can use like
[SPEAKER_05]: Calphos and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make your own calcium and
phosphorus, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like all these processes are
super sustainable, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially once you get to like a certain
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just, that's great for your
soil anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're just like building your
own little like ecosystem, like out of
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the major problems of home
growing is that when you're done,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got all this trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got sticks, you've got leaves,
you've got dirt bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even think about the bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottles you could throw on the trash,
but it's all that dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I grow, when I used to have,
I had an old trap house where I would do
[SPEAKER_02]: like 20, how many did I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's 28 seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a lot of soil when you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would have to find somewhere smooth
to throw all that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily I have a friend who grows an
outdoor vegetable garden and I would just
[SPEAKER_02]: have him come pick it all up in his truck
and he would just haul it off for me in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I didn't have that hookup,
what am I going to do with 28 seven gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: pots worth of soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't even have to worry about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your worms just go and they're like,
oh, you need new dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got you covered, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you just keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then you get to throw your sticks
in there and you're also composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys run into a Bokashi bucket?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love my Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can, I mean, I like to make
some fermentation and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can make a fermented fruit and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like super beneficial for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you hang out with Sean a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use a lot of aloe vera in anything
you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a lot of, the plants love that
stuff, don't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: And coconut, the coconut water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a lot of enzymes to help break
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love drinking coconut water myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel super hydrated and I feel like if I
feed that to the plants, they've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great enzyme.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that comes out of the Bokashi
bucket will break down all that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually just started using that at
work, not out of the bucket, but we just
[SPEAKER_04]: started using the Bokashi at work to help
break down compost on our beds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll speed it up and it'll give you that
white funk layer too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that beautiful mycelium layer that
people get afraid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people- My buddy, he just
started growing organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is his first time ever growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He decided to go in at organics and he got
a nice layer of mycelium on his plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: he sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I think I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My plants got mold on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, dude, you're doing it
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, I get it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mushrooms and shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it on Facebook or Instagram every
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh shit, my soil is making shrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just exactly what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just the right humidity and the
right fucking pH in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing shrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, that's going to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to fall apart back into the
soil and your plants going to eat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do anything differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wrote down how cost effective is
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like it's a one-time deal,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you got to occasionally buy more
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to buy some more neem and
kelp meal, because I do neem and kelp
[SPEAKER_04]: teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just do those every third watering,
I think, and then as top dresses as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on how much you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the soil goes, yeah,
it's basically a one... You're not buying
[SPEAKER_04]: seven bags of soil every time you do the
transplant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 28, seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just still there moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you don't have to...
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a lot of work, but it also
sounds like it's saving me a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the long run, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to go to the grocery store
and buy bottles, which are expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a lot of... I'm paying for the
water to be shipped, it feels like,
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially, because I read the
ingredients and all that shit's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It build the soil in a dry form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the difference between like
potassium silica, like we were talking,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you get pre-mixed potassium silicate in
a bottle, it's going to cost like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, 10 times more, if not more than
that, then what the bag of the powder
[SPEAKER_04]: comes in and you can make 10 times as much
that comes in the bottle with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got me rethinking everything I do
and... Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make a gallon with 568 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: A potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: 148 grams a liter.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like... I mean, that's simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I wish I could... I want to start off
just like one or two pots of some stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and just see if I can see what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can run it next to my botanic hair grow
or whatever brand I'm using, my Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it'll kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll overtake them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll probably even see... You'll
probably even see beneficials might even
[SPEAKER_04]: hop into your other soil if you get your
other soil hopping that well, if it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really going... Because they'll want to
go... They're going to want to spread out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to want to go to where
they're going to be needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to just move over to the
other pots and be like, oh, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: you look lonely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll help you get rid of some PM if you
have anything in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good, as Frosty always says.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's plenty of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lactobacillus serum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a buddy that had some other plants
that got some PM on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you want to get rid of
that real quick?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just took some lactobacillus serum.
[SPEAKER_05]: You spray that for three days and it's
completely gone because beneficial fungi
[SPEAKER_05]: overtakes bad fungi.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a farmer's tale about PM being
systematic and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely not systematic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went through his whole flower period
and had no PM.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: PM can be a real bitch sometimes in
Colorado when the temperature changes here
[SPEAKER_02]: and it changes every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to cut down rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was about to say yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were wearing shorts and I was like,
it's too warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had on shorts and a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now today I woke up and I was like,
it's cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's snowing and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hoping on Friday, a little brag
here, I get to go see Joe Rogan at
[SPEAKER_02]: ComedyWorks Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just hoping don't snow until
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't snow until Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fucking got me on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I jinxed myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, that'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to a lot of comedy shows and Joe
Rogan is probably one of the few that
[SPEAKER_02]: really get me super pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go to as many as I go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, I'm going to a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rogan and Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lucky enough to see Diaz also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_02]: 26 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like you guys both follow the
TLO book quite a bit as a good way to get
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you recommend the TLO book from the
Rev?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever grown any of his seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like he puts out some good seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't grown any of them yet,
but I've got a pack somewhere that I
[SPEAKER_02]: should grow, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he's grown fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been doing it for so long that he
better have the fire by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made him change his Facebook page to
his real name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really weird seeing all these
people's real names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the TLO book, True Living
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the other book that he did that I
did not write down the name of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody went blank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the Rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out his cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Teeming with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the book I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the Rev also?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not the Rev.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just some- It's not even about
cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just about- Soil Food Web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all about the Soil Food Web.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll check out Teeming with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll teach you how to keep your Soil Food
Web rocking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Read TLO first because Teeming with
Microbes is a little bit- Overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really beginner information.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to have kind of an idea of what's
going on or it'll just go right over your
[SPEAKER_04]: head otherwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It skips a lot of- You'll have to Google
all the basics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So read TLO.
[SPEAKER_04]: TLO is a great one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once you get a good handle on
that, you think you have an understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: of how organics work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to dive a little deeper,
open up Teeming with Microbes and learn
[SPEAKER_04]: about the Soil Food Web because that's
where no-till really comes into play.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Soil Food Web because that's what's
happening inside of your soil is you've
[SPEAKER_04]: got a whole ecosystem of microorganisms
living, breeding, excreting, feeding your
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, definitely check both of those
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other books you two would recommend
while you're talking about books?
[SPEAKER_04]: Teeming with Nutrients is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit less about organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same guys that did Teeming with
Microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've skimmed through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have it at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've skimmed through it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just more- Yes, it's less organic
based, but if you don't want to do the
[SPEAKER_04]: full organic ride, which I understand some
people don't want to do it, check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll kind of give you a little bit better
understanding of what's going on in your
[SPEAKER_04]: soil with your nutrients and bottle
feeding and stuff.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys ever get any of your no-till
products tested by any of the labs?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't yet, but I want to really soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think me and my buddy, we're going to go
up to Springs to what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: CB1 Analytics or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: CB1.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Nate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they reputable?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you give them a name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: CB1.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Nate.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado Springs, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know there was a testing facility
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they do like the
pesticides on it though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted them to do a full analysis just
so I could just show how food grade our
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is that we don't spray no
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't use no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't use bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could test it all the way down and
it's just going to be a pure cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see the tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see what kind of THC,
CBD, CBG, CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's coming out on the no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just smoked and saw your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm high as shit
from smoking some of Frosty's Frosty
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla Glue 4.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichomes were really short and all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't look like they got really tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like they were fighting for
space in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's just me, the way I feed my
plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying it was Frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were fighting for space in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got good and heavily medicated on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about where people can acquire
some of your great smokeables?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you feel like you want
to mention on the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, I could totally hit a little bit
of editing and take this part right out.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our friends at the Canna
Canyon in beautiful Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I carry a lot of my product over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you could say I'm kind of a co-op
grower for them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They carry my product there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are a member there, you can go
reimburse my product there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the streets and stuff like that,
personally, that's not my thing and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Canyon is what I was shooting for.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: People from anywhere, if you're 21 and
over, you're able to come to the Canna
[SPEAKER_02]: Canyon in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Colorado Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot think of the exact address.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 1505, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1507.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will's going to search for me while I
ramble on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to the Canna Canyon in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're 21 and over, if you've got a
valid ID and you're not an asshole,
[SPEAKER_02]: we invite you to come to the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please sign up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join as a member.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign the member agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the address, bro?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1507 West Colorado Avenue in beautiful
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parking in the front is kind of a bitch,
but parking in the back is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go into the alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to park diagonal in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's near the 7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see the 7-Eleven, go across the
street.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have an ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign the member agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chances are I might be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deb and Granny might be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will might be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosty could be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only in town for a few days,
but shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time this episode comes out,
my new friend Logan could be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm there taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The traveling stoner is there all the damn
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Camille is there all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the dogs, but you can also
grab some flowers that were done by our
[SPEAKER_02]: good friend Frosty here that are totally
organic, that are beautiful, that are
[SPEAKER_02]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I was there, I think they had
some of the Gorilla Glue on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crowd favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't stay long.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get busy when some stuff comes
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a huge shout out to the Cannon
Cannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can write the checkout to Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to plug myself, you can also find my
extracts on the shelves there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said on the little parchment paper that
it was 27 point something grams when you
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped it off is what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, it was nowhere near 27 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been telling me it's been selling
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're happy with it, so I'm happy with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been being reimbursed for quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you said, but that's
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do go to the club, the Cannon
Canyon or any of the clubs, learn the
link.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go, please say the proper shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the proper terminology, nomenclature,
whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reimbursed however it goes there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know sometimes it feels silly,
but that's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've covered most of No-Till,
and it sounds like this is a perfect segue
[SPEAKER_02]: into something else that I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, in Denver,
Colorado, they voted yes to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption of cannabis in adult places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some bars and clubs will begin allowing
people to smoke cannabis in certain
[SPEAKER_02]: sections indoors in places.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we're going to have social
lounges in Denver very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people are looking for buildings
to rent right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are already places that function
kind of illegitimately, kind of under the
[SPEAKER_02]: radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those places are probably going to blow up
and be popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there are people out there right now
looking for property, painting the walls,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting shit set up, stockpiling product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's one up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say who it is,
but I've been there a couple of times and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just- I've been to a couple,
just like Springs, I've been to a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: that are really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Cannon Canyon, the couches,
they went to a nice place and bought brand
[SPEAKER_02]: new couches.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bought a rug that matched.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went with the paint on the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a table with end tables that all
match.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a shelf that's the same kind of
wood as the tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it looks like somebody really,
they got, they had like their gay interior
[SPEAKER_02]: decorator friend came and helped him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a competitive editor that's very
near there that looks like they got all of
[SPEAKER_02]: their shit at the fucking, the thrift
store down the street and their fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: dog laid on it for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly won't let my dreadlocks touch
that couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't let my dreads down in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep my dreads tied up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't let my backpack out of my site in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Cannon Canyon, I'll go take a piss
and leave my backpack and my rig and my
[SPEAKER_02]: hash on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's crew in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the homie place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other place, and there are other
places that are in the middle and above
[SPEAKER_02]: and below that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some where I won't even take my
backpack in because I feel like I might
[SPEAKER_02]: get jacked for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some that are so damn loud cause
the band is playing constantly and I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: even be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to be able to have clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope somebody does it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be some cool places.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't all have to be reggae lounges.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, they don't all have to be
dubstep bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be cool if Chiba Hut was like,
if they let one of their places,
[SPEAKER_04]: if they turn one of their places into a
smoking friendly, how cool would that be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not both of them, but if they did
the Colfax one, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about like a smoking night at a
bowling alley?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you need to get, if it's a
permit or a special license you'll need to
[SPEAKER_04]: get.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it's one of those things you
can be like, Hey, can we get a permit for
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday night so we can allow smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just like a, and we're all
hypothetical now, you guys, this is all
[SPEAKER_02]: shit that is going to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I preach this all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're writing rules in your area,
write this shit in so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to sit here and make it up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you don't write these rules in
your rulemaking, old people in suits that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't give a fuck about cannabis,
that don't take dabs, that don't go out
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to write these rules and it's
going to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you can get like, like you get a
liquor license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pay for a year of a cannabis
consumption license so that every night
[SPEAKER_02]: after 9 PM you can consume cannabis in
your facility or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From nine to two, nine to three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that way when they had two,
when you got to collect all the drinks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you take some dabs and hang out and
socialize.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way nobody ever gets in a fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got something to say, pass him a mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my, my thought too is what about
like, if you bring your own like dabs to
[SPEAKER_01]: these places, is that going to be allowed?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the way it's going to
work with our marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: division system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mostly the way it's going to have
to work as a bring your own cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they'll cut the loop,
the loophole out of that one pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly because they've seen how it
worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've seen how it works down in Colorado
Springs with the loopholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like they'll probably make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, all right, there's no,
no reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a co-op.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, you can bring, I think they'll
make it pretty clear that it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: there will be no money handed to anybody
for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have to have, you know what I'd
love to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it a barcade as a theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to the bars, you get drinks and
play video games.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just stand there like, I like
supernova in Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just kind of stand there like,
this is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can play some street fighter and all you
fucking drunks are spilling beer on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like honestly, I would like a beer,
but unfortunately I don't know how to have
[SPEAKER_02]: a beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have about 20 or 30 beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just don't drink at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot better for me because I'll have
a beer and then somebody would be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want a shot?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I do want a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do you want another shot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I don't know where the fuck I am
or where my money or my car is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I drink a lot of shots and I just,
there's no, there's just no line for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I choose not to drink at all,
but I can smoke like the best of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish that while all my friends are at
supernova drinking and doing shots,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a fat joint in my hand and play
some street fighter too, man, throw some
[SPEAKER_02]: sonic booms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be up there playing some tech in and
slaying it all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody open up a, so that would be
the way to have some video games,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some laser tag in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I said, this opens up,
yeah, the ganja gourmet can go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: their original format.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you used to be able to go smoke at the
ganja gourmet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just go get some really good food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that would also like bring OSHA in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if, or just with smoking,
you know, cause smoke is like banned,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I think nationwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's state to state or county to
county.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the clean air act.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not supposed to be able to smoke
in places, but if that's why I was saying
[SPEAKER_02]: you could get that yearly liquor license,
that cannabis consumption license,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would probably break that, give you
that rule override somehow, your card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure like, again, like once the
taboo is just broken down, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in these restaurants and places,
you know, people just aren't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine like by the third or fourth
cannabis night at the bowling alley,
[SPEAKER_02]: bowl night at the bowling alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be like, dude,
the snack bar fucking crushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never sold so many nachos ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there were a couple of dudes who just
stood there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid for their bowling shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucking stood there and stared at the
lane moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I see in my mind too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be the manager of bowling alley
that used to do the black light bowling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could see it all in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could have just smoked in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, everything would have been
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had so many fights in there because we
served tons of alcohol and you turn on
[SPEAKER_02]: music and you got music, girls and
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the three things that
eventually add to a fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're dudes bowling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a strike raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guys next to him got a gutter
ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're like, oh yeah,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they're going to fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it fucking once a week in a bowling
alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take a dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're trying to fight,
hit this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the worst they pass out and
problem's all there anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why was I trying to fight you again,
dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got good weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just become best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that we had a really serious lesson
on no-till and then we turned it into
[SPEAKER_02]: whole chatter, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are from other states like
yourself that don't get to be here and
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in this kind of love to hear us
chatter about what it's like to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get messages like, bro,
it's like hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like freedom for some people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to listen to the podcast back when
I lived in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember it kind of being like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I was like, man, it sounds like
it's cool over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like when those Maddie and
Spence would come on the show and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: just like, well, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Maddie and Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see those kids doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I met you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it weren't for Maddie and Spence,
I wouldn't be the one of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I met you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I met y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're all grown the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like everybody that I know,
for the most part, I've met either
[SPEAKER_04]: through, that I haven't met through work,
I've met through them or through somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: I met through them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you from, Frosty?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never knew that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assumed you were from North Carolina
just because everybody else that I met
[SPEAKER_02]: through Spence was from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I actually, you know, I met Spence a
long time ago whenever, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the greener side was still open and all
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually met him through Hank and stuff
like that, you know, so I've known Spencer
[SPEAKER_05]: for, you know, quite some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardner Weedon crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posts pics of that little kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I get tired of seeing people's kids
on Instagram and on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goddamn Hank's son's a handsome little
G.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude's going to be a pimp,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, hide your fucking
daughter because Hank's kid, Lucas,
[SPEAKER_02]: is coming to get her.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's coming to get her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a pimp.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a baller.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a handsome little devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He dresses and looks just like daddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a little micro pimp.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got anything else that you want
to say on a podcast since you've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot of people listening to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to smoke, you know,
the terpias, you know, the tastiest,
[SPEAKER_05]: smoothest, cleanest cannabis that you can
consume, you know, go organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to heal somebody,
if you're trying to get rid of cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you're trying to take care of
people, that have conditions like Crohn's
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, or possibly an autoimmune
disease, or anything that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: take care of, you don't want to give
people shit medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give them quality medicine
that is actually medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to take shit into their
bodies, they just go get pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd go to the pharmacy and get some
pills and get some poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please let's not poison people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not spray stupid shit on our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing with bottles,
I'm not hating on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow with bottles, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use Botanicare Pure Blend Pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done plenty of that organic as fuck
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lifestyle and the way that I learned
how to grow, I'm really comfortable with
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys kind of inspire me to step
outside the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may see me do some attempts at some
no-till stuff, but we're not hating on
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are growing with bottles,
do me one favor and flush heavily for at
[SPEAKER_02]: least 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 20 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a longer strain,
go ahead and flush for 20 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your leaves start looking a little bit
yellow, you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get mad at some yellow leaves at the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means a plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your plant is using up the nutrients
that it needed and it is now time to come
[SPEAKER_02]: down, look outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's fall time, what happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves change colors and they come off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plant is saying, it's fall time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when you should cut it down and take
care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one more thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: To anybody that hasn't started growing yet
and if you want to get into growing and
[SPEAKER_04]: you think you eventually do want to get
into organics and you think it might be
[SPEAKER_04]: smarter to learn with bottles first,
I would advise you just go ahead and jump
[SPEAKER_04]: straight into organics because it's two
totally different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll learn how to grow with nutrients
and be like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to switch to organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's entirely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to buy so much different shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much different.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know you want to do organics,
just go from the get go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go no-till because in my opinion,
it sounds like no-till, it's going to cost
[SPEAKER_02]: you a little bit more to get started,
but you're going to have to buy worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need modern mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to get a head start
on yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you're buying something
like advanced nutrients or mills,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're buying bottles every week,
bottles every month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that adds up real quick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just get yourself some no-till and
you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only have to buy it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that first harvest, you've paid for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even richer and richer and richer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Round 30 is going to be the best round
you've had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to get better and better and
better and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And better and better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got to think it's going to be
like the forest or like the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest plants in the world are in the
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the richest soil in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically your soil is going to be
mimicking the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's undisturbed out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing fucks with it except nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much humics in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things die and things decompose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely with compost on top of just any
style of growing anything, if you just
[SPEAKER_01]: recycle all vegetables and stuff and even
bits of food, you can really get those
[SPEAKER_01]: worms eating and fatter and healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all just feeds itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will there ever be a point when I have too
many worms in my pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They regulate themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: They multiply relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be surprised at how fast you get a
good bit, but they also, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: they regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to, they know like,
okay, there's only X amount of space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus I don't really know the lifespan on a
worm, but I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them die off and stuff like that,
but it just goes on to nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: They become part of the humus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have nutrients in them though,
so that's good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: In TLO, I think the Rev actually gives a
nice little setup on how to make a worm
[SPEAKER_02]: farm so that you can make your own worm
castings from the worms as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be fully sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the worm castings in your garage
because it does kind of stink a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got to feed it calm, but like just
it's mostly what you put in and it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a vegetarian, so I'm throwing in
like avocado peels and apple cores and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tips of the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be super rich though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super rich in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: My plants loved it when I was feeding them
that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were sweet and sticky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I shouldn't even tell you how many
people listen, but within 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing this episode, about 5,000 people
will download and listen to this between
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes, Stitcher and my website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus I'm available on like seven or eight
other podcasting applications that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even pay any attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are going to hear this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you guys coming and
helping out the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, we appreciate you having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to get you guys on.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love to hear this type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely information people need
to know because this is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always talk about end of the world
scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be at rating hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to need the last bit of the bottles
because it's all going to the end.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do this with, this is no-till
work with a lot of other, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not just weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do no-till with basically
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to do top dress and amended it
a little bit differently depending on what
[SPEAKER_04]: you do, but you know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, into the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, like no-till you've got a
sustainable garden out front.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys will be growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be making a raft out of bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosty, remind everybody how they can
stalk you on social media so they can
[SPEAKER_02]: check you out and give you a follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can follow me on Instagram at frosty
