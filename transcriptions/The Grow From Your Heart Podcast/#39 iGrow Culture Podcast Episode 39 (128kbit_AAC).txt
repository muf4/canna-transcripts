[SPEAKER_00]: We had an election last night Colorado did
not have much cannabis initiative on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballots But we did have number 105
regarding non-gmo food.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the labeling of gmo foods
Colorado dude, you failed bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell this was supposed to pass
This was what this was we're not gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: too much into it because it's already
happened This was we wanted them to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to mark genetically modified food products
with some sort of indication that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically modified Enriched with GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not pass this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is going on, Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and it fell by landslide that's
the really disappointing part I liked your
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse Broder really good Facebook post.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said something to the effect of that's
okay, Colorado I didn't want to share my
[SPEAKER_00]: organic produce with you anyway Jesse's
tomatoes are delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one other place I've eaten
recently that's got tomatoes nearly as
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty as Jesse's I know where that place
is did they get so many shoutouts on this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm addicted to that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat there a lot we went up there with
burned and burns cousin and They made
[SPEAKER_01]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they made friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you like your family when you're
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know my name by now They start
writing down my order when they see me in
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like you want the same thing dude
and I'm like Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a I've never seen that many
Madea different drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like I was a little overwhelmed
at first It is it's a little strange the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time you walk in with the the vibe
there is very unique So when you walk in
[SPEAKER_01]: you're almost in a new world turn your
cell phone off when you go in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: please I agree, but there are so many
people in there I go I've gone late at
[SPEAKER_00]: night and midday and if you go during the
day, it's like It's 20 somethings with
[SPEAKER_00]: their MacBooks and their iPhones All over
the place, but you're right around around
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 or 12 I wish There were some people
playing chess and yeah a couple people
[SPEAKER_01]: look like they were on a date or something
It's just real chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's playing chess in there look like
robots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so good at chess the one guy I
Swear he was playing chess with the guy in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of him and then he was also playing
it on his iPad Is predicting what could
[SPEAKER_01]: happen or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I was like man, so I've got a funny
joke that only a few listeners are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get we were at it's we're talking about a
place called the Monte factor and they
[SPEAKER_00]: make yerba mate It's a Brazilian
energizing tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the dark yerba mate,
which is what I prefer And then they have
[SPEAKER_00]: got the green yerba mate, which I prefer
the green iced and I like the dark hot
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my preference So if I need a
cool drink, I'll get the green one The guy
[SPEAKER_00]: was describing the differences to a
customer who it's in a really touristy
[SPEAKER_00]: area So you get a lot of touristy kind of
people they're describing this drink to a
[SPEAKER_00]: tourist and he said that the dark roast is
The dried leaves that have been set out
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've dried and they crumble it and
then they brew it or they grind it Then
[SPEAKER_00]: they brew it together and he said the
green is more the fresh leaf that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been dried and set out for as long And I
heard him say that and I looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: girl that was with me and I said he's
talking about that live res Only a few
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners gonna laugh at that but that's
exactly the description that worked
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly It's all about that live resin
the dark roast is the dried and cured and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the fresh green is a live res And you
can taste the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a huge I had only ever had the
green before I went up there and I got the
[SPEAKER_01]: dark and was like, yeah, this is the shit
All right They don't know that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna happen But if anybody that listens
to this podcast goes to the Monte factor
[SPEAKER_00]: in Manitou Springs Say something about you
heard about say I heard about this place
[SPEAKER_00]: from the I grow culture podcast and they
told me to say hi and Then maybe they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: catch on Because they know who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said that I'm the host of a show
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe one day they'll maybe I just
want a free veggie wrap out of the deal I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a free muffin from them the other
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really kind to give me a fresh
warm free muffin All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of talk about the Monte
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is so good, bro If you go up
there go hike on Rainbow Falls I never
[SPEAKER_00]: said nothing about the secret Rainbow
Falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That place is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find it go hike it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool graffiti falls so we're talking
about the the votes that Happened last
[SPEAKER_00]: night Oregon Alaska and Washington DC have
legalized recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the cool kid club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Florida on the other hand You're just
old people in Disney World still how many
[SPEAKER_01]: people in Florida Do you think could
actually reduce their like their their
[SPEAKER_01]: pain medication consumption?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drastically, so do you think that maybe
some of those pain companies the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinics kind of lobbied against all of
this medical cannabis or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, surely not I mean, I would think a big
major corporation would have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity Good honest company do something
like that because that would be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cheating and dishonest Poisoning their
citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, come on big pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So if you if you did not go out and
vote you can't bitch about what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: in Florida But if you voted in Florida and
I'm sorry you did not get your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: rights there Alaska and Washington DC,
however Congratulations, like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what are we gonna say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of cut you off I was gonna say
unless for some reason they're listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to this and they voted against it then Go
fuck yourself Nobody's tallied up how many
[SPEAKER_00]: times I said the f-word on so many
episodes So whoever was paying attention
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go math that up for me and
we're gonna discontinue that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna stop doing it because I
haven't said that in quite a long Time on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show, so it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody let me know what I owe and I'll
pay it I had you on two for one episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I Don't remember which one or
when or where anything so it's dreadful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: He always listened to the show and remind
me of funny stuff that I said so count up
[SPEAKER_00]: those F words What else was I gonna say
Washington DC our nation's capital now has
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized cannabis Why doesn't the rest of
the nation just follow suit with what the
[SPEAKER_00]: capital is done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess it
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they'll change some of the their
habits like while they're up there doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do instead of just droning on
and be like yo, bro I think that these
[SPEAKER_00]: GMOs are a crock of shit Can I get an eye
and then everyone will be like yeah This
[SPEAKER_01]: just made a getting a smoking a joint in
front of the White House photo op a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier Well, that's a there's actually I
was at Garden of the Gods and I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw a sign that remind you Reminded you
that that's a state park and you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: bring your cannabis there Yeah,
because it's still federal land so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure that that White House land is
federal land and you can't have your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis there Yeah, if you if you go to a
state park right now in Colorado people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not from Colorado This is a
random we did not prepare this part at all
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not if you were in a state park
in Colorado like Red Rocks is a state park
[SPEAKER_00]: Most the reservoirs like the Pueblo
reservoir all the big reservoirs where
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd want to go hang out Most of the cool
shit is a state park.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot take you you can I mean you can
they're not stopping everybody checking it
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do but we're not gonna say we do
but you can take not encouraging It's
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal to actually have cannabis at a
state park So yeah, even if it's legal in
[SPEAKER_00]: DC smoking a joint at the White House is
still gonna be a little sketchy Although
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Snoop Dogg snoop claims that
he smoked that Weed at the White House
[SPEAKER_00]: there and also big shout out to Willie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know Willie smoked at the way the White
House so All right, so Clinton smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: something there Monica Lewinsky smoked
something there She just turned 50
[SPEAKER_00]: recently and there were pictures of her
online I'm not gonna comment on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures, but that did happen Doesn't that
kind of make you feel old I wasn't gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go there I that did come to cross my mind,
but all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about Jesse and I were
talking about building a room A couple
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes back and we're talking about
planning your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about selecting your space Being
a responsible grower on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk more about building and
setting up your grow we're gonna discuss
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tents a little bit or those hydro
huts or whatever you want to call and
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we have enough time, we're
already 15 minutes in if we have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: time I will try to tackle that $500 grow
room question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be a challenge, but Basically
do everything that we're doing to go much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller We don't even get to pots and soil
and stuff on the stuff that I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: Written and we've got five pages of stuff
typed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is gonna be a lot We wrapped up
the last episode with the talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding how much light to use in your
space and we kind of talked about Where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna hang the lights and where
you're gonna my phone is making noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a poor podcast move right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's already No, yeah, it was on
silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that was All right Yeah,
talking about we're gonna hang the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: how you're gonna fit the humidity We
talked a little bit about bringing fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: air into the room so now let's kind of
talk about building a room which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of helpful because Jesse has a lot of
experience in this Now you need to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean grow space that allows you to
control the light cycles the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day the temperature during the
night and you need to control the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's also ideal to have a Lot of
control over the air going in and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow space if you're using an extra
bedroom or a closet You'll have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: walls already built, but you'll need to
work around the existing room Jesse was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about working in a brick building
or a brick facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ask I don't want to know but he
was talking about it's 150 years old and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's brick and that's got to suck because
you don't have a thing to screw shit into
[SPEAKER_00]: Bricks crumble if you hit them with a
hammer and try to put nails into them shit
[SPEAKER_00]: can go really wrong If you move one brick
now, you've got that unstable wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I'm ranting about a brick If
you've got an open area like a garage or a
[SPEAKER_00]: basement or maybe Jesse's brick area
You're gonna need to build a room You
[SPEAKER_00]: can't you could just hang lights up in
your garage or in that basement It's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot easier if you build a room or set
up a free prefabricated grow hut because
[SPEAKER_00]: that just gives you actually control over
it your environment and an environment
[SPEAKER_00]: simple reflection and Trapping the light
and having it reflect around makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: light up to 30% more efficient is what I
read in a couple of books one said 21 said
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 How about we'll settle on 25% more
efficient and if you're running a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light, that's 250 watts basically of
Efficiency that you're going to not lose
[SPEAKER_00]: by having more reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just putting in a good designed room is
already saving you money And increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: buds because like we talked about on
another show the light is the main
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient for your plants It's not what you
pour in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what you feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the light so Where are we
let's let's actually get into building a
[SPEAKER_00]: room I was looking at all kinds of stuff
and trying to figure out how to do this I
[SPEAKER_00]: just decided let's kind of build a four
light room We're gonna act like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: building it either in a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got plenty of room or the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got plenty of room or maybe in a
warehouse Sorry about the cops guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been taking dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's build a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need four 1000 watt lights an Air
conditioner a way to remove the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and a way to draw in fresh air So let's
choose like I said, we're gonna do the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement or a garage or something like
that that we want to build a four light
[SPEAKER_00]: room I want to build a room that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is this room?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I just say eight by eight
because two by fours come in eight foot
[SPEAKER_00]: sections, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two by three or whatever we decide to use
a two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can get them in tins,
too Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but most of us aren't gonna have a
ten foot ceiling in our basement our
[SPEAKER_00]: garage So I was gonna just stick with you
You can buy a bunch of eight by eights a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of eight foot two by fours And I
think you could set up this room in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You and I could do it in probably
five hours because we've done this enough
[SPEAKER_00]: times So if you're gonna use a grow hut or
something or a pre-made grow lab What do
[SPEAKER_00]: you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys sell grow huts at the high
over at hydro into growing supplies?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grow hut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a generic brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the grow lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a grow labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the generic brand is different than
the Grow labs, I've never seen one but we
[SPEAKER_01]: can get a really good price on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and they're just basic,
you know, I use the grow labs That's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to grow lab 120s or something like
that or the five by fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are sweet same thing Throw a
thousand watt light in there and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also make a ten by ten one which
would work perfectly For what we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be we're gonna Basically build an
eight by eight version of that ten by six
[SPEAKER_00]: ten by ten feet by ten feet by six high I
think or seven high we're just gonna make
[SPEAKER_01]: an eight by eight by eight room and one of
the best ways to build a room You know
[SPEAKER_01]: even like a big huge warehouse what they
do is essentially they build a gigantic
[SPEAKER_01]: grow hut out of two by fours and You know
drywall and everything they'll build a
[SPEAKER_01]: room inside of a room even in like the
vertical commercial lettuce farms and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that that's They start with
these cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know You need to you know,
sometimes looking at a ten by ten a girl
[SPEAKER_01]: hut they're kind of expensive but so is
building a ten by ten room, right and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not a And if you can build a ten by
ten, you can build this a by room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the tools and everything She'll
build us a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't have I mean I've got basic
skills but for me buying the ten by ten
[SPEAKER_00]: hut and snapping those pieces together is
so much easier for me and If something
[SPEAKER_00]: were to go wrong in your grow the thing
comes down in an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have everything down concealed
in one hour Move it to another spot and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it back up hopefully in another hour
with those girl huts And if you're like
[SPEAKER_01]: working in a garage or a big open
basement, I mean, you know, it's just If
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to expand and stuff like that
There's a lot of good reasons to have
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple rooms when it comes to pest
control Equipment failure and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, you know, it's it's good
to double up I agree completely if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs over in this room or if you have an
equipment Like you said if the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner fails in this room,
it didn't fail in every room It only
[SPEAKER_00]: failed in one light or four lights worth
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only murdered 30 plants instead of a
hundred Alright, so I'm glad Jesse said
[SPEAKER_00]: that part about building a room within a
room He comes in handy sometimes because
[SPEAKER_00]: most of what I wrote was about building a
room inside of a room I was gonna say
[SPEAKER_00]: frame out of eight by eight room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice and tall I was gonna say try
to leave as much headroom as you can but
[SPEAKER_00]: most of us are gonna be in a basement or
garage so we'll be limited on space and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I said if you can use the full eight
foot two by fours you're in good luck so
[SPEAKER_00]: frame out your eight by eight by eight
room wherever you're working and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I kind of start getting into
detail since Jesse kind of I'm so glad you
[SPEAKER_00]: said build a room inside of a room most of
what I wrote is build a room inside of a
[SPEAKER_01]: room even like Big like restaurants and
old buildings and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they you know, make it sanitary
Make it look all nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just build a shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called over framing All right,
so over frame yourself a nice room All
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got an eight by eight room just
framed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to frame it like super
Rigidly secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need a couple of cross beams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah 24 inch studs every 24 inches So have
Jesse or I stand every 24 inches is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to stud every 24 inches Plan for
a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you guys forget doors the hydro
shops sell I don't know if you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: this yet, but I've seen this at plenty of
them Okay, it's like a sticker you stick
[SPEAKER_00]: it right on your on the mylar We're gonna
talk or not the mylar the poly we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about later And then use a razor and
you unzip the zipper and as you unzip it
[SPEAKER_00]: You just follow your razor right along
with it and cut a hole in the poly and now
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a zippered door Do not unzip it
before you stick it on Has that happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're just gonna move on because we
don't want to make fun of your customer
[SPEAKER_00]: that did that You're gonna need to put
some beams across the top to hang your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got this eight by eight
building Just just a frame Studs every 24
[SPEAKER_00]: inches maybe a couple across because
you're gonna hang some equipment the Roof
[SPEAKER_01]: beams well Depending on if you go all the
way to the to the ceiling if you don't go
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to the ceiling Just stand your
don't lay them down stand your two by
[SPEAKER_01]: fours up on the skinny edge Get you some
metal clamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's groom to the the top of two walls
and it'll help support the brace
[SPEAKER_01]: everything You can hang lights from it all
kinds of neat shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we brought Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he's here That's why you paying
the big bucks So once everything's framed
[SPEAKER_00]: up You can insulate the room with the blue
insulation boards if you want to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: more soundproof and more have more stable
temps I don't find that to be too
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary if you're in a basement if
you're in the garage Maybe because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get colder in the winter and hotter
in the summer But the basement like we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about stays fairly cool most of the
time Some people choose to use plywood or
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of board on the walls Whatever
you want is cool build it how you like at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point But once you've decided on the
walls and insulation That's when we hang
[SPEAKER_00]: we call it poly or panda film Poly is
basically plastic sheeting that's white on
[SPEAKER_00]: one side and black on the other Now you
hang the white side on the inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and the black side on the outside of
the room It'll the white will keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection of your light in there and give
you more efficiency You need to cover up
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole room the walls the floor and the
ceiling and seal it up with tape Seal up
[SPEAKER_00]: any spots where bugs can get in any spots
where light can get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be a little fortress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's Your own private little room
you want to seal that shit up and the more
[SPEAKER_01]: time you take and the tighter you get all
the plastic and everything there's less of
[SPEAKER_01]: a spot for Bugs to get and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, take your time with this take your
time with it If you can if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of overlap everywhere,
there's some kind of gap That's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea when you're putting your staples in
put down a little square of duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then the staple Yeah,
because that'll help from the poly tearing
[SPEAKER_00]: it or also keep the staple in a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also Go back and take a little bit
of silicone caulking And Stick that right
[SPEAKER_01]: over the staple I had to make sure I got
that bill in there You don't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: your cock out in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right So now you've basically built a
little grow hut like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what we're gonna talk about now
works in the grow huts and it translates
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of translates to if you're just
working with the bedroom also if you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't built a room The main difference
is you won't have the buffer zone around
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow area If you're in a bedroom,
you'll need to vent out of the room or the
[SPEAKER_00]: house without anybody noticing The room
that we've built inside of the rooms gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you more privacy and I feel like a little
bit more control should we Go over a
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom how to vent out a window real
seats snazzy like real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I talk a little bit about it Yeah,
we can talk about it and if when I get to
[SPEAKER_01]: it later on we'll just skip it later,
okay, so crack your window open Half inch
[SPEAKER_01]: inch kind of depends On how much air flow
you need through it And then screw it shut
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least screw it to where it can't be
opened any further and you do that by Real
[SPEAKER_01]: gently running a nice three inch screw
through the most people have vinyl windows
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the the inside track of where the
window goes up and down that'll hold the
[SPEAKER_01]: window shut keep someone from ripping it
open Then you take your window blinds get
[SPEAKER_01]: you a nice new set of mini blinds cheap
ones Throw that down close them so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, no light can go through Maybe
leave them open a quarter inch at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom air will still suck through it
pretty pretty good And then take panda
[SPEAKER_01]: film put the white side to the outside of
the window Staple it over that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: take you a piece of plywood Screw it up
over the wall and you can cut holes and
[SPEAKER_01]: mount mount fans on there and all your
duct tape And everything there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you can use one window as an
intake and one windows and exhaust Have
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever done the thing where?
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the blinds up just like you say
you I would close the window or leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: open just a little bit Okay, we got to
leave it open for what we're doing on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry too many ideas in my head you leave
the half inch gap and Then you build
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a box around the window So you
take some plywood and you make like three
[SPEAKER_00]: inch deep little square around the like an
inch around the window and then you put a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of plywood over that and Then you
can put all your ducting in that plywood
[SPEAKER_00]: and it almost looks like you could put
like a Christmas light Or a candle light
[SPEAKER_00]: or something in there and it looks like
somebody's home all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just makes it look like you got a light
Like it's the room and you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: use that as ducting and shit too now
because it's open I did one I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck a Christmas light in there a yellow
one and it reflected off all the plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything enough to You know,
you could just flip it on his little timer
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything and then now you've got a
window open and It looks like somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a light on in there and it looks
like it's just part of the normal Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you're I had no idea why we would
need to be that secretive You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's mostly I'm not worried is worried
about the police's I am about the thieves
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually heard a story about some
thieves getting into somebody's air They
[SPEAKER_00]: went in through their house through the
air conditioning duct and we're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants while the people were home
Wow, they found out and I shouldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: be talking about this because now whatever
but The people found out their plants Were
[SPEAKER_00]: being stolen because of the cops knocked
on the door and found kids running out
[SPEAKER_00]: their backyard with pot plants Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that story ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bailed on that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Scary shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I hope my story about building
the box around the window makes sense It's
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of had a vague idea of how to do
that in my head I was thinking too many
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take a just shape the size of the
window you add an inch square so now if
[SPEAKER_00]: your windows 24 by 24 to make a 25 by 25
square piece of plywood and then you make
[SPEAKER_00]: a Freaking box out of it, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a half box So it's only you only need
it three inches deep make a little tray
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put that up against the window
And then you can put a curtain and just
[SPEAKER_00]: make it look like it's a real window Yeah,
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can math that out your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a bunch of shit That's not on all
my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just messing with my brain,
man Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I on all these papers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate I hate sloppy windows I've actually
seen a few houses around town and drive
[SPEAKER_01]: around you're like There's one I know what
that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's actually two I can drive to
right now and be like grow house Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always see the metal halide in the
attic All right So hang that poly real
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully like Jesse said take your time
with the poly you're this is the building
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room These are your walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't build your house walls all
shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your plant room nice Cover the
whole room seal it up seal any spots where
[SPEAKER_00]: shit can get in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically you got that little grow hut
We're talking about a bedroom I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: already did most of the part I'm talking
about More privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you got the room built and sealed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna use a bedroom Make sure to
clean and dust the bedroom first get your
[SPEAKER_01]: liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's definitely on my list of shit
Cover the windows where the light can get
[SPEAKER_00]: in or get out cover any cracks if you got
cracks in the walls cover those Cover all
[SPEAKER_00]: your walls in the bedroom with reflective
material the panda film works in a bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: also Pull up the carpet if you have that
option cover the floor if possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: right here I wrote I like a pond liner for
my floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to Get the pond liner about three
to four inches up the wall all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: around the room So if you do accidentally
flood your resin that room or you spill a
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket or something, that's cool You just
got a pond liner there to catch it all and
[SPEAKER_01]: in the doorway there To help keep the
doorway all sealed up just cut you a door
[SPEAKER_01]: two by four as wide as your doorway stand
it up on the outside and Screw it in place
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that's a place to staple your
pond liner too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it turns a whole little bedroom
into A pond, you know, you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: to step up when you go in and out but you
know big deal I like the way you did that
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz I did it kind of a shitty way in my my
newest build It works, but I didn't do it
[SPEAKER_01]: that smooth A nice little air seal if you
put it real tight and everything put a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of foam in there and that's
something we're gonna talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about because some of us are gonna have to
use that crevice underneath the door to
[SPEAKER_00]: let air in yeah, that's actually a pretty
good spot if for some of us and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I'm talking about is Under
ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah this I mean there's I'm just trying
to throw out because there's so many ways
[SPEAKER_00]: you could use I mean and so much that
different scenarios if you walked into
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a four-bedroom house if we
walked into all four bedrooms and tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: build a grow room in it We'd have to deal
with different obstacles in every single
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each room would have different shit to
deal with That rooms only got a window on
[SPEAKER_00]: that side that room You can't mess with
the window because it's right up against
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighbor's house If you exhaust out
there, you're gonna be blown into the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor's window basically, so there'd be
some obstacles Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever you are, you're gonna have to
deal with some shit Everything we're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying is just kind of kind of hopefully
gonna work for what we're doing So now
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got this clean room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we've got a hut that's sealed
up We're gonna add so you get your eight
[SPEAKER_00]: by eight by eight room It's all panda
filmed or you've got a ten by ten grow hut
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever something similar Now this is
where you want to add an intake and an
[SPEAKER_00]: outtake I talked in that last episode a
lot about how Important it is to vent you
[SPEAKER_00]: the air in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those inline style fans or blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the vortex Vortex has always been
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The can fan is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more expensive,
but they're adjustable speed and dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are reliable Those green hard hydro
farm blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work, but they're loud Yeah,
they're really loud and they're the green
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro farm inline boosters or junk All
right, yeah Don't waste your money on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse works at a hydro shop And I was not
gonna bash any brand but since he works
[SPEAKER_01]: there and has to order from them We'll let
him go ahead and talk shit There's a
[SPEAKER_01]: reason they sell So many refurbished ones
of those that's a lot of growth stores who
[SPEAKER_01]: get the Hydro farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just better shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all of what he says is allegedly and
I am NOT responsible for that I like for
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna build we need an 8-inch blower
I'm gonna say get a can fan or a vortex
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't buy one of the green hydro farm
ones get a If you can afford the can fan
[SPEAKER_01]: get that the vortex is ideal next so that
yeah the hydro farm blowers are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the boosters The ones that go in the
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no matter who makes them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all crap I think and fans isn't
bad but okay, it's It's not a primary fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a booster on the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Yeah, if you get the right
blower, you don't need the booster So add
[SPEAKER_00]: that uh, let's see Where were we 8-inch
blower attach the blower to the framing
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it fairly high in the room
Depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys might need to do this in
the dead center of the room Some of you
[SPEAKER_00]: may need to do it off to a corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to get it high I think it's
better to get the heat high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to dump it out of the room
high I like to do everything high All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, so now this is when you need to
decide if you're gonna use a vented hoods
[SPEAKER_00]: or open hoods Vented hoods are the ones
just for the people that are new with this
[SPEAKER_00]: your life Reflectors and hoods vented ones
mean they have glass on the bottom and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sealed and your ducting will
attach to it And the light will be moved
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the grow and not dropping down
onto your plants If you have open hoods,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to have more air
conditioning But you don't have to have as
[SPEAKER_00]: much ducting So that's when you need to
think about what you got to do you get
[SPEAKER_01]: more value for your for your light that
way but Air conditioning is expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to vented style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty much the industry
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say yeah unless you're in I've
actually seen a couple of huge rooms that
[SPEAKER_00]: just dump AC at ridiculous levels and
Yeah, but if you're supplementing co2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you can't be exhausting a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it takes a little bit more work And
if you're really cool kids, you got the
[SPEAKER_01]: gavitas or the nanoluxes or something like
that Oh, yeah, those gavitas you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: duct those so then you're gonna have okay
So if you're using gavitas, you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to use more air conditioning a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if you're Using open hoods
and you're trying for the ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: situation we're doing you can just attach
a carbon filter To your 8 inch blower and
[SPEAKER_00]: now you've pretty much finished the
extraction but if you're using Make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you use the carbon filter also if that's
what I want to add make sure using the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter on the extraction fan Sure
crop is gonna stink like about week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be able to smell everything I
just hit week five in the middle of week
[SPEAKER_00]: five in a room and that uh That gorilla
glue number four is a stinky little bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god So if you do use vented hoods
you got to run ducting We're running four
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in this design So I would do it
kind of like this, but i'm gonna take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little drink of this drink first right now
taking a drink And that was well deserved
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're building This room with four
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a large carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 39 by 8 Carbon filter they have
those available right now at hydro indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing supplies Then I would take that 38
by 8 inch carb 39 by 8 inch carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use an 8 inch y duct that goes
into two 6 inch ducts So now my eight just
[SPEAKER_00]: went to two sixes and I would use the y to
run the ducting to two lights on each side
[SPEAKER_00]: so I would have light 1a light 2a and then
light 1b light 2b on opposite sides and
[SPEAKER_00]: then use another y duct more ducting and
then a y duct to bring them back together
[SPEAKER_00]: and then attach that y duct and the 8 inch
blower Uh I wrote something weird there
[SPEAKER_00]: attach that y and the 8 inch blower and
the blower send the air out of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I wrote doesn't make sense,
but attach that y duct to the blower And
[SPEAKER_00]: then send the air see I already have
something wrong here because you should
[SPEAKER_00]: have carbon filter blower is the way it
should go So it should be carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: blower ducting or a carbon filter blower y
Ducting light light y and then out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah is where it should go I type
something different, but I must have just
[SPEAKER_01]: been high at that time That'd be a good
spot for a booster fan That right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end there would be the perfect spot So in
this case we're running it out of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: hut or out of this 8 by 8 room that we
built or if you're doing the bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you got to build that little
wall and run it out of that duct or that
[SPEAKER_00]: little box that we made there That was a
good burp I'm glad I got that one off the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone In some cases you're going to
need to run the ducting out of the house
[SPEAKER_00]: or to another room booster fans come in
handy there try to keep The the ducting as
[SPEAKER_00]: short and straight as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a lot of bends in your
ducting and you don't want excessive long
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting Also, if you can hang your carbon
filter from the ceiling Yeah, because all
[SPEAKER_00]: of your heat and stale air is gonna go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully air moves just like water so you
know if you got a Pump it all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: the ceiling from the floor, you know,
that's just Stealing energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go and he rises so put that
thing up there And you're yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it won't suck hot air stinks more
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, that's very true stick it on the
ceiling And your carbon filter will work
[SPEAKER_00]: better if you keep the humidity at a more
acceptable level get it closer to 50 get
[SPEAKER_00]: away from that 70% Like I've seen a couple
of guys in their flower rooms at 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity because they say it makes the bud
sticky You'll make your bud moldy is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna get bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen flower rooms with zero percent
humidity So much good old southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just gonna say it's Colorado bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look at me like that And then your
carbon filter pretty much quits working at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, you need some some moisture to
keep that charcoal active.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got an exhaust set up
now you need air in Depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might make a four inch hole six inches
from the corners and six inches off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground So imagine there's the corner of
the room I would go six inches in and six
[SPEAKER_00]: inches up and make a four inch hole and
then on the opposite side of that corner
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same thing and that'll give you
eight four inch holes for fresh air Then I
[SPEAKER_00]: go and get those HEPA filters from Lowe's
They're just little square sheets and I
[SPEAKER_00]: staple those over the holes to keep any
dirt bugs Freaking dog hair hippie hair
[SPEAKER_00]: keep all that shit out of the grow room
with those HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work pretty well I use dryer vents to
cover and prevent light leaks right on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put those on the outside To where or you
can put them on the inside too if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to but I like them on the outside They
just look smoother, but you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside may work because now the lights
coming this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna get in there If you're
using them for an intake, don't forget to
[SPEAKER_01]: take the little flapper out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I've actually heard one going What is
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You could replace the small holes
with one big hole and you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: blower in there If you do have something
bringing air in make sure that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than the exhaust fan You want to
suck out?
[SPEAKER_00]: More than what you're bringing in you want
to create a negative pressure in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room You want it to feel if you have a
real door if it's in a bedroom when you
[SPEAKER_00]: open the door You want that you want to
turn the knob and you want the door to fly
[SPEAKER_00]: open on its own That's how you know,
you got enough pressure to grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: positive pressure That's negative sucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah Yeah, I was actually thinking of
a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just in so the door would have been
yeah We'll catch up we'll get you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same show well I'm doing episode 39.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what number you're on So now
we've guys I wonder what's gonna happen on
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 42 Because Jesse just jumped to
the future on me it clicked in my brain a
[SPEAKER_00]: second late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like wait, man We got to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so you can replace all those
holes with a big blower You've got fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: air being pulled in when the exhaust fan
pulls out stale air and humidity out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and out of the house What does
that even mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell I was lit when I wrote some
of these notes and it got late So we got
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air coming in When the exhaust fan
pulls the stale air and humidity out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room So you can add an air conditioner
to bring in fresh air also You might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to bring in enough air under the
bedroom door if you're doing this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom I Had a perfect little girl when I
first started off that was in a bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had the blower going over one line I
had a six inch blower going I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: over two lights and sucking that straight
out of the room and I hung the Carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter in the ceiling and I just let the
fresh air come right under the door and I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like it was enough air Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like it was sufficient in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get stifled or anything in there
So that space under the door guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be useful you need fresh air coming
in so if you're building this big 8x8 room
[SPEAKER_00]: cut some holes in there or add a blower if
you're using an 8 inch blower out You can
[SPEAKER_00]: use a 4 or a 6 inch blower and I think and
you'll be just fine And even if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running a sealed room, I hate seeing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little more advanced stuff,
but even sealed rooms need to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to inject fresh air You know even
if you don't use it but once a week or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, it's you still need
to recycle your air every now And then
[SPEAKER_01]: pumping co2 into air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about a Control a closed
environment agriculture room where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is sealed up The only air that
goes in the room is co2 that's
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemented with the co2 tank We'll talk
a little bit about that in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants actually breathe co2 and
let out oxygen But I think just pumping
[SPEAKER_00]: all that co2 in there They are gonna need
some oxygen your roots need oxygen your
[SPEAKER_00]: micro life and it gets stale Yeah,
yeah, so I agree you have to put some
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in that closed room somehow And
just use those HIPAA filters and filter
[SPEAKER_00]: your air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sell those shroom things the
shroom covers I'm a big fan of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always thought they were a little
overpriced So I've just stuck with the
[SPEAKER_00]: HIPAA filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't argue with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so We sell a much bigger intake
filter that's similar to a carbon filter
[SPEAKER_01]: and You know, it's Not applicable in all
situations, but um It's very reasonably
[SPEAKER_01]: priced for what it is the lifespan It's
just touch over a hundred and it does some
[SPEAKER_00]: serious filtering so you can bring air
from outside Into your grow essentially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you filter it with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's worth a ton of money Looks like a
gigantic canner can in air filter for like
[SPEAKER_01]: a freaking f22 Raptor or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I wonder God imagine when you're done
with that thing you go dump it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking oops five dollars Fucking
landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just called it was over I'm glad you go
dump it in the landfill and you set it
[SPEAKER_00]: down I'm just picturing like some sort of
Breaking Bad desert is where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: watching somebody in my mind dump it and
like throws it down in the desert and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these bugs And like imagine all the crazy
shit that's gonna come out cuz you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: blower attached to it sucking Every bug
that flies by is gonna go and just get
[SPEAKER_00]: sucked into that and get stuck in your
trap now
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go we're coming for you
Biological warfare we're coming for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna try to I've got like
three more pages of stuff typed out I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to edit out the f-word so I'm
done with paying five dollars for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already declared that earlier in the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cool I was just so daydreaming and
thinking about like where would this thing
go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't like a boy was a picture
in me and you doing it I'm picturing like
[SPEAKER_00]: some shady grower with this big gigantic
vent cleaner He's just rolling it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of his truck in the desert
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, oh imagine what comes out
of that dude hair It's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: anything pretty All kinds of weird molds
and danders and pollens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh so gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right That was one thing when I was
actually researching it because Before we
[SPEAKER_01]: got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh This would be great for
protection from outdoor Yeah Amateurs
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor amateur pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah or him And I've got a male that might
blow soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just reminded me that I did not move it
earlier He's in a shitty spot if he goes I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want that to happen premature Yeah,
he's in yeah, I don't need him to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in a bad spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so guys We've been ranting
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna try to get back on track for a
little bit We got 15 more minutes or so
[SPEAKER_00]: before everyone's gonna get a DD can
already happen to us Since we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang up some lights guys in this
room We have an eight by eight footprint
[SPEAKER_00]: and four lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we can use a four by four area
for each light It's gonna be bright in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want divide the room into
perfect quarters Find the center for each
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter hang your lights so they're
centered in the corners or the quarters
[SPEAKER_00]: not corners You want them centered in the
quarters?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you got a four by four
section with the light perfectly above it
[SPEAKER_00]: and every four by four space has a light
right above it Jesse's doing math on how
[SPEAKER_00]: many lumens and how many watts per square
foot that yes, it's impressive You could
[SPEAKER_00]: do 600 while lights in the setup if you
wanted thousands are the way to go in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think That's my professional opinion if
you've got the electricity and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: building this room put thousands in
there's All right, I use those little uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: so 64 square feet obviously That's simple
math I'm all stoned work a calculator
[SPEAKER_01]: Always divide things the wrong way,
that's a 62 Watts per square foot and what
[SPEAKER_00]: would be your recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Hydro shop expert?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really healthy walk Per square
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is gonna be a healthy room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Ryan, you've got a room kind of like
this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good job You might have taken some
advice from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no Tierra Rojo 120 watts per square
foot Yeah that indoor acre and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about a spot called the indoor
acre is what is that place is amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a mile and a half of plumbing
in there just for the hydro kit All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're hanging our lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the corner the core the the
center of the quarters of the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a lot of editing on the
show guys were dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use those little eye hooks I
sell at Lowe's they're just screws With
[SPEAKER_00]: the little circle at the end of it
basically screw that into the ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw it directly into the ceiling beams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you get a stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there will only be studs there I
mean have mylar or a star plastic or a
[SPEAKER_00]: stud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you get it in there Yeah,
if you're in a bedroom though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go right on I forgot about the
bedroom actually got a quick trick for
[SPEAKER_01]: that and it helps you center your lights
Take two eight foot Two by fours screw
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the ceiling then you push your
lights anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always know you hit a stud Yeah,
I need to do that in one one area Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked at a place where the lights were
I worked for two companies in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: building ironically And at the first
company I didn't help set anything up And
[SPEAKER_01]: all the lights were hung from a floating
grid ceiling big old Raptor hoods With
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny plastic hooks is absolutely
like just super dangerous dumbass move But
[SPEAKER_01]: when I went to work for the other company
I got paid to do a two by four structure
[SPEAKER_01]: all through that could support a couple
gorillas so Guys be safe when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: building stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about not being that asshole
that burns down the house Also,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be the guy that takes down the
bedroom on accident if you're renting
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to pay for whatever you
mess up All right I like those little
[SPEAKER_00]: light hangers to hang my lights the
ratchet style ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them hangers All four lights screw
in your bulbs and wipe off the bulbs when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done wipe them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use like a It's a thing that you
should be cleaning your drums with it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a microfiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, clean it off with that sunglass
stuff Yeah sunglass stuff exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: scratches in that uh in in the bulb or any
dust or dirt on there or any oil from your
[SPEAKER_00]: finger on there any little thing that
close to the bulb is gonna definitely kill
[SPEAKER_01]: lumens make sure your bulb is screwed in
completely yeah, that's and all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: connections are all Pushed in tight on
your ballast as well So screw in your
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs wipe it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's tight Run the ducting from
the blower To the Y duct to each light
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the other Y out of your grow room
and then secure all of those ductings with
[SPEAKER_00]: tape There's gonna be a lot of pressure on
the ducts an 8-inch blower puts out a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of pressure It may be a good idea also to
grab a fan speed controller You plug that
[SPEAKER_00]: in and then you plug your fan into that
and you can actually your blower your
[SPEAKER_00]: 8-inch Vortex blower you can adjust how
much by percentage of from it only works
[SPEAKER_00]: about 50% is as low as I think it goes But
then you can go from 50 all the way to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wanting to keep a little
humidity in the room turn it down You can
[SPEAKER_00]: get it down to you know, 50% humidity turn
it down to 70% It'll help you out That's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually how I run it in one space at
about 70% all the time and some of the can
[SPEAKER_01]: fans come with The little three speed
switch on the cord already adjusted to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that may be beneficial and the
hyper fans
[SPEAKER_00]: When I upgrade it's time for some of those
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got ducting you got lights on
it's kind of starting to look like a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room You got to hang a couple fans on the
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put fans Right above the expected
height of your plants Like if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are gonna get five feet tall
put a fan at five and a half feet Right
[SPEAKER_00]: between the fan can or the light canopy
with a damn lot of words right between the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant canopy And the lights is kind of
where I like a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, keep the air moving You don't want
the air to get stale plants suck up the
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 in the room quickly They can use the
co2 around them super quickly and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: got to move the air So there's more co2
for them to use up Yeah, we're 51 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: in go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we gonna say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you throw maybe a box fan on the
floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like a box fan on the floor super low
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um If you're on a budget the box fan is
awesome If you have more of a budget I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend a carbon filter with like
a 6-inch blower on top of it just dead
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the center of the room put some
ducting off the blower up to the ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: and just move that air from the floor back
up to the ceiling and you're picking up
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 off the ground and putting it back up
to fall back down onto your plants nice
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's just differences in
budgets If you've got a low but if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got 30 bucks by a fan if you got 160 by a
blower and a filter Yeah, just kind of or
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's gonna be closer to 260 I
guess that blower is gonna be 120 130 your
[SPEAKER_00]: filters are gonna be expensive You know,
I've watched everything escalate in price
[SPEAKER_00]: since I've been Expanding my grows and
since Colorado has been getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular Everything has just gone up in
price and it's not even a competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: raise It's a gouging raise and we I can
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Man remember buying a light in like 2002
And keep your head down at the store try
[SPEAKER_01]: not to be noticed man I swear I paid like
five six hundred bucks for my first light
[SPEAKER_01]: setup and it's just a magnetic 400 watt
like Nothing special whatsoever So but
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else I feel like has got more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Lighting is the only only thing and
actually I guess it's just because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so many newer options, but basic lighting
I feel like it's gotten cheaper Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you would you'd buy shit and it
would just die on you and else Seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: last at least a year or two and if it if
it doesn't you can take it back All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone 52 minutes My next part is all
about hanging up the ballast and
[SPEAKER_00]: electronics and making the board that I
like to hang my stuff on I think I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: leave everybody hanging and we're gonna do
that part of the next episode And I got a
[SPEAKER_01]: trick to help you take better pictures
when you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Oh, Jesse's gonna help us out with some
tricks When can you come back and do
[SPEAKER_00]: another episode bro probably next week?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah We'll try to get him back for part
three of our growing our building our
[SPEAKER_00]: growing Episode I'm gonna give a huge huge
super huge shout out to high grow indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Jesse's here So I'm kissing his ass
a little bit, but seriously, they helped
[SPEAKER_00]: me out a lot They sponsor this show and
without them I couldn't do some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I do Do you have any idea when
the next growers meeting is gonna be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I'm really bad with dates,
but I know He's one of those guys that can
[SPEAKER_00]: build you a freaking farm in ten minutes
But if you give him math or a calendar,
[SPEAKER_00]: he just gets all this like look on his
face of like Can I hit actually great with
[SPEAKER_01]: math I just can't ever do my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Just got a new phone so He stepped up
into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so he's looking through his phone to
find out when the next next meeting is at
[SPEAKER_00]: high grow indoor growing supplies We
gather at the back of the shop and we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing it's gonna be Friday the
21st Friday the 21st of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, November November because we can't
go back in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Well It's my favorite movie ever Back to
the future trilogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, I'm gonna have to get free
that day No matter what happens because
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are all gonna come say the date
again November 21st, November 21st.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Friday at high grow indoor growing
supplies about six six fifteen Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah We did it four to eight last time and
kind of decided the two hours when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: open was kind of lame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Okay It's a little hint there We're
gonna have I Don't know it's awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're gonna have barbecue pork we were
think about doing turkey, but Everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: got plenty of turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be that asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true But we have some good
smoked pork From probably my dad will do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been smoking meat for many years
Jesse's dad is a cool son of a bitch and I
[SPEAKER_01]: am going to get Awesome vegetarian option
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's much appreciated and just for
people who need to eat their damn veggies
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat your vegetables guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a vegetarian for oh my god over
ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember exactly when I know I was
a vegetarian in 2002 for sure I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember before that when I started but
there was an event that happened and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my friends I hadn't seen in a while
made fun of me for being a vegetarian at
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnaroo and the first Bonnaroo was 2002
so I'm gonna Vegetarian since then and
[SPEAKER_00]: since I started eating better I eat I try
to eat a little better and better and
[SPEAKER_00]: better all the time But the more I take
care of my body the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eat your vegetables guys That's a don't
eat as much meat, you know, even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: eat meat America eats way way too much of
it and try to eat food quit eating like
[SPEAKER_00]: food product Like processed shit that kind
of resembles food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that you want food if it's
got like 17 ingredients in it That's not
[SPEAKER_00]: food anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Look for the fewer ingredients and
the easier they are to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah all those ictoses and extoses and
Oodla maidsens none of that shit is good
[SPEAKER_00]: for you We're kind of rambling now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we wrap up a podcast and we'll
look forward to talking to you guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: About seven days.
