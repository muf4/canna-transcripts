Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm honored to have our guest with
us sitting in front of me is a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: guest, a frequent guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many episodes has he been on lately,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our buddy, white Mike over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking good on Mike too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sitting to my left is a good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually Doug's medical marijuana
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My good buddy, Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we had some crowd noise for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming, Doug.
[SPEAKER_04]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am his caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our topic for the show is going to be
the way that different ways of consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: your cannabinoids, the way of using your
cannabis, the way taking your medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: differently affects your mind and your
body and maybe even your spirit a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get there, I'm going to brag
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've been talking about the spot
dispensary a whole bunch on this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I spend 132 hours per week there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ish.
Ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great spot to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great spot to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, yesterday we were wrapping up
work and the boss walked up to me and he
[SPEAKER_01]: said mandatory meeting today, five o'clock
at the Pueblo Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I smiled and I said, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, yeah, put on your Sundays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're in the top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get there and it was the best of
Pueblo Convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our spot won the best dispensary in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the gold.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a local competition for, I think
there were 180 categories this year
[SPEAKER_00]: ranging from like best teacher to best cop
to best bakery, best lawyer, best
[SPEAKER_00]: hairdresser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won best dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a little gold plaque in the
office and we are going to be well
[SPEAKER_01]: advertised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got something to brag about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our picture's in the paper today.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a really cool picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a picture in front of the Bob
Marley mural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice big tomb picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a colorful shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight in the morning, taking a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of people that work at a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who weren't aware that you
were the best, now they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got a year to brag about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: One whole year.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get into the, into where I'm
done bragging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Rob at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the whole team at the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that does everything they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grow team, the bud team, the trimming
team, the bud tenting crew, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: managers, everybody that signs the
paychecks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody that's involved
at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like working there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are kick ass and let's keep
kicking ass you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well done everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get off the tootin' heart on horn
and advertising our work all the time on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to why we're really here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two guys have been responsible
for their medical marijuana for over five
[SPEAKER_01]: years that I can say for sure,
without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five or six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say closer to eight or 10
maybe even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a good sense of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly do not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to remember time periods by what
fish shows I went to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to a lot of fish shows you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to document.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time I was spending places.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been responsible for these guys as
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have noticed that when Mike wants to
get high, he wants to smoke some sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some Jilly Bean that we just took
dabs of or some golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when Mike needs medicine, he reaches
for the heavy CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this jar over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If either one of you would like a dab of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big CBD fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crystal clear honey oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost pure CBD that was given to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both staring at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When these guys, excuse me for the cough,
when these guys are hurting, when they
[SPEAKER_01]: feel pain, they hit me up and they're
like, do you have something extra CBD for
[SPEAKER_01]: me right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Mike's got sore hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug was an old railroad worker over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a picture of this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in jeans and a flannel shirt with a
big ass knife on his belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man looks like he is ready to do some
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you need done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure and confident Doug can handle
that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'd get it done a little better
than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, maybe depending on what it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some things that I bet I could
do, but Doug's a confident man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can work it, but he's an old railroad
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's pretty much broken all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Broken all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back, knees, all the joints, all the
joints are in bad shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that AGE has got a little bit to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, you're getting a little bit up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind if I ask you how old you are
on the show, my friend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 61 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend Doug is 61 and medical
cannabis is keeping this dude moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he hurts, we give him some CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a fan?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to kind of jump into this
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a favorite way to consume your
CBD medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite way to consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is with my little electric pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: My old lady calls it the pacifier because
it's always around my neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hanging on your neck on a lanyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know when you're going to need
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the most resin coated
things I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell that that thing has been
around the block.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it had to have a little
extra work done to it because those glass
[SPEAKER_04]: tops just don't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how you get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been a little modified there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's custom.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it works really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there at a moment's notice.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the way that seems to,
well, anytime you smoke it, we all know
[SPEAKER_04]: that that's the quickest way to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're in pain and you want
relief now, I find that's the quickest
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going to hurt most frequently?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're hanging out, what are you going
to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, this hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to grab first?
[SPEAKER_04]: My hip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your hip.
[SPEAKER_04]: My hip, my lower back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you're probably going to say,
shit, that hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second thought is going to be,
where's my vape pen, right?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long from inhaling off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, how many rips off that pen
does it take to kind of give you a little
[SPEAKER_01]: relief, to notice some easing of the pain?
[SPEAKER_04]: To notice easing of the pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like a doctor as I asked that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably within two or three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two or three rips off the vape pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not under oath or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holding the damn thing in my hand and
knowing that I'm about to take a hit off
[SPEAKER_04]: of it starts the process right there
because I know relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is on its way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is on its way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I've told you this before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your definition of what a painkiller is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that CBDs help control pain,
but marijuana in general changes your
[SPEAKER_04]: outlook on pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I agree a little more tolerable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, and what is pain relief?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what, that's what
painkillers do is they, well, we know that
[SPEAKER_04]: there, there's chemicals that go in and
shut down certain receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe the THC part is making you
forget that you hurt and helping your mind
[SPEAKER_01]: go to a better place instead of being
focused on that hip and that lower back
[SPEAKER_01]: going out on you and hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two or three rips and you start feeling
that forgetting about the pain and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of pain going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does that take?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to take two or three rips,
it's in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it gets into the hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's in the hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts right then immediately within
about two or three rips, which only takes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but so within a minute you're able to
go back to doing whatever you needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, take care of the kid, water the dog,
walk the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I see why he's got a dog that needs a
lot of walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see you walking with buddy quite
frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to buddy, the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within 30 seconds, now, if you were to
take, and I want you to ask any about,
[SPEAKER_01]: about any pharmaceuticals that I know you
take, but if you were to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical to treat that pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are the shitty side effects?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just leaned back into his chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, you got all day and we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Opioids, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the major ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywhere from the dry mouth to listless
feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: To constipation.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to give you another
medicine for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's their, that's the way they do
medicine anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they barely want to touch you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just prescribe another medication and
see how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it you on Skype?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know that I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never do that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Skyping with your doctor is not a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want my doctor to touch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you, you know, you'd like to be able
to look around the room and see the
[SPEAKER_04]: diplomas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be sitting there with just a shirt
on cause that's, you know, that's all you
[SPEAKER_04]: see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you can look around and you
like, you know, there's interaction
[SPEAKER_04]: between humans that doesn't happen on sky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially someone from your generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Skype is probably fucking fangled
technology for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to keep current, but we don't expect
you to be that current.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was periscoping earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys and Doug had no idea what was
happening for the first 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 seconds of that periscope video.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was looking around the room like,
what's he talking to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually said, I'm going to periscope
for a minute.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get back on topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within 30 seconds to a minute,
you're feeling relief from the CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: your pain and your hip isn't hurting,
but 20 minutes if you take some medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: and dude also thinks a lot for getting,
let me get so personal asking about your
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and tell me about your side
effects and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of deep compared to taking
pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see why we can't grow our own,
why they don't want us to grow our own
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine when this dude can feel better in
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: From taking a rip off of a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what you say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cannabis didn't do half of what it
does, like it would be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we discovered it right now,
it would be celebrated everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone should print that on a shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If cannabis didn't do half of what it
does, it wouldn't, it would be illegal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it, if it just worked as medicine,
if we could just replace, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton with it, like all the
pharmaceutical companies would be replaced
[SPEAKER_01]: by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about all, like there's still
use for plenty of what pharma has to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just cannabis replaces a lot of what
we're using in a pharma inappropriately
[SPEAKER_00]: for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that's taking Vicodin realizes that
we, Colorado just upped the, upped it
[SPEAKER_04]: from, I think a grade two or grade three
to a grade two narcotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no refills.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go to your doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get a hard script from them
and walk it to your pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be filled out on a certain day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, and the reason is because of the
incredible losses that we've had of life
[SPEAKER_04]: due to overdosing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on the streets everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier sometimes to find stupid drugs
and pills than it is to find weed before
[SPEAKER_01]: we had dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could find the weed, but back in the
day it, you'd run into other drugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: can't find the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually would be easier for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: To get some of this medication on the
street than it is from the doctor anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's what unfortunately results
to in heroin use when you can't get those
[SPEAKER_01]: pills anymore from your insurance company
running out or your doctor being
[SPEAKER_01]: unavailable, then you're going to have to
go and not, I know you wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an older dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a strong mind and we'll keep you
medicated with good weed, but other folks
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have good weed and a good
caregiver and a good family like yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have to go to the street and
get something because their body hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sick from not having their pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 50 states are facing an increase in
heroin use right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what why is regular
folk get hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to the doctor, the doctor throws
opiates at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take the pill until their bones not
broken anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time they're healed,
they're now addicted to whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: painkiller they were on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they got to go find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually they get cut off or it becomes
too expensive and they turn to heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some help if you need help you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feel free to tell the doctor,
no, you don't need pain pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes you need pain pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying people don't because I've
used them many, many times, but I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: like when I broke my finger, I had to
refuse pain med six different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept asking if the pain was going to get
any worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept looking at me like I was
insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that noise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a phone on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Doug's phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It vibrates stupid loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the music in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what is happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike, I want to ask you the same
question kind of that I was asking Doug
[SPEAKER_01]: since we were out of track here and I need
to find a good launching spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask what your medical condition is
that you smoke for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to go too into detail
if you don't feel like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short version is I damaged my neck and
never had cartilage in my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I need something that helps with
inflammation and nerve generated pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis works wonderfully where most
of the drugs available on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical market don't do anything
for nerve generated pain.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long, if you took a, what's your
preferred method of smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, dabbing because I'm so spoiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've currently upgraded Mike's smoking
status until about a month or two ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a heavy flower smoker in a pipe,
right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pipe and flowers or bong and flowers if I
had a bong handy, but I broke my beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: bong a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have just been piping it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then recently upgraded to an oil rig
and a nice nail and a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing a lot of dabs lately,
but flowers are still sort of my first
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike showed up with some delicious jelly
bean hash today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tastes fucking hella good and I'm
high as fuck from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, the most common way I
consume these days is with tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do three milliliters of synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a half THC half CBD, um,
tincture compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really low dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I take it sort of as a
preventative morning and evening to help
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the inflammation down before it gets
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that seems to work wonders for my
knees and for my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did those cost for a customer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 40, uh, 40 bucks before tax for a
hundred milligrams total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, that's a week's worth of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worth a meds.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 bucks for a week worth of meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get 30 doses per bottle and I'm taking
six a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even a seven day week for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five day week for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth it for 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was paying more when I was just
taking pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pills are expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you've just got a copay or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just doing a copay and it was still
90 bucks a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Vicodins when I got some wisdom
teeth pulled and going to get those was
[SPEAKER_01]: like 14 bucks for like seven pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the generic shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, I don't even really
need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I want to throw down a bunch of
money for pills that I don't need?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I stopped taking pills, I was on two
different pain medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, neither of them were opiates,
uh, but neither of them worked for shit
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was on a third med to help cope
with some of the side effects from the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started smoking regularly,
um, and first got access to CBD flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I, I didn't have a need for the pills
at all the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just didn't take them one day and
then I didn't take them the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're drug free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, except for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're drug free, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think cannabis is like a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a plant, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a plant, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still totally a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a very good one.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't do any hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long, how long does those go ahead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, something to say on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I was just interested in what he
was saying, but I was thinking while he
[SPEAKER_04]: was saying that, that, um, since I'm
primarily using concentrates now,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, I've gotten completely off of two
narcotic medications that I was getting
[SPEAKER_04]: through my doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, from smoking concentrates on a daily
basis, smoking concentrates on a daily
[SPEAKER_04]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long, how often do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, probably starting within an hour after
I wake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just, yeah, cause you got to keep
the pain away before it sets in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get a head start on the pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, throughout the day,
it's not like a sit down smoke fast for
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's just you've got the pacifier
hanging on your neck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got it right around my neck and
take a couple of rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I go along my merry way,
it happens to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I really like
about my pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I find myself using it when I get home
between like walking in the door from work
[SPEAKER_00]: and then like, getting the dogs taken care
of, getting the kid taken care of,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting dinner around, getting,
you know, checking in with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: family members and seeing how their day
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to sit down and take a
dab and put my feet up or sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The single life's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the email on and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like four rigs on the table to
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have this kitchen set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had four 14 year olds walk into my house
at three 30 today, like looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: place to spend an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have killed an hour and a half
right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you let them, you know,
it becomes a permanent roosting place for
[SPEAKER_04]: a half hour every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so how much, how much hash,
uh, how long does a grandma hash last you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think I want to ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grandma hash last me three, maybe four
days tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting down on about a quarter
gram of good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is the same hash that I
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Doug gets the hash that I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I get a slab, uh, I break some off
and it goes to Doug's direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I know when Doug needs hash,
I've got him kind of on a good schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so I try to get mine around the
same time and we all, I get, he gets the
[SPEAKER_01]: same shit that I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: He smokes what I smoke you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's smoking top quality shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sometimes it's wax if others good wax
around, but it's usually top quality snap
[SPEAKER_01]: type shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Weed and shatter 90% of the time
or the turpex boys or the turpex boys,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is also very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's smoking the same stuff as me about
a quarter gram a day through a vape pen to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep himself medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys, you can get that,
uh, at a medical dispensary, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be 30, 35 bucks at a rec shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, how much is a gram of turpex ash
going to cost us?
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 plus tax comes to 58 change at the
door.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 55, 58 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 58 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't think that scares all of us
that are on medical marijuana that see
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries changing from just medical to
medical and recreational, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: possibly to just recreational,
uh, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my best to keep taking
care of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you guys are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you guys are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to take Doug to renew
his medical marijuana card on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep up on that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find rec hash in a range of prices
between like 25 and 30 gram up to 90 a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram here locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's not always quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of real mediocre
amateur product on the market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're our, even our legal market
doesn't have all of the things in place
[SPEAKER_00]: that it should quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, standards are still a little lax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a little off topic, but did you buy
any of the live wax from the spot that TR
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not purchased any, but I have
consumed some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like a review of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: See one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of the stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got half a dozen flavors on the
shelf now, but I got some of the stardog
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be investing, investing in some of
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, the night I dropped my rig,
um, I got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the consolation 10 minutes
later while I was mourning the loss of my
[SPEAKER_00]: original rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got to hit some, what was 98 grams
is now 75 a gram hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may step in there after, after a work
tomorrow and grab some of that and then a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me if you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked Doug how quickly it works,
how he consumes it and how much of it he
[SPEAKER_01]: uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to jump to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about how he's using
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask about when you've been
dabbing lately, how many dabs does it take
[SPEAKER_01]: for you to feel relief?
[SPEAKER_00]: One to feel relief to, to kind of push the
pain down to where it's sort of like your
[SPEAKER_00]: toe itches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer something of, um,
it's something you're aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not something of importance.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I feel after work is right
there in that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I start out with pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually about three of what I think of as
Mike size dabs, which are fairly small
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it does about a third day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say maybe 0.1 a dab,
maybe even a little less than that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, but after about three,
like there's some intoxication and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more fun going on than, than just
medical effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that first dab, all just turning the
pain down from a five down into the one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two range.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two and a half dabs would be cool,
but you take that number three cause you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't take a half dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some, then there's some
intoxication going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but you can handle six or eight
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can sit here and take eight or 10
and still be coherent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just be really stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just stoned and a little giddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get to the, uh, the synergy drops
that you've been taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you said you take three milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, three milliliters in the morning and
the three at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dosing is 1.7 milligrams of THC
and CBD per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I remember this, I'm taking about
5.8 milligrams of each in the morning and
[SPEAKER_00]: then in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I could drink the whole hundred
milligram bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 50 milligrams of both, it just drink it
down like a shot or a chug it like a beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not get much intoxication from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I take it in small doses in the
morning and the evening, it feels like my
[SPEAKER_00]: knees never get to the point where they're
really swollen and stiff and achy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my neck never gets to the point where
it's just a solid bar of muscle cramped
[SPEAKER_00]: up, trying to protect those vertebrae that
are squeezing nerve, nerve stems going
[SPEAKER_00]: down that arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys, I feel like my mic is really
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, part of what, why they're doing the
THC CBD combo is I believe that you need
[SPEAKER_01]: both cannabinoids to get into your
bloodstream, to work together,
[SPEAKER_01]: to hit the mind a little bit, to take your
mind off of things, to work on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC hits the nerve pain, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the CBD goes for the, like the swollen
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think together you don't get super
high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't feel much high from the CBD THC
50-50 combo because the CBD really feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like it calms down the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, there's research into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD keeps the THC high from being quite a
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CBD helps kind of tone it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, I've heard people carry CBD pills
from time to time when there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme consumption going on, just in case
anybody goes a little overboard,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got sort of a come down lever that
they can pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your girlfriend takes a big dab and
can't handle her shit, you just give her a
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD dab and she'll relax a little in
theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or somebody doesn't read the label and
eats the whole candy bar and never did it
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, then you just want to leave them alone
and not give them any more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give them some cartoons and some good
food, make them a sandwich, a sandwich
[SPEAKER_01]: shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, how much does the synergy cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 a bottle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lasts you a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, five days, five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Doug's plant pan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to a dispensary, it's going to
be 40, 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30, maybe 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can hunt and find like member
pricing and you get that first time
[SPEAKER_01]: shopper at a medical shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple that I've seen advertise
it on certain days at certain times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a special or something on
Wednesday or some shit, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've never been able to find a
constant quality like you deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's the difference between,
uh, a good caregiver and a bad caregiver
[SPEAKER_00]: is being sort of hammered out on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that I did not have to charge Doug
anything for the, uh, the hash that he
[SPEAKER_01]: consumes, but it doesn't always come from
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to go get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to just relay it and I don't
make a penny off of my, my caregiver-ness
[SPEAKER_01]: for people like people that I am their
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't make any money off of those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug stays pretty well medicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some flow right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some nice flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have some white widow in a couple of
few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike just looked at me like, huh,
what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that ever so often craving for the
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, uh, you know, I, I'm a dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, uh, I fucking going to jump into
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take fat dad, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my knees hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: My knees fucking hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys were ever near me and hear me
bend over or just crouch down,
[SPEAKER_01]: my knees sound like shotguns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be as tall as we are and not
have any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause my knees get wobbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when I'm tired, like they just
get like shaky and my hips hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I've got some stomach
issues, you guys, and not a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my stomach sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some stomach problems,
but so I take fat, fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I take, um, some more between
0.3 and 0.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to smoke about a gram and a half a
hash a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do that in about three sessions
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take about one dab in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right when like, not right when I get up
and get myself, I like get up to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning shower and get dressed right
before I leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take one dab just so that I'm kind of
crispy when I'm getting where I'm going at
[SPEAKER_01]: lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I may get a little dab, like about a
0.3 and then do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some of that CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after work, I'll come home and
take like a 0.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, before the show I did about
a 0.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on in the evening before
bed, I'll just drop like another 0.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of taking 30 dabs throughout the
day, I take like six or seven of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, maybe three to six fat dabs
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that keeps me well-medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's expensive, but since I'm the,
I, I produce it myself mostly like that
[SPEAKER_01]: part, or I get it from, Spence,
Garden of Weedon kind of guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I should be saying that
much on the show, but, uh, since the
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Weedon can supply us with
quality hash and dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: I work at a shop that can supply me with
quality hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go to a medical shop and buy a
bunch of shit all the time, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I smoke a lot and I stay
well-medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to eat edibles, but they hit me
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do edibles hit you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they hit me hard too, but it's
because you're consuming a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's staying within your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not blowing out 35% of what you
just took in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it takes a little longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the rush is a little different the way
that it feels when it starts to get into
[SPEAKER_04]: your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it comes on slower,
but hits a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, more of a body feeling problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you take some CBD oil and some of the
jelly bean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I use the CBD oil to keep the jelly
bean wax stuck to the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fucking mad man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepare to hear me cough like a sissy
girl, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to work oddly, but I trust
you with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't burn yourself or microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's playing with the email cord and the
dab rig and the microphone in his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it looks like the pothead Olympics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kind of stoner obstacle course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cord management bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cord management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I want to ask him, when he gets done
coughing, I'm going to ask him about how
[SPEAKER_01]: he likes edibles and how they work for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, Doug, you were talking earlier
about how medicine just, uh, totally,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, helps your like psychological whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need a sativa or does a CBD
medicine get to your head a little bit as
[SPEAKER_01]: well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when you smoke the Tora Bora,
the Tora Bora is really high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can use that as a specific plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really liked the Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, shout out to DNA genetics for breeding
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, shout out to the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got me a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, uh, you can tell between different
strains, even with some that say they are
[SPEAKER_04]: the same strain, uh, different ways that
it affects you as you, as you're ingesting
[SPEAKER_04]: it, you know, uh, some more mentally than
physically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of forget about the pain
before the relief of the pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Tora Bora is more of relief of the
pain and then the mental aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes and knocks out the pain and
then later on it gets you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't smoke a lot of the CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it doesn't do much for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys get all the CBD products
that I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted that hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Doug wants a dab of that one,
give him a dab of that one too,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure Doug gets some CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give him too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get big dabs of the CBD oil
because it's super viscous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, uh, this dabbers got a flat tip on
it and it may work a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like it was burning for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that weird how your body can do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys winter is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about winter, but fall is
certainly here in Colorado.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a long sleeve shirt when you
drive to work in the mornings and done
[SPEAKER_01]: changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and speaking medically,
I know we're talking about pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'd love to hear what you have to say,
Doug, but, uh, I'm disabled with post
[SPEAKER_04]: traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I know there's been a lot of
studies looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's probably the best
medicine for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I've tried and had been prescribed
many other things, but I believe that
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is probably the best thing that
I've ever had that helps me control,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, what goes on with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, I don't want to,
yeah, I, I probably got a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to compare myself,
but I probably got something to not agree
[SPEAKER_01]: with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I started thinking about shit that
I don't even want to think about,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make those things not happen in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just by coming and just taking a
couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be part of the ritual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying earlier, I've just
done grab a dab, get into the internet,
[SPEAKER_01]: play around for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also, you know, for me, it's real
hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: For, uh, he used to love to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was lots of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that way anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really have to get prepared to go to the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because I don't know what I'm going to
get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I get the same thing every time,
but just to deal with, with people in
[SPEAKER_04]: close quarters is making nervous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes me uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather not deal with, I come up in
the parking lots, completely full,
[SPEAKER_04]: or you look over in the baskets are almost
all gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just go back home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if I really need the food,
I'll just go back home, chill for a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit and wait for the crowds to die down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, not that bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, sometimes you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got other people depending
on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you suck it up and you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes faced with those types of
situations, cannabis definitely helps me
[SPEAKER_04]: deal with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of anxiety, a little
PTSD, a little bit of social anxiety.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody's listening that doesn't
think that this shit is good for PTSD,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause in Colorado, we cannot get it
validated as a, a qualifying condition for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical treatment or for medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys think that that's not a reason
to use it, listen to this dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an honest guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude has never lied to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe every single word that Doug has
ever said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's got no reason to lie to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a 60 year old dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody to impress anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some dads with these kids and be on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I enjoy being with you and I'm going
to enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Salute.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my good friend Doug is really quite
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a shout out to the person that gave
it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they want to be mentioned
on the show or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do nice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pain is melting as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cherry flavor.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke a lot of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saved all that for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's kind of over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of tucked away until you guys
showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a mouthful of cherries out of
the hit man rig with the elevate dropdown
[SPEAKER_01]: on the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're champs over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was marvelous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on for helping them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, Mike, the, uh, it looks like some
climbed up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This carb cap needs to be cleaned a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get quite filthy around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody needs dad, there's a little wax in
here, but I think you guys would be cool
[SPEAKER_01]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Doug was talking about, uh,
you were talking about how bad helps with
[SPEAKER_01]: the PTSD.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and we, you know, the military
was looking into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they found out that they didn't want
to do it right now, but I, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if you were to talk some
people that were suffering from it,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I think we see a lot of them around
town now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is where the help is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people are coming here and you
guys, unfortunately what I've discovered
[SPEAKER_01]: through some conversations lately,
there are a lot of children moving here
[SPEAKER_01]: for CBD treatment and those people are
falling into traps with people that
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise that they can give them CBD
medicine and they're not providing the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, if you're looking for
qualified, legitimate CBD medicine in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, somebody that can take on a new
person and provide that it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: three month wait, maybe six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caregivers are strapped and with the
new regulations taking effect in January,
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt, um, many more people will be
becoming caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect a number of caregivers in
business now to end up not being
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers sometime by the middle of next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the state's really looking to clamp
down and kind of stamp out that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: section of our industry, which sucks for
people like me and Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's depressing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of new rules coming down the
pipe that are going to make it incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for people to produce the amount
of meds they need for their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's by design.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want everybody buying from the
stores.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to see Walmart type stores
in the future.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like we talked about earlier,
I'm already having to source other shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: to get you guys supplied in your shatter
because everybody stepped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was a good idea for me
to step everybody up to shatter,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I got you guys all smoking good hash
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I can't even supply enough of it
because you guys smoke so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not complaining, but between the three
of us, we clean out the garden that I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and other people that I know are,
everybody's looking towards concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's so much more convenient and
it works better all the way around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's the time saver is what I've
been enjoying lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my day is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hours are very, very well allocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have extra time to grind up some
bud, pack a bowl, sit there and puff on it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have that kind of time
anymore.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a quick dab gets me where I need to be
and I can get back to doing whatever I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be doing.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a fad dunk, take a fad dunk and keep
on moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab, cough for a minute,
chug a soda and get back to whatever I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the other half of the yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make fun of Mike for a
minute, but this is all in good fun
[SPEAKER_01]: because he's one of my favorite people to
hang out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's my bro and he knows it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're ever with Mike and you are
thirsty, just tap him on the shoulder and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, just ask for a soda, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Mike has a Mountain Dew with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike probably has six to 12 Mountain Dews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got sick of having cod mouth and not
having anything to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did some about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people carry like their cigarettes in
like a safe spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's got Mountain Dews up his sleeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can fling them out of his arm like he's
Spiderman or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got at least one at reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you guys kind of letting
me talk a little bit about your conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any, I want to change the
subject in just a second, but before I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give you guys the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything to add to this part
before I kind of move on to a totally
[SPEAKER_01]: random question that I want to ask you
guys about, just because I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys both looked at me in silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to a bigger selection
of CBD edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be nice to just get up and eat
like a muffin or a bagel or a cookie or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that just had your dose in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the way that this industry
is working, you guys aren't going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to eat muffins and cookies for much
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to regulate the shit out of
it so much that a muffin will not be
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed a cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can airbrush that dumbass
yellow triangle on it, they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can airbrush my poppy seed muffin
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regulations on edibles are becoming
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting really ridiculous and it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite products are going to
be leaving store shelves and coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: in 10 milligram maximum containers,
which sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kick in time is a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bet you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially on empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget how spoiled I am being a medical
patient, being able to walk into a shop
[SPEAKER_01]: and get a drink with a hundred milligrams
of THC and that sucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the rec side, you guys have to put
10 milligrams in them and drink 10 of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a hundred milligram drink
right now, but they're taking that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't carry the stamp, it's got to
be in a 10 milligram package period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't stamp your shit no more,
I mean, you can't stamp liquids period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So liquids, popcorns, granolas,
that kind of thing's got to come in a 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actually going to put a stamp
on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the teacher can see it from across
the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a triangle on my cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shouldn't it be parenting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shouldn't we focus on parenting instead of
labeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucked up analogy that I came up with
is we put a special symbol on the fake
[SPEAKER_00]: guns, not the real ones, but we got to put
a special symbol on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now all your toy guns got to come
with the little orange nub on the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no real gun doesn't need nothing on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, just so you know, this is a gun
gun and not like a lookalike gun or a
[SPEAKER_00]: squirt gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish somebody could have seen me
pressing my forehead against this
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone in retardation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now all the pot cookies have to carry
a special fucking warning symbol because
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have never been in a marijuana
shop are convinced that they look just
[SPEAKER_00]: like Chips Ahoy and that they're going to
be at a party one day and one of us is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change out the real Chips Ahoy
for the medicated Chips Ahoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to kill everybody at
their church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to share the cookies with you
guys because you're my friends and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hey, there's weed in these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat them with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chinned up so much fear last
Halloween that we're definitely going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass this rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to head that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was part of what I was going to ask
here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two questions for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Halloween scare was one of them
because we were putting up Halloween
[SPEAKER_01]: decorations at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, do you guys really think
that somebody is going to give out some
[SPEAKER_01]: weed candy this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike kind of beat me to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, they're going to eat it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two big anti-pot groups in the state,
like took out billboards with edibles out
[SPEAKER_00]: of their packaging next to candy and
edible trees that they look similar to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, if you can't tell the
difference, how were your kids and not a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of people in the state were
convinced that the day after Halloween,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the ERs would just be full of kids
that were just high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't happen for a lot of reasons,
mostly because it's the dumbest crime
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are so many better ways to get
a felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hand out dirty candy on
Halloween and have like that leads right
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no payoff for the criminal
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got about three hours worth of the
sick fuck that likes to hurt kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: like doesn't like to hurt kids in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was expensive.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 25 bucks a fucking piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who's got that kind of money to get
local kids snowed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to eat them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys think that you have candy that
your kids got on Halloween and you suspect
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is medicated with cannabis,
you can send it right to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a PO box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pick it up in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come pick it up in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fuck all this mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get myself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it or half of it, whatever you
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a little bit, I'll tell you if that
shit has a medicated cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if that's if it's medicated
with, with THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always, it's always the scare tactic
about the children.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I was a child and went
trick or treating, people gave out popcorn
[SPEAKER_04]: balls and fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one year there was a massive
scare that someone was putting razor
[SPEAKER_04]: blades in those fruits and other things in
your cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden, you couldn't take
grandma's treats anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to go buy them from the store and
they had to be packaged and Mars company
[SPEAKER_04]: loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you think did it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, and there was never,
it was the best marketing campaign Mars
[SPEAKER_00]: could have ever come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost too smart for a corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They paid one of their kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me feed you this snickers or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me feed you this random X brand candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost never happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put you on the news and then we'll
make you rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the type of asshole who spent four
hours on the internet looking for cases
[SPEAKER_00]: of, it's happened like three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them were family members that were
like, fuck my dumb ass nephew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's not funny, but it's
really funny because when you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: the links we've gone to as a nation to
like every nice old lady that's ever tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sugar cookies for all the kids
that come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like three hours into Halloween,
they realized that their sidewalks covered
[SPEAKER_00]: with sugar cookies and all the parents
think they're insane because they just
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to miss that part of their,
our mass education against taking
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious treats from people on Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a cookie from a old lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She ain't got no reason to hate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty scared of who I take candy from
as an adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to grateful dead shows,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't take candy from strangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got fucked up your whole weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, and as a responsible parent,
you look through that candy before you
[SPEAKER_04]: give your child just to make sure they're
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents love that rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got back the number of Snickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I fucking collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the special pile over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These might've been open or something
wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we used to go to the fancy
neighborhoods and find out where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: giving out the best candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would take two or three masks
in my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still trick or treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, at least I wasn't stealing the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my friends were just taking bags
from other kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually trick or treating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pled my case to some lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, you're too old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, I could have just been out
stealing candy from kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, here, take two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, let's shift gears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you guys, this will be coming out a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Halloweenish show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since number 100 is going to be
celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one after 101 will probably be the
Halloween show, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's October.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fall celebration show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harvest party.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boo preview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should get Jesse on here to talk about
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people harvest then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop, chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they got to keep it, it was worth
the time also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, number 100 is next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You figured out what you're doing yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, we're going to have a bunch of
people on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk about stuff.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know those shows when I set up like
six microphones and it gets chaotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take dabs and it's going to
be loud and Spence will hit Matty in the
[SPEAKER_01]: face with the microphone a lot and we'll
laugh a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I can get Matty and Spence over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another episode 50, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 times too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be twice as great.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to, uh, if you're
listening to the podcast this far,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love you for listening to our random
banter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just buddies hanging out at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to be dedicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's something you remember from
the first hundred episodes that you'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: me to reminisce about, uh, send me your
favorite moments of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're thinking about,
what makes you laugh, your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: memories, something that sticks out to you
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think of like,
remember that one time you said this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you can send a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, you're not limited to just one,
but tweet it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's at GFYH podcast, email it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
or find it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the grow from your heart podcast on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Message me, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll kind of reminisce about it and
go talk back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've added on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let me know what episode be like an
episode, this, you said this or just
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, let me know what you
remember and we'll laugh about it again
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, I did say that because
sometimes I say some goofy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I say some great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remind me what stood out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same goes for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like something I said on the show,
you guys have been getting a lot of me
[SPEAKER_00]: lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys follow Mike on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your Twitter handle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemopunk15, uh, yeah, at Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he wants more followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you follow him, let him know that
you found him on the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know you're tweeting or you're
following me from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw me fucking with prohibitionists
and thought it was funny and wanted more
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find me, uh, you're too stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug doesn't really do much social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep him on the down low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so lately you guys, the hot topic has
been, uh, and we're just going to go on
[SPEAKER_01]: this one for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I wrote it down and I just want to
be able to cross it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm a completionist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, how do you guys feel about
professional athletes being able to use
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana first in their on season and
also in their off season?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's two different subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the clock and not off the clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you're with the team,
they kind of own you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to make two separate separate
subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I say that wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that not good to say you don't look
like, no, I don't mean it like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do kind of, maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on your take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you always be careful with that
particular rivage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, you're not, totally in
the wrong, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they live under some pretty insane
fucking regiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on their clock all the time during
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's, it doesn't, they're worth
millions and millions of dollars.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, their house just keeps getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're on the clock basically during
the on season, the whole season from the
[SPEAKER_01]: time season starts from whatever preseason
training time spring, whatever spring
[SPEAKER_01]: training, when it starts, you're on the
clock until that Superbowl or whenever
[SPEAKER_01]: your team is fucking finished,
whatever you fail or win, you're on the
[SPEAKER_01]: clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So should you be able to use cannabis to
alleviate your pains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, or for whatever reason, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a recreational state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neuroprotectant research coming out
that's really promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it might really help, uh,
deal with concussions, brain injuries,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be really, yeah, it might be
insanely fucking helpful for people to get
[SPEAKER_00]: bashed in the face for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rugby players, people like boxers,
soccer players.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research is taking place right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you feel that, uh, on their off season
is what I'm asking about now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel that those guys should be allowed
to consume cannabis, medical or
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On their, during the off season,
as much as they, as much as they'd like,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can, they can drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it takes in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was king of the world, it would have
been legal for everybody a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Babylon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let everybody smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I'm sure you're going to say that
yes to this one also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that these guys, um,
and I'll ask about specific sports after
[SPEAKER_01]: it generalized, we'll just, we'll kind of
narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that professional athletes
should be able to consume cannabis on
[SPEAKER_01]: during the on season?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the night after a game, maybe the day
before a game, maybe what if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: better, what if you, what if you're a
better player when you smoke a fat joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should they be able to play, should they
be able to smoke right before the game?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a performance enhancing
drug, but how many other performance
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancing drugs are those other football
players using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis is so not a performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said that jokingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll know they're, they're legitimately
testing people as though it's steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that when they're looking for
steroids, they, they also look for pot as
[SPEAKER_00]: though they're the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at best it's helping you focus,
keeping you from being in pain while you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not making you stronger or faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building your muscles up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not increasing your adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, but I have absolutely no issues
stopping you from being inflamed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have absolutely no issues with people
consuming cannabis when they're not at
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are a lot of people who do shit
that's kind of, well, that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like football players crash into other
people with high speed and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of power there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that needs to be precisely controlled
or somebody's going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I'm down for us to go watch
people kill each other, but we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them like swords.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just call it gladiatorial fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're going to go that route,
like getting football players intoxicated
[SPEAKER_00]: and letting them rush at each other is not
how we get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be one of the things
people tweet about on episode 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring back gladiators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like Mike's point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me saying that people own people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be another thing that I hear
about, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a faux pas and I apologize now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what I meant at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we step in the trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Words are hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm politically erect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything means 11 things.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we all think that sports athletes,
the professional athletes should be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're allowed to drink alcohol if they
so choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Colorado, we have pretty much put
the same rules on booze or on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: rules on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what they mirrored off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can, most of us can go out after a
hard day of whatever we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't, how many, how many other
people slam into other people all day for
[SPEAKER_01]: a damn living?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why can't these people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go smoke a little bit of reefer if their
buddies can smoke, can drink some beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I can't drink beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer is no good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer does nothing good for me,
but smoking cannabis, I have plenty of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal value and plenty of benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't go drink beer after work like
several people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not judging them saying that
doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come home and smoke some weed,
smoke some dabs and it works wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have an alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it shouldn't have to be confined to
places where you can't be seen.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you have to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults like to gather and enjoy
intoxicants with other adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's literally this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taxing us for us for it and give us
some more to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first humans around the first fire got
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they gathered to get fucked up around
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's just how humans work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout history, there's always been a
tavern or I mean, in different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the country, it's every corner or in many
cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where people get together and
enjoy intoxicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, having a place where people can
go and consume pot together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we sure do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole country needs places.
[SPEAKER_01]: One or two or three or four in every state
where we can all just meet and have little
[SPEAKER_01]: puff sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: E-nails, dab rigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not be harassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not be harassed by the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always what we want, you guys,
is to be able to smoke cannabis peacefully
[SPEAKER_01]: and hang out and socialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be as many problems as you
have with alcohol consumption facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stone people don't want to fight.
No.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all get pretty heated in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some arguing beliefs between us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we can find something we disagree
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one big flaw in Dazed and Confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody in this room is going to swing at
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was beer in Dazed and Confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were drinking at the time,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to fight because he was out of
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched that movie with a number of
people for the first time, and typically
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the one comment that gets made
through the whole film is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why is he aggressive?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was his weed bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude was drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came there to drink beer and kick ass
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all out of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I really appreciate you guys for
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug, you got anything else you want to
add to us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should just hit stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we didn't give enough credit
to Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really wonderful edible
products on the market right now that you
[SPEAKER_00]: should definitely check out if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you recommend to somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chibichus just fucking went recreational,
and I'm way excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sick of telling people,
no, they're not recreational yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're recreational now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look for them on store shelves at
your rec shops in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are out of state,
if you're anywhere in the world and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 and up, you can come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fly to either Colorado Springs or Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fly to Denver and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck the Colorado Springs airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver airport is going to take you two
and a half to three hours to get to our
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell everybody that you heard about the
spot dispensary on the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab yourself some Chibichus and grab
yourself some quality flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what else should they grab while
they're at the shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're coming- Whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beauty of legalization is you
have a huge selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something will catch your eye in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, there's so much stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But come check out a Chibichu,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come get, if you want to get like kind of
high and be like trippy-dippy,
[SPEAKER_01]: get like a Sativa Chibichu.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of the first edible companies
to really nail the Sativa Indica hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got a CBD too now that I'm
just waiting to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been- I'm going to try that
because I love Chibis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw them get delivered just a few days
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chibichu guy was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to get kind of trippy,
get the Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to mellow out and giggle,
get the Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Indica are intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a kind of a balanced high,
get those hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a hybrid and go to the movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just looking for straight pain
relief and you don't want to feel high,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't want anybody to know that
you're consuming cannabis for pain relief,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the CBD chews for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make you head high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make you giggly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come get some Chibichus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what they do for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe don't take them home.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, keep them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a little Coco there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Joey Diaz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, some Chibichus, dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said Chibichus the second time,
you couldn't help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, subconsciously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey Coco Diaz is one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess subconsciously Joey Diaz just
slipped out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go get some Chibichus, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got these stars of death, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey's my hero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back to Colorado, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this, Joey Diaz,
come back to Colorado, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to come see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilarious as a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we have a lot else to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't give Edibles enough credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edibles are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take a little bit longer to work,
but when they do, boy, they really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to plan a little better with
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smoking so much simpler because you
can titrate your dose really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how hard what you just took is
going to hit you immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a little more, you can take a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're good, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Edibles, it takes an hour and a half
to kick in and you can't uneat drugs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a bonus if you can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat yourself some Edibles and then get
stoned and then try to go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully you're sleeping and
those Edibles will kick in while you're
[SPEAKER_01]: sleeping and keep you asleep through the
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been doing with Edibles
all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a hundred milligram package and
eat like 10 milligrams at eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams at nine, 20 at 10,
and 20 at 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I go to bed, they're kicking
in for the first few hours of a sleep.
Sweet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that metabolism moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have a full night's rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake up eight hours later, feeling great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's quickly, we've talked about dabs
and smoking, dabs and flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about Edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about your vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've kind of left out like rubs and
creams is all I think that's left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got one other product that we can
talk about if we have a couple seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you look like you've got something to
say about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you said rubs and creams,
I've talked to some people in my age
[SPEAKER_04]: bracket that are using some of the creams
for arthritis and swear by them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the best thing since sliced
bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not take them seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a friend of mine gave me a bottle
as a sample and I gave somebody a massage
[SPEAKER_01]: just from the shoulders to the mid back is
all she let me do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by then my fingers felt fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like I was wearing balloon gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was like, wow, that was like a
huge massage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it's that apothecary can,
it was apothecary can of pain cream is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely give the pains and SAVs
credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I did not before, but after that,
I believe I'm a believer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one of the, it was one of the first
generation topical lotions in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: just random lotion in a bottle with like a
company sticker on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what the brand was,
but I use it for after trimming to help
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb the rest of the trichomes off my
skin that I couldn't get washed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked wonderful for that,
but it would also help ease the pain from
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you spend seven, eight hours
scissoring like a madman, your fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: cramp up one hand's holding a little stem
all night, all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one's working a pair of
scissors for that whole shift that hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pain cream, I mean, an hour after
I used it, I felt like I hadn't been at
[SPEAKER_00]: work all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the ladies that trimmed my
weed for me the other night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well done ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've covered, it seems like we've
covered 90% of the consumption methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have either of you guys tried,
Mike's had some tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did those work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they have any medicinal value?
[SPEAKER_00]: The teas that I was really into most of
that, I mean, the dose was so low and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality was so sketchy back then that it
was probably just a good flavor tea that I
[SPEAKER_00]: liked paying $5 a bag for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a couple of teas on the market
that people swear by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still working my way down the edible
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a transdermal patch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried one of those yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who did in an effort to
treat fibromyalgia with a CBD patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said it worked, but not as well as
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's got a CBD oil cartridge for her
vape pen that she really, really likes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for fibromyalgia myself, used to be on
Lyrica.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 9,000 side effects on the
commercial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're all smiling and talking about
anal drainage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, this is one of the drugs
that I got rid of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once started using the concentrates on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: From medicine that myself and the Garden
of Weedon produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, that feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: To know that Lyrica is gone out of your
diet because of things that Spence and I
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer, I hope you hear that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lyrica, methadone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All out of the, no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be too much, but a while back
when I'd go visit you, sometimes you'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking out of it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lately you've been sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been Douglas again, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is cool to be yourself again and
not under a haze of medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find the remote now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find your phone now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't want the remote as much now
because you want to go out and do
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you've got energy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got mobility again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you guys could see the look on
Doug's face.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sincere as fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not bullshitting you at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain is a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just dials back every other part of
your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a tiny, tiny boo-boo on my finger
and it's been fucking up my whole week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a tiny boo-boo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could imagine, I mean, I've got some
pain, but I can imagine having like hip
[SPEAKER_01]: pain at your age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, God damn, I'm going to feel like I'm
falling apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just like when my knees really
start throbbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the muscles on either side of it
tense up trying to protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you walk a little funny trying to
protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of the day, everything
below your nipples is sore because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep your knee from being really
sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then living like that for weeks and
months on end, you just become exhausted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after years you start walking
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start living different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depicts you greatly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you can't think of anything else
except pain, when it's like a high note
[SPEAKER_04]: right between your ears and that's all
that you can do is hear that scream that
[SPEAKER_04]: your mind is giving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're hurting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not enough you can do at that point,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's just, you know,
sometimes it's just curl up and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and invite the bullet until something
you can do to give some relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes heat, sometimes cold,
sometimes pharmaceutical medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people go to alcohol for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we've seen since the beginning
of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have always, I remember my
grandparents would talk about,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd take their shot and go,
that's our medicine for the night.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of their lives, however,
they wish that at least that's what they
[SPEAKER_04]: told me was that they wish they had quit
that earlier in their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one of the reasons I stopped
earlier in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like the way you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure we'd get along if you drank.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you wouldn't like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would like me if I drank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so much alike, Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so much alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're such good bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that I was a lot like you were
when I drank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're a lot like each other that we
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fist bump, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, there's one more way of
consumption that I can think of that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have not talked about that I have tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's looking at me like, uh,
the lube, bro, the lube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work at a, I work at a dispensary
and, uh, I got some lube dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's called EVOS, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different companies
that, uh, make it Aria is the main one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we carry EVOS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got it from the spot dispensary
sample day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get high at all from it,
but yeah, Doug's looking at me like that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of lube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, that kind of lube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nice thing about topicals is
there's not an intoxication with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a medical effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the instructions said like spray three
to four sprays on her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went with like eight because,
you know, double up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't spraying that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like spraying it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it totally had sex with this
chick and it felt warm and tingly and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like hotter than normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the temperature was higher and,
um, it took a little more effort to finish
[SPEAKER_01]: up to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had to like wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, let me, let me try a
little harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you did a big review of this on a
previous show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we kind of did, but we also did a
review of what happens when I smoke too
[SPEAKER_01]: much CBD and I can't finish up at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the base substance of the spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they infuse it with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, I pretty much think they put
coconut oil in a crock pot and throw a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of bud in there and then strain out
the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I really think they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would not be surprised to find that that's
the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprayed some in my hand and tasted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is just coconut oil with
weed in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ingredients are coconut oil and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two products Jeff is highly familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at all about the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks live on coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for everything, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your hands are all sticky and you can't
get the resin off your hands from trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of coconut oil and take that
shit right off real quick.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Million one uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first one I'll tell you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other ones you don't even want
to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start wrapping up this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to do it earlier, but we've got so
much shit to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've covered all ways that I am
familiar with consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did touch on, on children about people
coming here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of talked about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to make a quick point
because I, I know someone who has a
[SPEAKER_04]: special needs child seizures multiple
times throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally was able to get medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And has changed their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 180 degrees around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you don't believe in this
stuff, you need to come and see what it
[SPEAKER_04]: does.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're worried about the children,
worry about the ones that need this
[SPEAKER_04]: medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And get it because it's made this not just
this child's life much happier,
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoyable, productive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you've ever been a caregiver of
someone who suffers from something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you realize that that ripple expands out
there far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you give relief to the one that
everyone cares so much about that ripple
[SPEAKER_04]: expands and gives relief to everyone that
cares about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a family moving here with a kid
looking for CBD oil, or if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: moving here, looking for CBD oil,
take your time to hunt down legit
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of places we, or Jeff
talked about a news article recently that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's hemp extract oil being sent from
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can buy it online and have it
shipped to you, it's not the real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it outside of a dispensary,
you have to be standing in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 50-50 chance it's not the real
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're lucky and you live in another
state that has a really solid medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana program and lab testing for
cannabinoids is required, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get the lab test right there with
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check and see what you're buying
right there in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't be a little sketched out that
you're buying stuff from a store that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't come with that, that should be
standard now with legal ization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, if they don't have the lab
test, they're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that simple.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a legal product in Colorado,
you have to have it lab tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the store clerk tells you they don't
have the lab test, they're lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't want you to see something
or- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you to see that they're
13% THC or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're being lazy and don't want to
grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's standard information now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to find CBD meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a good selection available
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to take the time to find it
from a legitimate dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate seeing people come in here looking
for what we've got and finding stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legitimate dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word dealer in there made that a funny
ass sentence in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at Doug like, did you catch that
at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said legitimate dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have dealers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any retailer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legitimate retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your legitimate MMC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: MIPS number.
[SPEAKER_01]: MIPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look for all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's got a MIPS number and an
OPC number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should have a lot of shit written on
the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way more than you're going to want to
read, but read it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read those labels once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out, see what's going into the
cannabis that you're buying from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much interesting shit on the
labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grab some of the pamphlets from the
front too sometimes where they got those
[SPEAKER_01]: like informative brochures that tell you
about what certain cannabinoids do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inform yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how people are like, you know so
much about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just read some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go to a magic weed school.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time I think we're serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody got any other methods of
consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody went blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any shout outs or anything you want to
give?
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all right then.

happen.

out on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get down and have a good
ass time.

that we need to get out.

back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely worth going back through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good info.

to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's episode 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am right now currently cracking open
a 100-milligram Incredibles pumpkin pie
[SPEAKER_01]: delight, pumpkin spice and graham cracker
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing's got 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friend Craig for throwing
this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, eat this on episode 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Craig if you listen to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Craig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Craig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on the table, I've got an affogato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Affogato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Affogato bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a pumpkin pie,
pumpkin pie delight bar on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody would like some pieces of these
edibles, feel free to jump in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I get like this much of this
affogato, I'll be cool with life.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get at it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's eat some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can already hear Sloppy and Joe over
there taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go too far, let's mention- Yeah,
Mike already kind of got me to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, then I'm going to grab this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it, Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm claiming that piece though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the hell was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the e-nails are hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Sloppy and Joe were chilling at
the burniture table over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got two e-nails built into the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my boy, Bobo Blasterco for
sending me the dope ass table.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are getting dabbed the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think they're on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so, they're taking dabs,
eating edibles and chilling like Beavis
[SPEAKER_01]: and Butthead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auxiliary microphone team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are sharing a microphone and they are
sexy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dig into this freaking,
let's see, I'm going to start with a bite
[SPEAKER_01]: of this affogato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm going to eat 120 milligrams
to get started probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loving that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like a Starbucks drink in a
medical bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is exactly that, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's grabbing the label for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we lose a hundred milligram bar from
Incredibles and the label reads affogato,
[SPEAKER_00]: vanilla latte, espresso beans and caramel
swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a white chocolate cookies and
cream bar with coffee beans in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why y'all sleeping on the pumpkin pie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big shout out to Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: These pieces are perfectly sectioned and
labeled into 10 milligram doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recommended dosage for a noob is 10
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to see what 10 milligrams should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be no dosage concerns for
people from out of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simplified it for everybody here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes amazing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this affogato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgotto.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgotto.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgotto.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, before we go too far,
I want to get serious for just a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to give a shout out to our
friends, Justin and Jessica and their
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an 11 year old son and he had a
major seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has some technical, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear those coffee beans crunching in
my teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin and Jessica have an 11 year old son
who currently is having brain surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to send a big, just a silent
vibration of those guys for half a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that was for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want their son to heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want him to be better and I want them to
feel comforted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a big shout out to Justin and
Jessica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I hope you guys get much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everything goes great for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love and support from the Grow From
Your Heart podcast and everybody here at
[SPEAKER_01]: the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang, everybody went silent, somber.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could feel the love and the concern in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just hoping for a speedy recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a kid out of the hospital,
so I'm feeling for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, much love to the whole family there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much support from the show and everybody
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also the same person sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked for memories from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Joseph, they're dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys need bottles of water or
anything, I got them here on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make yourselves at home, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jessica sent me a Twitter message and
it said, you've got to talk about when the
[SPEAKER_01]: dude tried to dab the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike was here one night and we were
recording a show and I handed him the rig
[SPEAKER_01]: and I handed him the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: He held the rig in one hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put the dab onto the nail and he put
his mouth onto the microphone and tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: inhale through the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, took a big old head off the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is adorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me laugh for like a good 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had to press pause because I
laughed my ass off.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm laughing just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How high was he?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the rig and I dabbed it and capped
it and then just tried to hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he couldn't figure out why the smoke
wasn't coming through the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stared at the microphone for a second
mad, like, why isn't this rig working?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of saw what was happening,
kind of wasn't sure what I saw happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was pretty sure that that's what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Maddie just busted off a piece of the
pumpkin bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm busting off a piece of the pumpkin
bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe just came in for some pumpkin bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of edibles and this was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers to everybody that's taken a bite of
their pumpkin bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what this thing tastes like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to keep track of what I've
eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had, this will be, I've had 20
milligrams so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be 30 and 40.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are these chips in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham cracker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pumpkin pie for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is an amazing edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're so spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more weed flavor in our pop food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the coffee, the coffee beans really
take away that after bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess with the pumpkin pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do get the weedy kind of aftertaste
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's earthy and it blends well with the
pumpkin flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Parmesan cheese on spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_01]: This and a milkshake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie is onto something.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Incredibles pumpkin pie delight,
pumpkin spice and graham crackers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff approves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not an experienced ganja edible
eater, you're going to be wrecked because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just going to keep eating this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to remember this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microphone voice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just scream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're even, if you have a sweet tooth,
you have no chance of saving this bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to be silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat this thing for the next five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've pumped up this Incredibles
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the pumpkin spice one is
only seasonal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only around around the holidays here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be out in just a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, when you hear this,
go to the spot dispensary in Pueblo S
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and grab yourself some
Incredibles edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you and
that you heard about the spot from the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go buy edibles there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to take a quick sip.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing's kind of a drying up my face.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 40 milligrams deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie and I are teaming up on the
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you want to crack open more,
do not be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what we should mention though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two cannabis cup winners at the
table and we have not even acknowledged
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys congrats on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't been on the show since you won
a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you've been here since you
won a cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still remember that when they said,
I remember when they announced it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they said NCB D concentrate goes to,
and they said OG to, and before they
[SPEAKER_01]: finished the name of the strain,
I threw my arms up in the air and I looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at my friend that was with me and I was
like, that's the garden of waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so stoked for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was proud of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they said it, I didn't even realize
that it was us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they said it and I like kept like
saying it over and over and get in my
[SPEAKER_06]: head.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Spencer was like, Maddie, let's go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like my friends all started rushing up
on the stage with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the best part is everyone was on
stage with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the back taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to see you guys up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another cannabis cup coming up in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have anything planned for
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was thinking about Denver,
but unfortunately, Cali just got canceled.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we get lucky enough to have a cup of
Denver, then I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: But just with the way everything's going,
I don't think that stuff's going to last
[SPEAKER_07]: much longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless it's like in like Jamaica,
that'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to touch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamaica because it's in a different
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already approved that with the
Jamaican council.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think Michigan, I was looking
at it on the website today and Michigan
[SPEAKER_07]: has, is it either Michigan?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's California.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one in LA that they do February of
every year is going to have like two
[SPEAKER_07]: weekends.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be one weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like, I don't know what they're
doing the entire week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next weekend it's like,
so, you know, things are changing with
[SPEAKER_07]: like different states trying to allow high
times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it just comes down to like
probably how much money you want to put
[SPEAKER_07]: into it, which they're probably still
paying a ridiculous amount to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, get locations and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But just when, you know, at cannabis cups,
it's usually like people giving away
[SPEAKER_07]: samples and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's money that the tax people
don't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that- And it's
actually written in the rules that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't give out samples and shit at events
like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now is it that nobody can give out
samples or only established shops with
[SPEAKER_05]: licenses can't give out samples?
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is when the established shops
are giving out licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I heard a police officer say that-
Well, you just said- Samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you said shops giving out license.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did say that, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: License shop giving out samples is what I
think I meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I wanted to talk about something
else that I heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a cop say today that if I give you
cannabis, even if I gave it to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: legally, that's a sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a transaction there that can be
considered a sale, even if it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot to be careful about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically that's a sale.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that would just be at the cop's
discretion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what that cop said.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they want to be a dick about it,
they can go ahead and arrest you for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: arrest both of us, me for giving it to you
and you for accepting it, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: we're both over 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and slap, grab a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should just give you guys two mics over
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about like, how does that work
though?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we can smoke with each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess as long as either one of us leaves
with anything, we pass the joint,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I mean, technically like the
definition of a sale is like, Mike,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're the legal guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't give direct legal advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really just, we need more pro
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal law needs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: State laws need to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, marijuana is legal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have pot stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still can't gather outside of someone's
private residence and consume together
[SPEAKER_00]: legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that's still in a gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are busted for distribution for
passing joints to parties or for having
[SPEAKER_00]: more than an ounce on them or for buying
weed that comes in multiple bags or for
[SPEAKER_00]: owning a scale so that they can check
their purchase after they buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law needs to change everywhere and
more people need to get politically
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here just got a ballot mailed to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that fucker out and mail it back in
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your state is working on cannabis
regulations, make sure you write in public
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption facilities of some sort,
someplace where you can go and gather and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke, just like you can go and drink beer
at a bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do something just like that in your
bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to legalize cannabis in your
location, let's put something for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: already has the infrastructure for adults
to go out, consume intoxicants and get
[SPEAKER_00]: home safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every place has bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is call a cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabs aren't going to pull up to the pot
consumption tavern or whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: they call it and go, oh, no, you smell
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're driving drunks home,
they're going to be happy to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's no known.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that shit's already in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to utilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the stone people are going to make
more revenue because you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need a taxi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to buy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slop your eyes are as red as that table,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've eaten seven, eight pieces of this
pumpkin bar now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an edible noob, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie's going for more of the coffee one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, grab me a pumpkin piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: Break it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just break it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Spence, is your team winning,
homie?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: My phone's dead, so I can only look at the
score of the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how many.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just watching one person, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Spence is deep in a fantasy football
thing over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear him screaming when I go to the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: If sports are on, I don't even know what
the fuck's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come to my house on Sundays and see how
mad, especially when the Cowboys lose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike breaks out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They lost him over time a couple of weeks
ago, and he literally lost his mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you need to give a man a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody need a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I could go for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get Mike a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smelled an aroma from somebody's dab
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty... I think that was a New
York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's... Is this Live Res or is
this a regular blast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was live.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get Mike a New York City Diesel Live
Res dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like all those words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit is super gold, super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turpadelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpa, turpa, delic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a hit of it and then tell me what you
think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're going to cough for 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what I think of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab report coming in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stupid smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like a... I'll try not to dab the
microphone this time, Jessica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great if you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he got it right this time,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got it perfectly smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know there are any dads sitting
over there at the kids' table?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might've been the biggest dab
I've ever seen you take.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little bigger than standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my own torch now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys at the kids' table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll throw you this container of
some... Oh wait, you want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass that around for Slop and Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy Joe over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy Joe at the kids' table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where else in the world could this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there at the kids' table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got a carb cap over there,
right?
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Toro rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friend, Nikki.
[SPEAKER_01]: She sold me a Toro rig and it's a go pass
little rig, but unfortunately I left the
[SPEAKER_01]: email on and all of the water evaporated
and Slop tried to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I succeeded in taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mike took a dab off of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It explains why your eyes are as red as
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this candy bar that tastes like it
came from somebody's grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they get redder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a good thing or a bad thing when a
candy bar tastes like it came from
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody's grandma?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awful thing because you're going
to eat as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm throwing piece number nine of this one
in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to be wrecked here in
about 30 or 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a really fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we've got to record for a long
time and see what all this stuff does to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how high we get.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't eaten today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I haven't eaten today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you're going to be really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was planning to get some Chipotle
after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, why'd you say Chipotle?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was evil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can go together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just hit pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to Chipotle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody want anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're back from Chipotle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could all go to Chipotle that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know they have like a fax machine
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just like fax them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an app now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wife uses it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody delivers some Chipotle,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dispensaries have that Express app too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can order online ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty spiffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you just go and type in on your phone
like I need two grams of hash and a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter of good nugs and four Incredibles
and I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have it in your bag, in a bag with your
name on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stapled with your name on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You show up and they take your cash and
you leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hasn't ever been better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could do deliveries in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, delivery of cannabis has
been banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a no-no here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cannabis delivery system.
[SPEAKER_01]: In every other state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, in the winter, man, when you don't
want to drive to the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're like, can I just get an eighth
delivery?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Snow outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is drove around at like a wholesale
level, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's regulated in some way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they go around in like an armored
truck?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys all have tremendous
experience in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an outsider just asking the questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just manifested from a place to a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD RX has trucks that are labeled CBD RX,
which is a CBD company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They specialize in mostly CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to ask for permission to
use the men's room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're headed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a left as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: The restroom is really pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD RX cruises around with their label
on their truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have a trailer with just
covered shit on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell it's just product for
days on the trailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it's, you have to fill out
a manifest before you leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the product leaves one building,
you have to fill out a manifest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of product, the car license plate,
the driver, and something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even the route you're going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The route that you're going to take has to
be documented.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can't be like, off like if you
get caught like 30 minutes off of your
[SPEAKER_07]: path, you're supposed to go to,
they could like, say you're doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't stop at McDonald's or nothing
on the way, even if it's like a four hour
[SPEAKER_01]: drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything here is hyper-regulated guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to fax that to the MED
like 24 hours before you leave and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to approve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get the product there,
you have to basically do the opposite of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be assigned by the other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then weighed and then faxed that it
was received.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really track all of the product
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it the seed to sale model.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the minute that we germinate a seed
in the shop, it's under camera and it has
[SPEAKER_01]: a MIPS number and an RFID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be that RFID until harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it gets tested, because
everything has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it does get a test, it'll be tested
under that RFID number.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just another bunch of recalls
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two of them up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two dispensers in Denver gave product that
had whether or not it be PM, pesticides,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever, to another, two bunch of extract
companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was literally probably almost every
extract company, like bigger extract
[SPEAKER_07]: company in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had to return.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had time to scan that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before today's meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the list of stuff that's getting
recalled is big.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how does the cannabis recall work?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the customers that have purchased it,
do they bring back their product?
[SPEAKER_07]: They can take it back to the dispensary if
they've purchased it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be their exchange or a refund.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the products have a batch number on
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can identify which batch it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on your jar and it has
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then
[SPEAKER_07]: hopefully you ain't smoked it all already.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's also two lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that could be a lot of lawsuits
coming around for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be years before these
people find out if they got sick from any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things that they smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how can you say that it was this
batch of hash right here that got you sick
[SPEAKER_01]: after we've done a million dabs in the
past five years?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the hash test dummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's honestly, you were kind of kidding,
but we are the hash test dummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any bad things that are coming from this
cannabis use the way that we're doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to discover them with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be our generation in this movement
that does discover it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have to say either way, I was
extremely happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all that really matters,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put down the rest of that pumpkin
pie delight bar, and it was actually super
[SPEAKER_01]: delightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one piece left.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think somebody should... Anybody can
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we need to crack open more,
there's a strawberry crunch that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: never tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the monkey bar is
delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only want to eat it because it tastes
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: What other reasons do you eat things?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, specifically the medicated bars to
medicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: To get me high as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to get any more high,
but man, that thing's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many milligrams have you had so far?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm 50 in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're going to feel it if you're not
an edible eater.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, I usually save this much for a
plane ride.
[SPEAKER_07]: Say that to the mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some capsules in the car,
300-milligram sativa capsules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not eating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie just leaned her eyeball into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those get me drunk feeling where I can
barely move my hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: My arms and where I sleep for like a solid
12 hours when I actually do fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to eat up in 12 hours from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be somewhere 12 hours from
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time I ate 100-milligram bar,
I had to go lay on the bed and gather
[SPEAKER_08]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of going to lay down,
let's give a big shout out to our buddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not here recording with us tonight
because he had shit to handle,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not a problem, but let's give him
a shout out for the time that he did have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go lay down on the show because he took
a fat dab and turned green and had to go
[SPEAKER_01]: lay down on the couch over there and take
a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I killed the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt kind of bad, but I was laughing at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lived through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make friends with him on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie's about to take a hit out of the
Elevate knockoff, the fake mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clinda.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, my name's stuck on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I called it the Clinda.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, we might switch that email
over here to the little hitman because it
[SPEAKER_01]: hits a little better, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a little meaner rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a mothership knockoff, I feel like I
did all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, make sure you check out Elevate
Glass in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not sponsor the show, but they
have good glass at reasonable prices.
[SPEAKER_08]: In one go, you're like, you mean that
knockoff?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, everybody go check out Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a mothership, so it wasn't 2,500
bucks and it hits just like a mothership,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it was worth the $250.
[SPEAKER_01]: $250 or $200 or whatever it was worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a knockoff, but it works the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know any better, you don't
know any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know them, jeans is Gucci.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to take a dab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel those edibles starting to creep up
in the back of my brain and I like what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be high school high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy, your eyes look like high school
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have no way of directly telling
apart the edible high versus the dab high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, I feel like when I'm on an edible
high, my body feels slouchy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my body just feels like- Y'all feel
that with sand or something over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: A little of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know them weights they put on Samurai
Jack?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting my training on- Do we need to
get you a seatbelt for your chair,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might need to get a cab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get everybody home safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw somebody get a DUI on Periscope
the other day, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were drunk, don't drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: How drunk can you be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were retardedly drunk,
don't drink and drive and Periscope at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same fucking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people saw this girl Periscoping and
driving drunk as hell and they called the
[SPEAKER_01]: cops on her and the cops pulled her over
on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to see the red and blues pop up
and she goes, I have to get home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way the video ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt so bad for that young girl,
but it was kind of funny and kind of sad
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drink and drive, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have to learn their lesson somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm happy that she didn't learn her
lesson by hurting somebody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or herself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or herself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least that officer pulled her over.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Periscope people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope police out there, hun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope police.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of people that follow me on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to give them all a shout out,
but I'm sure that I'll skip one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not even going to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any papers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would roll a blunt, but I know you're
not part of the dark side.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that cabinet right in front of you,
there's a grinder with papers attached to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the... Oh, Buzzy's got a
cannon rolled already of some gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_01]: number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy's got some Nigerian... Some other
stuff mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy just pulled out some Nigerian
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys call that when you roll
it around like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some moon rocks or caviar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, grab the mic, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to ask you some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moon rocks, caviar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moon rocks, caviar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Nigerian nightmare is the bud,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what happened to it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I took a bunch of oil and put it
on a hot plate to get it melted down and
[SPEAKER_08]: liquidy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I rolled the noug around in it
and dropped it in a Mason jar full of keif
[SPEAKER_08]: that I got from a pollen box.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I shook the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then now it looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard and crunchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I checked it out a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys call that caviar or moon
rocks?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lighter in that same room in
front of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a psych ass right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stoner caviar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are papers in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably an elf that knows how to
roll a joint hidden in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping the joint rolling elf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will die with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my prized possessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck are we even talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's episode number 100, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Spence and Matty back from the
Garden of Weed and they haven't been here
[SPEAKER_01]: in a long freaking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys bring the cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plaque.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plaque.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, they give them a square plaque.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a bowling trophy now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a plaque with a picture of a trophy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's there in spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably got tired of making a bunch
of cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when they commented on it,
they said that we didn't enter... What was
[SPEAKER_07]: it?
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD isn't considered a... Oh, it's a high
times award.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a cannabis cup award.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which... How much sense does that make?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you take the actual medicine and you
separate it from all the other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it kind of sad?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a guy quiet like you're
kicking puppies or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go dissing high times
because they do a lot of great things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sometimes it feels like they're doing
some sketchy shit sometimes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just a lot of stuff behind the
scenes that we don't know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Danny Danko for listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys got... I'm going to say you
guys are cup winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys want a cannabis cup in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cup.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis plaque.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the first black dude to win a cannabis
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty damn close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would the first black guy to win a
cannabis cup, what would you drink out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis cup if they had given you a
cup?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably like a 40.
[SPEAKER_07]: A 40, just pour a 40 on it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my boy right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spencer's definitely the first black guy
to win this secret cup though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there for that one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie, if you would have brought home a
cannabis cup, what would have been the
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing you would have drank out of a
cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look all shy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably would have put like a stupid
margarita or something in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe a smoothie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your homie's pouring a fucking 40 in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a margarita or a smoothie in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know what Mike would drink out
of a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike would drink a Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you drink out of your cannabis
cup, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we be totally honest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you want, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your own cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liquid acid would be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going hard on this motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I do not condone or recommend
you drinking a cannabis cup filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a horrible time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 40 would do you just nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe put your finger in the acid and then
fill it up with some grape juice or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sprite with a couple drops of liquid acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass the mic over there to our homie,
Buzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Buzzy, if you want a cannabis cup
right now and you could fill it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: anything and take a drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have an answer, but it only
makes sense to a few people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have to be a kale shake.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was either kale shake or like
Starbucks drink for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: A giant frozen mocha drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we all don't have cannabis cups
because they know we'd just be filling
[SPEAKER_01]: them up with lean and drinking out of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That joint smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to steal his plaque.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you would have had your grill when
you won the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned the grill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if anybody finds Spencer's grill.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody knows where it's at,
holler at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit was expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send it to my PO box.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you the address.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit this joint of Gorilla
Glue because it smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tasty too.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100th episode, you're smoking flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had this dab in my hand for like 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy it, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro-dabbing, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just reading an article.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you guys have all heard that
they're releasing like $6,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on the mic just a little tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should just let out all the weed
people first.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say nonviolent criminals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them weren't even convicted,
but they've been in there for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another positive step.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_06]: One step closer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew this dude that was a Marine and he
came back and he got assaulted.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like put the dude in a coma and they
put him in jail and he was in county jail
[SPEAKER_08]: like throughout trial and stuff for like a
year and a half.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, before he even got processed
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the trial over yet?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't keep up with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was just somebody that I knew through
involvement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rough life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just took a fat hit off a joint and
then I took a little decent sized dab of
[SPEAKER_01]: some live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the highest giraffe pussy and I'm
liking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a fun episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may need a seatbelt for my chair before
we go too far here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you're quiet over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind, homie?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike showed up and the first thing we did
was make sure we give him some dabs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Slop said the bowl of acid,
it made me think of, did you happen to see
[SPEAKER_05]: the acid church that happened on Sunday?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: On Joey Diaz's?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody who listens to that out there?
[SPEAKER_07]: To like church where you take acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually these guys have a podcast
called The Church of What's Happening Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Joey Diaz and Lee Syatt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Joey Diaz, Lee Syatt and Ari Shaffir
went on the podcast and they ate acid
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Eddie Bravo.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Eddie Bravo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eddie Bravo did not eat acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to be very clear that he was not
eating acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other three ate a nice dose of acid
and they were tripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were tripping face.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were giggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they went on Periscope a little
bit later and Periscope themselves all
[SPEAKER_01]: tripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ari Shaffir was laying on the floor
rubbing his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee Syatt was smiling the size of the
moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joey Diaz did not seem fazed at all by
all the drugs that they had taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was sitting there eating 500 milligrams
stars, stars of death, the gummy bears,
[SPEAKER_01]: gummy stars, just eating them like they
were candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, they kind of take the edge
off, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all he was thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take the edge off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't even ever eat acid on this
podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
I might.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might just come to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might just pop some in comb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be real entertaining that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulling my drink a little bit closer to me
as everyone's talking about a dose of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's looking down at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, like, I'm not sure if I want to eat
any more of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I leave the room while these were
open?
[SPEAKER_01]: You did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went pee a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be a fun night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a fun night for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we start talking about colors and
shit, you guys, it's because somebody in
[SPEAKER_01]: this room just fed us a bunch of acid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Pixar movies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I start bringing up Pixar movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like Pixar movies, Slop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a Minions fan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you ever, if your first time taking
acid, pop in a nice Pixar movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first time taking acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've taken a little bit too much
from what I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with the greatest people to be ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my every time taking acid.
[SPEAKER_08]: You always feel like you've taken too
much.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the biggest dab you've ever taken,
Sloppy?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure our friend Michael gave me
like a gram dab once.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a gram at the cannabis cup and won a
t-shirt and I almost threw up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost threw up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've almost thrown up both times.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one time that Michael did it was
during the Super Bowl and I literally took
[SPEAKER_08]: the dab stood up in the middle of his
house, took my shirt off and lay down on
[SPEAKER_08]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm pretty sure I took a nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just need a little rest
after a big dab like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if there were to be a dab contest
in the room, I think the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: standards would probably be myself and
Matty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be the first person out for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spint says no shame in saying he does not
take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes to take a whole bunch of little
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his eyes turn as red as
stoplights.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just, he looked into the microphone and
nodded like the microphone could hear the
[SPEAKER_01]: nod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You high over there, my friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the other podcast you were on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Network Radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Network Radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the world's best weed podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best weed show ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best weed show ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on getting myself booked for
that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be on there one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Jason?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Hunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Hunt, I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just random shout outs because we're at
that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the edibles kicking in,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to open another one of these,
you guys, or is everybody edible-eed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie just gave the, if there's that
emoji with the little chick, give yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: a cross out.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you opened it, I would eat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with whatever you're.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should not open it because we will eat
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buzzy finally came in for the last piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been waiting patiently for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's, you know, I eat edibles once
every six months.
[SPEAKER_08]: We might as well do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a big old smile on your face,
Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen you that smile in quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty happy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be in a room full of healthy
people that are taking good care of
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not a bunch of lazy ass potheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are a group of people that freaking
do work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence can hoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence plays some ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you dunk on some fools?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just smiles and nods like, uh huh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have dunked on some fools.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tallest dude I ever dunked on was like
six, nine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was huge, but he wasn't like six,
nine and like, he could jump out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: gym.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like six, nine and just giant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was glued to the ground pretty much.
[SPEAKER_08]: He could dunk because he was six,
nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can reach up and stuff it on him.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many times have you smacked a dude in
the face with your nuts?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero times.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's never happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see it on YouTube all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: People dunking.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the most shameful way to dunk on
somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you meant like really taking my
balls in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, not like teabagging in like sixth
grade or nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about like dunking.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was like in 10th grade,
the summer before my 10th grade,
[SPEAKER_07]: we were playing in a basketball tournament
and I literally caught a ball,
[SPEAKER_07]: took two steps and jumped over a kid that
was like, I mean, he's probably only like
[SPEAKER_07]: six foot, but like I'm in 10th grade and I
literally just Vince Cartered over this
[SPEAKER_07]: dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the referees were like alumni
players, players who'd just come back for
[SPEAKER_07]: summer for money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And literally they just take off running
out of the gym.
[SPEAKER_07]: The referees are like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just jumped over somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really athletic, but I think I'm a,
I always liked weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was never like, besides when I was
younger, that was the only time I didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: really smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: But once I got into like high school and
like college, I continued.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had two scholarships and I was still
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hoop in your high?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I play better when I'm high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It slows down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a musician, sometime it might be,
I'm slowed down, but you can shoot better,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more aim a little like you
get normally time is going by about tick,
[SPEAKER_01]: tick, tick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when he smokes some weed, you get that
tick, tick, tick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're playing music,
I'll take a hit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's smoke some flowers when there's
flowers around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I got to pass it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're back to the where this joint
goes game.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a musician, when you're playing
music, you just feel the time so much
[SPEAKER_01]: better when you're a little high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like that beat is so much
thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got so much more room to play
with that time that's coming by as a
[SPEAKER_01]: musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slop's not in his head.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd like to rap when you're all high
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I probably smoke a blunt perverse
perverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snoop Dizzle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it's just works out that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I won't, I'll put it out and do some
rap spark it back up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like the whole time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't, the blunt doesn't fuck up your
throat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I sound all right, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound good, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yo, I was going to say a second
going, y'all are like, I love weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, we, we should all discuss like,
uh, when we first smoked weed,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's the hundredth episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what brought us to this community?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what was that first?
[SPEAKER_01]: When the first time you smoked weed,
since you're putting us on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna put you on the spotlight.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time I ever smoked weed was
walking home from school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I was in fifth grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: My school was a fifth grade through 12th
grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: In one school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause the community was small and I didn't
really know what the big kids were doing,
[SPEAKER_08]: but they asked me if I wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I went to my friend Demetrius his
house and we went to his shed and played
[SPEAKER_08]: Sega Genesis and smoked blunts while his
grandma cooked us chicken.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I remember it was just,
it just sounded like a Chappelle show.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was chitlins to be specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was the first time I had ever seen
or smelled them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you remember what game you were
playing?
[SPEAKER_08]: We were playing Golden Axe.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the first co-op games on Sega
Genesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we used to sit in that shed and do it
all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was funny cause I was so young that
I didn't know what I did was wrong until I
[SPEAKER_08]: was about to leave when my mom pulled up
and they're like, all right, don't eat
[SPEAKER_08]: anything when you get home and go in your
room and tell your mom you have a
[SPEAKER_08]: headache.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, ah, this seems weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, but that was every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And eventually my mom was like,
why do you have so many headaches?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're laughing a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Life is too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem to be enjoying yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't even know that you were
doing something bad?
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I mean, my mom smoked cigarettes when
I was younger.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I saw people smoking, but not,
I was just like, I wanted to be a cool
[SPEAKER_08]: kid.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fifth through 12th grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was there with all older kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a minority school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I got integrated into, so it was just
like, you know, being the oddball out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, well, that's what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I did it and played those video
games and I was like, this is the shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have been playing video games and
smoking weed since that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games go together so damn well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody else want to tell about the
first time they got high?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, if you don't want to,
Joe, I want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that's pretty basic story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was interested in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hanging out with friends one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people came with weed, got smoked and I
was like, okay, this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see why people enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, just kind of have ever since.
[SPEAKER_05]: How old were you?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't mind me asking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I guess 17.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems about an appropriate age to
start smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't like the first year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really sporadic, just like here and
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was just like a curiosity that
got settled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, then I became
interested in like more than just weed as
[SPEAKER_05]: a cool afterschool activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some other things took its place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, yeah, that's all, that's all for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell by the look on your face,
not to go further with that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Maddie, do you want to tell us about
the first time that you got to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and play with the wonderful world of ganja
and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really, really young.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really say my story on a podcast
because I'm afraid that, uh, might not go
[SPEAKER_06]: so well, but I was really young.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like 13 when I like started smoking
weed, like once or twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer just pointed out that sloppy said
fifth grade and Maddie's afraid to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: her story, but okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know why.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how old were you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was young.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like 13 when I started, I probably
smoked weed before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started smoking cigarettes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up in like a trailer park.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it was kind of like around
the edges.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you live in a trailer park,
you smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started smoking and drinking really,
really young.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when weed was introduced to me,
it wasn't even like a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was just something normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started at the trailer and now you
hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost just like sloppy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just didn't really realize what I was
doing was wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I remember one day I sat in a
dare class because in North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have to go through dare classes,
which is a drug awareness class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug abuse resistance education.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were talking about, they were
talking about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were saying how awful it was
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh shit, man, maybe that
stuff is bad, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already hooked by the time I got in
the dare.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Spence, you know, you're up
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the first time, do you,
what was it you remember about the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time you smoked some weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I smoked weed out of like a spray
bottle when I was in like ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even, didn't even know what
getting high was.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't know what.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was feeling.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I guess, I guess I'm high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I didn't really touch weed until
I was like, I don't know, maybe sophomore.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next year is when I was like actually
smoking, not like every day, but two or
[SPEAKER_07]: three times a week, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever someone's got some weed,
whenever it comes up Friday night or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my interest changed when there,
I found out about GoodWeed when I like
[SPEAKER_07]: first saw like actually like, cause
everybody remembers Reggie, like he smoked
[SPEAKER_07]: Reggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start off with that shitty brick weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you see GoodWeed and it completely
like changes your mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, holy shit, I'll never,
I'll never smoke that again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So weed is how you two started dating?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had really, really good weed and I,
we had a mutual friend and I was like in
[SPEAKER_06]: North Carolina where we lived at the time
was really hard to find weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got some from him and it was like
super, super good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the best weed I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like me and my friend were freaking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we started smoking it and we were
just giggling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you grow that weed, Spence?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like some really good stuff
for where we were at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just started hanging out after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that weed put you two together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: How cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: If he had a, had, if he probably had bad
weed, I don't know, like probably would
[SPEAKER_06]: have tried to hang out with him,
but probably wouldn't have bought weed
[SPEAKER_06]: from him anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That GoodWeed got you a good girl,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, we're going to shift over
to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the first time you ever smoked some
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we thought we were smoking weed when
we were like 12 and 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either the worst ditch weed ever,
or more than likely it was just what some
[SPEAKER_00]: older kids had sold us as weed and was
actually mostly tobacco and like some
[SPEAKER_00]: oregano.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first time I got like really high,
a friend of mine after school when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like 15, I was like, Hey, you want to go
smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought they meant cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got in her car and drove off and I
was like, this is kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were going to go around the
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went to her garage and got stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first time I'd ever smoked
GoodWeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it red hair, which really,
which I think is, yeah, now that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I know about marijuana, like we had
no fucking clue what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just happy to have weed that was
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was stoned out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by this point in my life, I had sat
through dozens of hours of anti-drug
[SPEAKER_00]: education, propaganda nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I finally got dropped off at
my house, I made it inside and flopped
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the guest bedroom thinking that I
was going to die and that my mom was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be one of those sad ass moms that goes
to middle school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, my son started smoking
marijuana and then died like 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: later after a horrible run of addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't do drugs kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I woke up three hours later,
hungry as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the first time I got really
good and stoned.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got more high as you were telling that
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was noticing that my edibles are
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're definitely working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 120 milligrams deep and I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've got your own little guy,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your own little kid,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How old would you prefer him to wait?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's only, he's pint sized now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this water bottle is taller than
Davey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's at least late teens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late teens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let the brain finish developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have waited another couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly for the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I could go back and not do
something, it would be not tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke way too many cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, wait till the late teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your brain finish growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn all the shit they're trying to teach
you in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel if he's in sophomore
year, junior year, and he's killing it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the grades?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's working part time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's all about meeting your
responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then as long as he's going to work at
Village Inn on time or whatever he's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's playing his guitar and doing his
guitar lessons like he's supposed to and
[SPEAKER_01]: his grades are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still snatch it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better make sure you're smoking good
shit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be smoking mid grade in Mike's
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he'd still get in trouble for it and
shit until he was out of my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't freak out if I found out my
teenager was getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, it looks like you got something to
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just grabbed the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to wait, but yeah,
you should explain yours first before I
[SPEAKER_05]: totally change my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the first time I smoked ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was coming out the womb smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born with Fidabrig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I had three uncles who were
pot smoking assholes the whole time I was
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up with, I have an uncle Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out uncle Eric, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't listen to the show, but shout
out bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am kind of a clone of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up to become very much like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hang out with him all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My uncles, Ron Troy and Eric would hang
out and smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a bong that was the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember those old school seventies bongs?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's pistol grip in the
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a carb up here by your thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bull comes out of the middle and then it's
got like a dick mouthpiece that comes off
[SPEAKER_01]: of it and it's funky shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it was made in ceramics class.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would sit in a room and just smoke
out of that fucking bong all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that like weird shitty ceramic
shiny glass looking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to babysit me all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hanging out in that room,
I got stoned as fuck as a little kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't realize that's what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just knew something was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they took me to a concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: My uncles, Eric and Ron took me to a
concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even say the name of the band
because it was some cheesy hair bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go with my uncles and it was in
Long Beach in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were in an El Camino.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a small truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were in the front and I was in
the back and they decided to smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_01]: on the way and play the black album from
Metallica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a life-changing drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what made me a drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of what made me a pothead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so stoned from the joint they
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the smoke blew right in the back of
the fucking vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just sitting there just chief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they knew it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, you got high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I'm fucking high,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like official high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never hit the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they played that black album from
Metallica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time we got back, I was already
figuring out how I was going to go buy
[SPEAKER_01]: that album the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm a Metallica head and I
want to get high all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so- This is life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just changed some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then shortly after that, my friend
Chris Ruth smoked me out and got me stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in the parking lot of my
elementary school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't in elementary school anymore at
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an adult by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoked a joint or a bowl with my buddy,
Chris Ruth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, probably, how old was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say seventh grade because I
left California before ninth grade,
[SPEAKER_01]: before 10th grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: How old was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was about seventh grade when I
first smoked weed with Chris Ruth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't smoke for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would get me so high that I didn't like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought it was funny, but he would get
me so fucking high that I didn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came out here and then I met up with
some friends and they were smoking a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh man, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a hit off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't get stupid high because
they're smoking mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Cali, they're smoking good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear they're smoking shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got some training wheels and I
learned how to really smoke good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm a fucking dab monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really high, but I want to take a fat
dab because this is episode 100,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab of some Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: This slab is vanishing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been dabbing the shit out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, who grew this?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Weedon grew this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Weedon extracted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Team Weedon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some stuff that I don't really,
if anything, it's from us, it's most
[SPEAKER_07]: likely, like 90% of it's grown.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys brought some sour diesel live
resin that is just some fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what this live is you
gave me the other day, but holy shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: that one's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dab alive gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death by lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death by lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why when I hit it, it tastes like a
damn mouthful of lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you got over there, Matty?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some death.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some New York City diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like life by lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no death to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should all exaggerate about how big
this dab is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at least a gram, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I can't do a gram dab and keep
this show going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already fucked up on edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all fucked up on edibles, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel more like Lee Syatt at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody else say something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible how Joey corruptedly truly
took this innocent boy and turned him into
[SPEAKER_05]: a real stoner and psychedelic adventurer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guy went from being afraid to
smoke a joint to eating five hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of edibles every podcast that
he's on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, terrified.
[SPEAKER_01]: He eats more edibles on every show than
we've all eaten tonight combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matty, how much edibles did you eat?
[SPEAKER_06]: At least 600 milligrams or 60 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: 600.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to carry you to the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
60.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a shuffle happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matty just got up and bailed you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, fucking I'm out over this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had enough of this taco stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for not leaving forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dab's working in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody better say something halfway
intelligent.
[SPEAKER_07]: What y'all want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: This room just went silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's episode 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys how many times you've been on
the show, Spence?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably like six or seven times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a moment that stands out to
you really well?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: The shows are fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun show, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking big old fatty dabs and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like when Jesse's here because
Jesse gets so high when he's hanging out
[SPEAKER_06]: with all of us because he just keeps
taking dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always tries to say, I didn't eat
anything today, but we know he ate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a big old dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know he ate a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know he ate something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buzzy, you were on one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your favorite moment from the
time you were on?
[SPEAKER_01]: That everybody really heard podcast number
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have never told anybody about
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This episode 100 is all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just totally messed up the first episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people get stage fright a little bit
when we hit record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people go blank as soon as you hit
the record button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talkative people go silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had Buzzy on one night and he
was talking and he just went blank from a
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to piece together two episodes
and we made a great episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't bad at all, but I'm glad you
enjoyed take two.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hadn't dabbed in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I took one and I was just gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a rise, which is straight
sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took a minute to recover.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gained some composure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gained anything back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your second time on the show,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be from any episode, not just one
that you were on, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite moment from the show
so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it just be an all edible high?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you Chinese?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you part Chinese?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any Asian in your blood?
[SPEAKER_01]: No Asian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you look like you might be Asian
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just grandma's edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, not this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody here just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Jesse, we wish you were here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, slack ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had important shit to handle,
so no worries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Slop, I'm glad you're here,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming and getting edible drunk
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a fun night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you've been on the show how many
times, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably like 20, 25 times, maybe closer
to 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many other girls have been on the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I did a live show at another
location and there were two or three women
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show there, but they didn't come
here where we normally record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a show from the, I remember we were
trying to open up a smokers club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing, like a public consumption
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was Misty and Terry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there was another lady on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there've been like three or four,
four or five ladies on the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're the one that's been on the
most.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should do an all girls podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I be that good?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this, desperate dab lives?
[SPEAKER_01]: So myself and you and who else?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to bring ladies.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some girls in the springs that
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Damsel, you're invited to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be on eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a project together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she'll be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I can think of a few girls that
grow that would love to come on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can get them on, we'll do the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let me know whenever two or three
other grower girls can be on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grower girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grower girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the Colorado Springs,
Pueblo or Denver area and you'd like to be
[SPEAKER_01]: on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like we're a game show all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to be on a show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit up either Maddie or myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't give out Maddie's Twitter or
Instagram stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you find this Maddie?
[SPEAKER_06]: I am only on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we find you on Instagram,
Maddie?
[SPEAKER_06]: Losing my voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Maddie, M-A-D-I-G-B underscore grow
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie, G-B grow in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know how to find Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow Mike at Team Weedon 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Weedon 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your new one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought Mike was... He converted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Came from Call Me Big Mike to a Garden of
Weedon related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yours is great, Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to change yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Maddie, G-B, Weedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Maddie, G-B, Weedon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, I thought that Big Mike was a
perpetrator when he first changed it over.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, who's this person?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started looking and I was like,
this is weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was about to hit him up and be like,
somebody stole your identity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone's trying to be the Garden of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be doing none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a seatbelt on this chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm about to fly away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie, you've got a big old grin and
you're like rocking back and forth like
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking Ray Charles over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a piano?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to write me a melody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence needs some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take another dab and then let's
start saying goodbye to all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a whole bunch of cool ass people at
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I want to thank everybody for
coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, shout out to all everybody for
getting out of the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know me, I'm a homebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't be out here, but I'm out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got a garden to tend to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's got a baby to take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took a little effort to get
everybody here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody showed up at 710 on a Thursday
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great team to have on your
arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a dab, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab for Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's already hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just giving him a dab to entice him
to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody over there need a dab?
[SPEAKER_08]: I will never say no to a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's like black.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's black.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that has nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a racial thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't want to smoke that black
slabbith.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's a little scary smoking some
janky hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the best way to handle that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing we can talk about here
for the last couple of minutes on the show
[SPEAKER_01]: while we take a dab and wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be our little wrap up
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a good way to handle that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, if somebody was like,
Maddie, you all right, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you tripping?
[SPEAKER_06]: This happens all the time when people
offer you stuff and you don't want to take
[SPEAKER_06]: it at all and you have to politely think
of a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best way to handle that,
you guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: You literally have to just educate them
for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My new thing is I only smoke stuff that I
know personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where it's grown and processed at.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't know that, then I'm not going
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally think it's rude to see
somebody smoking something bad for them
[SPEAKER_08]: and not inform them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if they get defensive about it,
don't try to be confrontational with it,
[SPEAKER_08]: but at least you can feel good at the end
of the day like, hey, I told that dude
[SPEAKER_08]: he's smoking something that's going to
kill him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if I saw somebody drop some rat
poison in some lasagna and then put it at
[SPEAKER_08]: the table, I'd definitely look at y'all
and be like, hey, we shouldn't eat this
[SPEAKER_08]: damn lasagna.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just think it's wrong not to be like,
I would just look at him and be like,
[SPEAKER_08]: hey, I don't want to offend you in any
way, but I don't feel comfortable smoking
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is why.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because da, da, da, da, da, da.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of looks like boo-boo, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen people just get up and walk
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before his dab is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I, that's would have been
my solution is like boo-boo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, why don't you take a dab of
this and just give that to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And kind of a high pitched voice is always
acceptable as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys get some good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't, don't settle for some crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of you guys just want to get
high, cop a buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't settle for some crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't settle for some boo-boo smoke some
good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some garden of weed and extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should never crackle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes in the summer, it'll crackle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause your fucking crusty ass fingers put
moisture in it, but it should never
[SPEAKER_06]: crackle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put your fingers on all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making snakes out of your hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I even, I was going to ask a question,
but I don't even want to know the answer
[SPEAKER_01]: to my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the other dude's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it to myself one time and then went
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's Drake beefing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Meek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meek.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you on team Drake or team Meek?
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucked with Drake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Meek fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: No new friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you guys were on team Waka
Flocka.
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucked with Flocka the long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you asked who was Drake or Meek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just knew you'd know the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I definitely didn't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see them box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see them box?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they should do it on
pay-per-view?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they don't have pay-per-view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it in the back alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it on fucking the world stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: World stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm calling them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money you got on the slot?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you throwing down?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the fight?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meek is whipping Drake's ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You seen Drake?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been lifting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it Serena?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Serena.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, she like a minotaur.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, the tennis girl?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to prepare for that.
The tennis girl?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: No way.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's crushing him with them thighs.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's working on his lift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you remember Don't Be A Menace In The
Hood While Drinking?
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't Be A Menace While Drinking Juice In
The Hood?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not my friend if you don't know
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the part where the big Hulk
girl's like, that's Drake in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look what I just started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look what I just started in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of myself for that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to, we're looking for sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get that shit going on
pay-per-view, you guys, if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll host that shit, honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we get somewhere to fight, I'll be the
host.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do it at the state fair convention,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be the most black people that have
ever been in that building at one time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Pueblo at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's trying hard not to laugh at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, it's funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can laugh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw the stats the other day about how
many people moved to Colorado in the past
[SPEAKER_07]: year, or from 2013 to 2014, it was 200,000
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how many people came here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Came from different states to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one of those immigrants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said like, I think they said it
was like, I want to say 5,000 people come
[SPEAKER_07]: to Denver that disperse through the state
almost every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I know a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, George and Amanda.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how Adam got here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Team Weedon for bringing me.
[SPEAKER_08]: They brought half of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a town in North Carolina that's
just a fucking ghost town now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so funny now because people that live
in North Carolina, they were like,
[SPEAKER_07]: yo, I might move to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, where are you moving to?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll think about moving to Puebs,
dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's full, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting so full.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, just tell them, go drive around Durham
for a little bit.
But it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think in 10 years, Pueblo will
be as big as the Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll touch pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be like, it ain't going to be I-5
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think people can still move here
from other states and set up a grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: start banging like they used to,
or is the regulation and does the market
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of shut?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that is on the down, like it's
coming down, but I still think there's
[SPEAKER_07]: people that are moving here, getting
badges, getting jobs in the industry and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's all they need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just want to start a new life and
it's amazing to do that in this state.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has recreational marijuana because
there's no fear for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people love to move here from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're moving here from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're coming to Colorado,
if you're coming here, if you're showing
[SPEAKER_01]: up here, come get a badge, come get an MED
badge, get a job in the industry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to do your, I mean, grow your
own in your basement, grow your own,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't try to do a big fat commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to bust some shit out because
you're going to get yourself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really cracking down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either you're going to get yourself in
trouble or you're going to fail and lose
[SPEAKER_07]: money because you think you can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then next thing you know, come harvest
time and you're pulling an ounce of plant
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're supposed to be pulling 10
ounces.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's things that like, you know,
if you do your research, you can
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely grow your own weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's nothing wrong with everybody
growing their own weed in their house or
[SPEAKER_07]: like in a tent or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when it comes to like thinking you can
come, like I came two years ago and I was
[SPEAKER_07]: late.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's people in the mountains that
have like 60 K garages and that's what
[SPEAKER_07]: they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody here has got a weed guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think you're going to move here
and have somebody to sell your weed to,
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you that person has like 10 other
people that they go and get weed from.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the drought happen with all of
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, oddly enough, there is a drought
here in Colorado right now for some
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are chopping shit down right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about time to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Croptober is upon us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Croptober everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are sitting around right
now, trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're getting plenty of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any while you're trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're smoking some scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Mike's favorite part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some fucking rosin out of that
scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, trim bins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever use trim bins, dog?
[SPEAKER_07]: Trim bins are off the fucking chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a lot of resin in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bro, like so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to trim bins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and if you like raw, like I have
like, I probably got like right around an
[SPEAKER_07]: ounce of pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would melt, but it's a little
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you would rosin tech it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just ain't got around to doing it yet,
but it's still like extra, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: we pay 50 bucks, but I got to zip a,
you know, trim bin key.
[SPEAKER_07]: That 50 bucks has been paid for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hers is too small.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not big enough to juice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always weird when you come home and
you see your hair straightener like in the
[SPEAKER_06]: kitchen and you're like, uh, what happened
in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was making rosin, girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt weird buying a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even try to go get one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew it wasn't for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody make a meme out of that if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a birthday present, sir?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need a gift wrap?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making drugs, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that when you go to Bed Bath and
Beyond, that's the right store,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the dab torch right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the baking mat right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a slick press.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know exactly what's going on or
they've done, they've got a computer that
[SPEAKER_01]: tells them what's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've sold 1 million torches this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that bought the torch also bought
this baking mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that bought this baking mat also
bought this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they do it in a computer and
then like put them next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence, you look exhausted, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, that was inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just stretched and grew an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still over there, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just took like a brief nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's time to go, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was episode number 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody made it through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like slouched over in my chair.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everyone listening to this got as
high as we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are wrecked right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope somebody's melting into a chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I ate 120 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been recording for an hour and 11
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means about an hour ago,
I probably ate that shit-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a good rest of the
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely food and cartoons in my
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Chipotle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a long ass line at
Chipotle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stone ass bastards at Chipotle here in
just a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Chipotle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody's bathroom later.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 101 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come to you on a beautiful Friday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a gorgeous Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody's having a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what you're doing, I hope you're
smoking something delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're taking a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're eating some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got a tasty bowl packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got a vape loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you do it, I hope you are
consuming some cannabis with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it is Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just after 4 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm slightly dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night was an amazing night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see the legendary reggae band
Israel Vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel Vibration was solid and on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I feel like it's probably
getting close to the end for that band.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be one of their final tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little rant about Israel Vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel Vibration is a Jamaican reggae band
that actually met in an orphanage for
[SPEAKER_01]: children with polio.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were three members of Israel
Vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of them had polio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several years ago, one member left the
band and now there are only two dudes
[SPEAKER_01]: left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my opinion that one dude looks like
he is done touring.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look on his face during the show just
looks like he's struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The polio is getting to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kicking his ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other guy looks like he's doing pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets around quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he wants to tour anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the other dude is dragging
him out on tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you can't be Israel Vibration
without both of us, so I need you to come
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what it looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may actually catch Israel Vibration
again tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of depends on how things go.
[SPEAKER_01]: After recording here, I'm going to see
what time it is and see if I got anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: that wants to go with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may go see some reggae tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, shout out to Israel Vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the Roots Radix band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I caught one of the final
tours that these guys are going to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they did one of my favorite
songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did Herb is the Healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The encore, they did Red Eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big shout out to the Ogden Theater for
not kicking me out, for smoking a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of weed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one security guard gave me the look
of, hey, chill out on the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty much all they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't take my shit from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't kick me out, so much respect,
much love to the Ogden Theater and Israel
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, before I get too far,
let's do some shout outs and give some
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I need to give thanks and a big
shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, everybody
involved in the Mystic Roots crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Stay Positive Productions,
all of those kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, I got mad love for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got much respect for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys check out the Mystic
Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me play their music on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't ask for anything in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them a shout out because they're my
friends and I support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They support positivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They support reggae music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, Catherine Ramirez is the
most beautiful woman in reggae,
[SPEAKER_01]: so make sure you check out the Mystic
Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Ms. Catherine Ramirez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Coot Dogg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good positive shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, let's give some shout outs to
everybody that showed up for episode
[SPEAKER_01]: number 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give them a personal thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a hell of a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have got a little bit too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if the show got off the rails
a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it goes when everybody's
here and we eat that many edibles and take
[SPEAKER_01]: that many dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to send a huge sincere thank
you shout out to Spence and Maddie,
[SPEAKER_01]: also Sloppy and Joe, and also a huge shout
out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody took time out of their day to
come here and be on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super cool of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to a
couple of brands and sponsors that I
[SPEAKER_01]: missed on episode 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was focused on having a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that, but I skipped one part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed to give a shout out to my good
friends at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you support Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, shout out to a good friend,
Task Rock and Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Task used to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil Slick used to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all still family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a big shout out to Dougie and the
Hitman Glass crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be dabbing the way I dab
without Oil Slick, Highly Educated,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what keeps me dabbing the way that
I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, big shout out to the Garden
of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Garden of Whedon keeps me well
medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got most of the shout outs covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else do I need to shout out?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who I need to give the biggest,
hugest thank you and shout out to?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that listens to this podcast,
everybody that supports this show,
[SPEAKER_01]: this podcast wouldn't happen without you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it partly for me because I feel like
I have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just comes out of me naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go crazy if I didn't do the
podcast nowadays, but I do it for you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my gift to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been blessed with the ability to
learn a whole bunch about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been blessed to be around people that
love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm very privileged to be in
this position in this industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this state, in this time and age where
I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm really blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I need to share it with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all of you people for
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone that subscribes, everybody that
interacts with me on social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank each and every one of you
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving all of you a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to the microphone fist bump right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fist bump on the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect, much love to everybody who
supports the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All
[SPEAKER_01]: right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's enough shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's enough ass kissing for one
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some business here.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the last episode, we talked about some
more issues with pesticides at a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pulling up the article right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article comes from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, of course, is written by David
Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to make that all into one name
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the Denver Post and of course,
The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline says, Nature's Cure of Denver
recalls pot products containing
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get right into the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, a second marijuana business in
Denver in just over a week has voluntarily
[SPEAKER_01]: recalled its products because they contain
a pesticide not allowed for use on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver health officials announced the
recall by Nature's Cure, which also is
[SPEAKER_01]: known as Colfax Pot Shop, Wednesday,
after tests found high levels of a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide that cannot be legally used to
grow the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recall extends to all of the company's
plant material, as well as its
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates purchased before October 6th,
according to the Denver Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: The business has one retail location at
1500 East Colfax.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pesticide Spiro mephicin was detected
during follow-up tests at Colfax Pot Shop
[SPEAKER_01]: after inspectors found pesticides in
cannabis the shop had grown and sent to a
[SPEAKER_01]: facility for processing into various forms
of marijuana infused products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That facility, Mahatma, has also been the
source of its own recall over pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: An employee who answered the phone at
Nature's Cure said its owners did not have
[SPEAKER_01]: a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recalled products include dried
medical marijuana with cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facility number 403-00651 on the label,
dried recreational marijuana with the
[SPEAKER_01]: number 403R-00035 on the label,
and concentrates from The Lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: Craft 17, TC Labs, Lab 710, or Mahatma
showing either number on their label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, if you have dried marijuana,
if you bought cannabis, that's pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, you guys, if you bought dried
marijuana and the cultivation facility
[SPEAKER_01]: number on the label is 403-00651,
take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bought dried recreational marijuana
with the number 403R-00035 on the label,
[SPEAKER_01]: take that shit back and concentrates from
The Lab, Craft 710, TC Labs, Lab 710,
[SPEAKER_01]: or Mahatma showing either one of those
numbers on their labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, take those products back to
where you purchased them and either ask
[SPEAKER_01]: for an exchange for something without
pesticides in it or get your damn money
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know the return policy on any
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not give you back your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may give you a store credit for a
product, but whatever you do, go exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want to smoke this pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers are urged to destroy the product
or return it to the place of purchase is
[SPEAKER_01]: what the article says.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the second business this month to
issue a recall of its marijuana over
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns that potentially dangerous
pesticides were used to cultivate the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, True Cannabis, issued a recall
on October 13th after tests determined
[SPEAKER_01]: three disallowed pesticides were used to
grow plants that were later processed into
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana infused products or MIPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: As with Colfax Pot Shop, plants grown by
True Cannabis and sent to Mahatma for
[SPEAKER_01]: processing were found contain the
pesticides, health officials said.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been no reports of illness
associated with any of these recalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, in my opinion, it's going to
take a long time for health effects to be
[SPEAKER_01]: noticeable from smoking a pesticide like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist, but these are the
kinds of things that you smoke them today
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't notice it until you're 20
years down the road and you've got some
[SPEAKER_01]: fucked up tumor in your lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some weird cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got something in your mouth that
grew from this pesticide that you smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things will not affect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things will go into your
body and affect your body in really crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: ways and they will affect future
generations of your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be aware of what you're consuming,
you guys, and I don't think that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to start reporting these
illnesses for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody did smoke something with a
little too much pesticide on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got sick right away, but that's very
uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants have been through the drying
and curing phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see, smell or feel this shit on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be lab tested to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: MIPs often contain much higher
concentrations of pesticides than dried
[SPEAKER_01]: plants processed for smoking because of
the method used to extract THC and other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, pesticide levels dissipate quickly
in dried marijuana while amounts found in
[SPEAKER_01]: MIPS typically do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys, that is extremely accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make hash, if you take a bud,
a plant that has been sprayed with
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides and you make hash with it,
sometimes we can see the pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: floating on the top of the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see a little sheen sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see this little greasy layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll make a batch of hash and
let it finish and then you can touch the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of it and you can feel on your fingers
a little oily layer of neem oil or stylet
[SPEAKER_01]: oil or whatever type of oily product was
applied to the plants, botanical oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can see that floating on top
of the hash and it's hard to get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make your hash taste like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be consuming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop spraying your plants with bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I think the point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I will continue with the article
because I feel like I've gotten myself off
[SPEAKER_01]: track.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recall is the fourth announced by the
Denver Department of Environmental Health
[SPEAKER_01]: since it began cracking down on pesticides
last spring, quarantining 100,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worries about pesticides and marijuana
are the result of federal laws that deem
[SPEAKER_01]: the drug illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, safety tests have not
been done on the chemicals when
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically ingested on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana can be classed as either food or
a drug because of various ways it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal law deems it a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: State agriculture officials have proposed
a rule that would limit the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides allowed for use in growing
marijuana to about 75 of the least
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rule would allow manufacturers of
pesticides among the improved products to
[SPEAKER_01]: petition the government to let marijuana
growers use its chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company would have to first approve
the pesticide is safe to humans and the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, growers can use more than 200
pesticides the state says has warning
[SPEAKER_01]: labels so broad that using the product on
cannabis would not violate federal laws
[SPEAKER_01]: that require chemicals to be used only as
directed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, when you open up any pesticide
or when you buy the bottle, there's that
[SPEAKER_01]: little booklet attached to the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you have to do is pop that open and it
unfolds and there are a bunch of rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you how you can apply that
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says what it can be used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says what type of crops it can be used
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has got a window of reentry listed on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will say, if you spray this product,
do not reenter this room for up to four
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you do enter the room, be in proper
equipment, use a ventilator, use some type
[SPEAKER_01]: of covering.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a lot of things written on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do not use that pesticide,
the way that that direction label says to
[SPEAKER_01]: use it, you are in violation of federal
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a farmer in an agricultural business is
caught using those pesticides improperly,
[SPEAKER_01]: he will be fined.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will face a federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: His farm will face penalties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is serious stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not realize how important this was
and how serious this was until I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of training from the Colorado
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you guys, pay attention to those
warnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is serious shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not notice how much risk you are
putting yourself in when you are using
[SPEAKER_01]: these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend that you go and read about
each pesticide that you are using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read about each ingredient in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what it is derived from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what it is going to do to you in
small concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what it is going to do to you in
large concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what you are exposing yourself
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read about what you are putting on your
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are spraying people's—it may be
recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, find out what you are spraying
on the stuff that you are giving to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that you care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are taking money for a product,
if you are giving this product as a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical treatment, you need to take pride
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is your responsibility to make sure
that no bullshit goes into your customers
[SPEAKER_01]: or your patients, your clients,
whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their lungs and bodies should be treated
like a temple, and it is your
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility that their cannabis is
clean and safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that is your job as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, read about all the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to continue and read the last
line of the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Despite the allowance,
state officials have said they do not
[SPEAKER_01]: endorse the use of pesticides on marijuana
because there is no data to ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers are safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice if we did not have to use
any pesticides at all on growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is very unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pests everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are building a new facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our grow facility is—it is basically the
desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a rocky desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of the facility, there are
lizards, there are snakes, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: tarantulas, there are spiders,
there are centipedes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have built this facility from the
ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a sealed facility, and still
occasionally, I will have to escort a baby
[SPEAKER_01]: tarantula out of the building or chase
down a lizard out of the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard to keep shit out of buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insects are much smaller than these
tarantulas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pot pests are much smaller than
tarantulas and lizards, so keeping them
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there will sometimes require some
sort of a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we are going to finish the
building and we will seal it up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard to keep shit out, is my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some type of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some type of prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some type of integrated pest
management system that will keep the bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, that requires some sort of
a bottled pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to use it, you guys,
be responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read about what you are using and learn
what you are applying to your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because I am going to take a quick dab and
a drink, and then we will get on with the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for one quick second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I am nicely dabbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big shout out to my
friend, Maddie from the Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took Maddie a bunch of Girl Scout
Cookies flowers that I grew, and she
[SPEAKER_01]: turned it into some delicious oil for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is some snap and peel, kind of almost
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It snaps a little more than it shatters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little warm in here, so that may
have something to do with it, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes delicious, and it gets me high
as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, a big shout out to Maddie for the
amazing Girl Scout Cookies hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work, girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to bringing you some more
material to turn into hash for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, I have got another news
article on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from our neighbors to the
north out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article was sent to me by our good
buddy, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sending me some news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry you couldn't join me tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is hanging out with his lovely wife
and their new baby, so a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the Mike family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everybody is doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys follow Mike on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: He posts a whole bunch of great cannabis
news, things that will educate you,
[SPEAKER_01]: things you would appreciate seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like I said, this article comes from
our good friends in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada has elected a new prime minister
who seems to be on our side.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article comes from Vice News.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was written by Rachel Brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline says, Trudeau held the best
thing that has ever happened to Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, and the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin Trudeau hasn't even been officially
sworn in as prime minister yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as far as marijuana advocates are
concerned, he has promised to fully
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize it as good as fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of Mr. Trudeau's official declarations
should be the war against cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: By securing a majority government,
the liberals are poised to move quickly on
[SPEAKER_01]: their pledge to legalize, regulate,
and restrict access to marijuana for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use, which Trudeau has built
as a top priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though the incoming prime minister has yet
to specify what exactly legalizations
[SPEAKER_01]: would look like, and it could take years
for it to come to fruition, things are
[SPEAKER_01]: already looking up for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm stuttering in this article,
so I'm going to reach over to my right,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm going to grab some of this Girl
Scout Cookies dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reaching, reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Girl Scout Cookies hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I don't even know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grabbing some of this hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfolding the parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting myself a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to grab the E-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grab the rig that has the
E-nail on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll work a lot better for my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grab the little Hitman rig
with the drop down from Elevate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the highly educated D-nail
attachment to it, which is running to the
[SPEAKER_01]: G-nail box by Emotech and Giddyup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to all the people that got me
doing a fat dab right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a dab and let's cure my stutter
problem on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm carb capping and freestyle rapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm pretty sure I was reading
an article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's find where I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an oddly worded statement there at
the end of that paragraph.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like they're missing a couple
short words here, like thes and ands in
[SPEAKER_01]: some spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canadian marijuana space could be set
for another revolution, Saul said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce Linton, CEO of Tweed, the largest of
Canada's 26 licensed cannabis producers,
[SPEAKER_01]: told Vice News in a previous interview
that the medical marijuana industry can
[SPEAKER_01]: only benefit under a new legal regime,
as it will likely facilitate the
[SPEAKER_01]: production for recreational marijuana,
similarly to the way things unfolded in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that for licensed producers,
which are large regulated and under
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled shipping and accounting
procedures,
[SPEAKER_01]: would be the first choice for delivery
because that's the first methodology to
[SPEAKER_01]: gain control of the supply chain,
said Linton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier this year, Health Canada
threatened to send some RC, it's Royal
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian Mounted Police officers to shut
them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dancing in the streets, said Don
Pereira, who owns a number of Vancouver
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week, Jacobs Securities, a
Toronto-based investment firm that
[SPEAKER_01]: specializes in advising companies on the
cannabis sector, launched a $50 million
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis fund to focus on opportunities in
Canada and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin Trudeau getting elected is the best
thing that's ever happened to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, Cheryl Schuman, founder of the
Beverly Hills Cannabis Club and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fund's lead advisors, said in an interview
with
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice News, speaking of Cheryl Schuman,
I want to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Mickey Martin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mickey Martin and Mickey
Martin Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep going with the article
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys know what I'm talking about,
high five me mentally right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The firm's other lead advisor is George
Smitherman, Ontario's former health
[SPEAKER_01]: minister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Analysts have suggested that a fully
legalized marijuana industry could attract
[SPEAKER_01]: investors from the alcohol and tobacco
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last month, addiction specialists wrote a
piece in the Canadian Medical Association
[SPEAKER_01]: Journal urging whichever party forms
government to move away from cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, but also retain control over
the supply and sale of recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana should it become legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: A frequently cited concern with
legalization is that it will allow the
[SPEAKER_01]: rise of big cannabis, similar to big
tobacco and big alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: These powerful multinational corporations
have revenues and market expansion as
[SPEAKER_01]: their primary goals with little
consideration of the impact on public
[SPEAKER_01]: health, the article states.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that's something that we kind of
overlooked here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started writing all of our
marijuana laws in Colorado, in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: we kind of forgot that big cannabis would
take over and I see it happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's happening here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were tons of shops here that were
mom and pop shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys like myself with some dreadlocks and
some growing skills would grow our hearts
[SPEAKER_01]: out, open up a shop and get shit going,
but then all of the new regulations have
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed people in that realm out because it
is so expensive to open up a shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so expensive to afford all of the
security.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so expensive to pay for all of the
licensing that only rich dudes that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know anything about cannabis can own
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that is not a hundred percent true,
but that is a lot of what I saw happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people that held on,
a lot of people that persevered and made
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the industry, but very few of them
survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Scott Reach for making
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude made it from the beginning,
killing it because if you want to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis entrepreneur, find out who Scott
Reach is and read about that dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how that dude did it and you'll
realize that you can do whatever the hell
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: In August, Trudeau said his new government
would look into pardoning Canadians
[SPEAKER_01]: serving time in prison for
marijuana-related crimes after he repeals
[SPEAKER_01]: the laws in the criminal code.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's going to go and release
Canadians serving time in prison for
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana-related crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their new prime minister is awesome,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine if we got a president
like this in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's highly unlikely, but could
you imagine if that should happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be so amazing if our government
actually governed us in a way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: found favorable instead of government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Governing us in a way that we all feel
like we're getting ripped the fuck off and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's only benefiting 1% of our nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be amazing if they actually felt some
compassion for us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more paragraph in this
article, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been many situations over history
when laws come in that overturn previous
[SPEAKER_01]: convictions, he said, at a campaign stop
in Vancouver, and there will be a process
[SPEAKER_01]: for that that we will set up in a
responsible way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, also make sure you follow the
lady that wrote this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her name is Rachel Brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's on Twitter at RP underscore Brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown with an E at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Canada has basically legalized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new prime minister, Trudeau,
Justin Trudeau, I hope I'm saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin Trudeau says that when he gets into
office, he's going to do what he can to
[SPEAKER_01]: make cannabis legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I heard him say, I didn't hear
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said in an article that I read that
within 18 months of him taking office,
[SPEAKER_01]: he would legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some looking, I did some thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 months after this dude takes office
will be the middle of April.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by 420 in 2017, is that when it'll be?
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017, 420, Canada will have legalized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did that math wrong, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a corrections department.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, that's all I've got
for you this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on the episode about CBD
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and Doug came over and touched a
little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot more stuff to talk about
CBD wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a whole bunch of great stuff
planned for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be back in seven days with episode
number 102.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're interested in
sponsoring the podcast or if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that you would like me to review,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all the information that you
need to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, now that the show is over,
please go to iTunes, go to the iTunes
[SPEAKER_01]: store, search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, find the review section,
[SPEAKER_01]: give me a five-star rating and type in a
little comment and let me know what you
[SPEAKER_01]: think of the show and I will read your
comments on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing what people have to say
about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take your guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's something constructive,
if you hate me, I may ignore your
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, leave a comment there and I would
