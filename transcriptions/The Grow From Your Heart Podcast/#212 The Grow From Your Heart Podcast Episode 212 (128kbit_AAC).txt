[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Throwback Thursday and it's time for
episode number 212 of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming in with a bonus Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, I am not doing the chunk of old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, I am doing something a little
bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to do a garden, first of the
month garden checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a list of things that you should
be checking on in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should check on it more
frequently than you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of the month is always a good
time to do a garden check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the garden checklist,
let me do an update on an old episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: On an episode, I think it was the last
episode with Mike, we read an email about
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the turps loud at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I didn't mention was fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to keep those turps
loud, chop down the plants, cut the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: off the sticks, get them into a bucket,
and freeze them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live resin is made with fresh frozen
material and it is the turpiest shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HCFSC can be made with fresh frozen or
dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to come out better with frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to keep the turps loud,
freeze that shit is your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me dig into the notes I've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to go over some things
that you can do on the first of the month
[SPEAKER_00]: that would greatly improve your garden,
probably prolong the life of some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, and maybe give you a few more
grams per watt in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the first of the month, something I
always like to do, clean my air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a home grow with a portable
air conditioner, you've got that filter
[SPEAKER_00]: that pops right out of the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pop that up, take it to a hose,
take it to a sink, just rinse it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe it off real good, put it right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever kind of air conditioner you've
got, check the filters, see if they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be replaced, see if they need to be
cleaned, see how often it needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done, and do it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first of the month, go check them
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're clean, that's cool,
write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how long away from now you
need to check them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them on the first of next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're dirty, fucking change them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then keep an eye on how long those things
last without getting super dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we should go over before we get
too far, get a calendar, get a notebook,
[SPEAKER_00]: start making some notes, start making some
check marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know when the last time you
did some shit was, how do you know how
[SPEAKER_00]: long things last?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know when the next time you
need to change that bulb or change that
[SPEAKER_00]: filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if you don't write it
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a calendar, make a Google document,
some shit, make some notes, keep things in
[SPEAKER_00]: check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I would recommend,
check your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend getting a lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a lumen meter and a piece of string,
or a lumen meter and a ruler.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're trying to do is put that ruler
and the lumen meter, you're measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance from the bulb so that you can be
consistent so that every time you measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the distance from the bulb, you are 12
inches away or 18 inches away,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know exactly how many lumens
you're getting at that distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use just a piece of string and
hang the lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the string hangs, you go right here
and you're like, oh, that's that many
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every time, you know you're that far
from the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lumen meter, check the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one thing, if you are pumping
electricity into a bulb and that bulb is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost dead, it's still receiving all of
the electricity but it's not putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: the lumens or the par watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're spending money and you're not
doing shit to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just burning money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The box is outside spinning, your power
meter is just going, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So replace that bulb if it's not living up
to your standards, and then write a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark down how long that bulb has been in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you put in a new bulb,
mark it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should only go from one, maybe two
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to let them go longer than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These double-ended bulbs, they just burn
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give you any warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swap them out after one or two crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon filter covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am guilty of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My carbon filter cover completely looks
like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my photography, it looks black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have taken it off and I have cleaned it
with OxyClean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else to do, but I know
it's not filled with dust and dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys need to take that shit
off there and clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys just need to cut it off
of there and throw it away and get a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new one from the pictures I've seen on
some of your Instagrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your carbon filter cover may need to be
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your carbon filter itself may need to be
replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in just a
few more things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your RO filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running RO water, check those
filters and membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be getting funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be sludged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be wasting more water than what
you're actually cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to check on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check all of your RO, the fittings,
the seals, everywhere where it reaches or
[SPEAKER_00]: where it connects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's well sealed and not
leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the glass in your sealed hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got those ducted hoods like a
Magnum with glass in it, clean that glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Debris, carbon filter, dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit flies around inside of there
randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the bulbs cool down before you get in
there and clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unplug that shit, wait like 45 to an hour,
and then get in there and clean the inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of that glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the outside of that glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure that all that ducting is
sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that all of your, let's see,
from the blower or from the carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: to the blower to the ducting to the light
to the other side of the light to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, make sure that all of that is
sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't have any air leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't have any light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the timers for accuracy and
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this sounds like a no-brainer,
but sometimes power goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes equipment fucks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at all of your timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they are set for the correct
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe daylight savings time happened and
you didn't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go make sure they're all set at the
correct time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure they are set for the
correct cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you fucked up something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you had an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got high one night and bumped
into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your smoke alarms and fire
extinguishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that isn't something we all think
about, but if you're growing cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_00]: home or a commercial environment,
you should have smoke detectors and fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguishers on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you gonna do if you have a fire
and you don't have a fire extinguisher?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna burn down the fucking house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be that guy that burned down
the house growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, have a smoke alarm inside the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word was hard to pull out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain have a fire extinguisher outside
of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something does, I don't want it to ever
please John, no fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if some fire does happen in your grow,
you don't wanna run in there and discover
[SPEAKER_00]: it and have the fire extinguisher in there
where the fire is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna be able to kick open the door
with that fire extinguisher in hand and
[SPEAKER_00]: spray the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna cost you your plants,
but you want a house more than any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, check on your smoke alarm and fire
extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that battery is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that smoke detector beeps like
it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your fire extinguisher has
a nice heavy charge on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's still got some juice in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little gauge on there that'll
tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come with a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only last so long until you have to
go get them recharged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, check that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety is important, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using CO2, get your CO2 setup
inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or get it refilled if it needs to be
refilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start refilling it on the 1st and 15th if
it lasts you two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But check everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your meter is working well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it too high and see if it's got a
safety feature on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it while you're there so that if it
does fuck up, you know it's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a safety turnoff when you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can you do on the 1st of the
month?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, checking on light leaks
and checking for carbon filter problems
[SPEAKER_00]: and needing to replace your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something a lot of people don't
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go outside your grow and walk around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for anything that doesn't look or
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for ordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for odd sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for anything that would make you
think, hey, there's a grow in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you walk by, go walk your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go do something random and just walk
around your house a few extra times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look like you're doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go be suspicious at your own house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're actually doing is looking
to see if you can hear, see or smell
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that is involved with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can hear, see or smell
anything, you need to correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can feel something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can feel the ground vibrating
from a blower you've got in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never know what you could have going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go check for light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for smell leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for any damage you may have done
when you were working inside and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you notice it, then somebody
else will notice it because people are
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking nosy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one person in your neighborhood
that wants to catch you slipping for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason and don't give them the reason,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're either going to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do something and they're
going to get nosy and they're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can see it or smell it,
then law enforcement may get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the person that sees it smells it,
hears it, feels it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they are a thief or a crook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put yourself in any
position you don't need to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go out there and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, get a calendar and make
notes of all of these checks and start
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this on the 1st and maybe on the
15th of every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that a few small steps
like this could greatly improve your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's a good idea to go in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: During your light cycle, if it's light
outside, OK, when it's light outside or
[SPEAKER_00]: light wherever else, go in your grow room
and turn off the lights and see if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting any light inside of the room
coming from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you're getting a light leak from
under your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if there's a hole in your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the light will travel down
ducting and right back through your light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflector and the sunshine will work like
your light and you'll be getting sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: in your plants during your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just depends on how your shit's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're talking about check for light
leaks during your cycles in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, my my lights are on at night,
so the sunshine is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunshine is up while my plants are
asleep, so I really have to make sure no
[SPEAKER_00]: sun gets into my grow in my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you've got set up,
but make sure no lights getting in during
[SPEAKER_00]: your dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it may be a good idea to put some
green lights in there and just pop in once
[SPEAKER_00]: or twice and see what the night cycle
feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: How humid is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How funky is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything weird in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention to what's going on in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few things like this would greatly
improve your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may spot something that you did not
know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend that had some huge
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He couldn't figure out what was wrong with
his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was during his day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, turn off all your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked and you could see light just
beaming in through one window where the
[SPEAKER_00]: board wasn't over properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what was causing all of his
plants in one section to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something small could be something
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could save you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could give you some better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that was a quick rundown on stuff
you should do on the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, also I skipped a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small section here I skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrate your PPM meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrate your EC meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrate all of your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also do a water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something in there that you
aren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to adjust to the water
that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do a water test every now and
then and write down the PPMs and the EC
[SPEAKER_00]: and the TDS and see what's in my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just weird like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is always a good time to clean
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a mess you've been dodging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it's the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay your electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay your rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay all of your bills and don't look
suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you keep the grow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like I ran
through the checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I want to talk about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping your garden clean and organized
and keeping all of your nutrients and your
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides all organized is a huge part of
garden cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: An organization is a huge part to me about
having a successful garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about writing everything
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down every feed I give my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down every spray I give my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Google document where I write
some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a notebook where I write some
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My phone is filled with cannabis wizardry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is the garden you are
growing is a reflection of yourself as a
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when I walk into somebody's
garden, I can see the inside of their
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the chaos that is in their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the order that is in their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see their thought processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, they organize their gardens,
their grow lights, their rows of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: how their nutrients are taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a garden is a reflection of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing straight for money and
for greed and for shit purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden will show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from your heart and
breeding with love, your garden will show
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were too chaotic and too fucked up
in your life right now, your garden will
[SPEAKER_00]: show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are focused and centered and doing
things correctly, your garden will show
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the gardens I've been to,
I can see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been to many personal private
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years and years, I was a consultant
here in a small town when the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana boom took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in a hundred private gardens in
this town.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lined up 10 people and then let me
walk into 10 grow rooms and then put the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys in a line up, I could go,
yeah, that guy goes to grow room A,
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy goes to grow room B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably assign the people the
short interview and a little of who has
[SPEAKER_00]: which grow because I think the gardens
reflect ourselves that very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your garden because it is a
reflection of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pride you put in your garden shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows in your finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows in your pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your nutrient decisions strongly
show me what you have in mind for this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows me if you're growing for just
money, if you're growing for quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're growing for patience,
if you're growing for quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrient selections strongly show me
where your heart and mind are in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I'm using VegBloom at a
commercial grow because we are growing on
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also using VegBloom in my private
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also using Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Botanicare at home in my personal
grow because I think it tastes the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives my herb something funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of chicken shit and seabird
guano and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that seed product that's in
there, it really makes my bud taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I use Botanicare because I've
been using it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a lot of other bottled
nutrients and Botanicare gave me the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't spray with ridiculous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feed my plants ridiculous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare is mostly on the organic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some stuff in there that's not,
but most of the products do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the fully organic stuff because
I don't want to do that in my home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I don't need, it's a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel I'm supposed to be doing that
in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think bottles are a little cleaner and
safer for this home that I am in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a farm, we'd be doing no-till all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have a worm farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be scraping up our own chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I use Veg Bloom at the
big grow because it's a big grow and Veg
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom is a really clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are really cool and it burns so
smoothly when you use Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it leaves a whole bunch of
crap behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your garden is a reflection of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients you choose to use are a
reflection of yourself and the pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management program that you use are a
reflection of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when you're playing
with your gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I wanted to talk about,
just kind of loop it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've been taking care of ganja
plants for longer than I should admit
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've been growing and fucking with
weeds since way before all this medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I learn about cannabis and
nutrients and the nutritive cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants, the more I'm inspired to
take better care of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize more that what I put in,
since you feed cannabis plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: infrequently, and when you feed them,
you definitely see results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that I try to pay more
attention to what I put into me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to take in a wider variety of
nutrients and more specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to just pay a little bit more
attention since I pay so much attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm measuring out this much nitrogen
and this much phosphorus and this much
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium and then a little smidge of Cal
Mag and then put in some kelp in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then some microbes also for my plants,
why wouldn't I think about my own body
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't I love my plant like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't I love my branches and my
roots just as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think taking better care of plants
has made me take better care of myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's made me learn a lot more about my
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made me care a lot more about my
health and it honestly has made me think a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more about my hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since water is the only, you can just feed
these plants water for their whole lives
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes me think, should I need a lot
more water?
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink plenty of water, but I could drink
a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably could too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you take a dab, drink a bottle
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three dabs, bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fucking Scientologist,
but do your own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you take some dabs,
drink some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, this is gonna be a
quick Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only gonna be about 18 minutes,
but I hope it was good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good for me.
