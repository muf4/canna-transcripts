[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 180 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat Kuh and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is a beautiful
day today in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've heard me complain about
things like negative 17 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a couple of days that were four
and five degrees, but today it was 75
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees outside and it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were lovely ladies out there running
around in short shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were obnoxious dudes out there
zipping around on motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great day and spring is in the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what comes with spring,
ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Insects come with spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this episode is going to be about how
to prevent, identify, and correct common
[SPEAKER_01]: garden issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will probably be the start of a
series on identifying, preventing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and correcting garden issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now before we get to identifying your
garden problems, I need to give a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to my friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, if you need t-shirts
printed, if you need hoodies printed,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you need stickers made, if you need hat
pins designed and printed, my friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: HandmadeApparel.biz can help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make my iRead Genetics t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make the Grow From Your Heart podcast
hoodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've printed all of my hat pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I can't recommend
anyone better than HandmadeApparel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out, HandmadeApparel.biz,
and let them know Rasta Jeff sent you,
[SPEAKER_01]: and let them know you're listening to the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, last week I did an episode about
mixing your nutrients and properly
[SPEAKER_01]: watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have overlooked a couple of things
that I want to throw into this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I admit that I am not a very experienced
hydro grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not done a lot of hydroponic
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're growing hydro, if you are
mixing up a reservoir and you are putting
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in there and you start running
that for a few days, some of the water may
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to top that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would check daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in there and check to make sure the
water has not gone too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're in there checking,
check the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH may need to be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a daily basis, go in there and check
your hydro tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using deep water culture,
if you're using an ebb and flow,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're using a drain table,
however you're doing it, make sure there's
[SPEAKER_01]: enough water in your reservoir and make
sure that the pH hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it hasn't changed too dramatically and
if it has, fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you may need to add a little water to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add the water, make sure your
PPMs are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your PPMs go too low, you may need to
add a little bit of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful when you do this because in
hydro it is easy to burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I overlooked that you may
need to add water and that when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, adjust your pH and also check your
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else I need to mention about
hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good idea to remix your nutrients
approximately every seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drain that water out of there,
put fresh water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using reverse osmosis water,
if you're using tap water, whatever kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of water you're using, clean it out,
refill it, redo your nutrient program,
[SPEAKER_01]: reset the PPMs, reset the pH and get
everything started for a fresh week.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a really good idea
because your plants want a different diet
[SPEAKER_01]: approximately every seven to 10 days
anyway through different phases of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to require different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't feed your plants the exact same
stuff all the way through veg and you
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely don't feed them the same thing
all the way through bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good idea to change the mix
every seven to 10 days anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time you're in there doing
anything with the water, make sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: check the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize for missing that in the
last episode, but here it is for you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I'm helping you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I don't know if I mentioned this,
but I was mixing up nutrients for my own
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do use bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually trying to lower the pH of a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pH was a little bit too high and
instead of using pH down or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: I use liquid karma from Botanic Air and it
worked very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dropped my pH right to where I needed
it and I didn't have to use a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is actually a useful
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to lower the pH and add
something useful to my mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is shake the shit out of your
nutrients, get that bottle and just shake
[SPEAKER_01]: it vigorously for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just you want to stir it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get everything that's settled
on the bottom mixed back into the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get all the stuff stirred up
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to end up with the last bit
of that bottle having all the potency in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up burning your nutrients
or your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shake the shit out of your bottles
before you use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I feel like it's a good idea that
once you've mixed up nutrients for your
[SPEAKER_01]: potted plants, it is a good idea to use
that mix within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good idea to let that stuff sit
around someone's going to argue me and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, but what about hydro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're mixing that up and running it for
seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is running.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moving constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got oxygen added to it and it's not
sitting still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's constantly moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you mix up a big tank of water and just
let it sit there with nutrients in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those products are sold in different
bottles because they're supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: kept separate until you're using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't mix this stuff up too far in
advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to use it within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it will be more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to brew the synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard that from our friends at
Dragonfly Earth Medicine in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just mix it up right before you're
going to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't use it within 24 to 36 hours,
you'll start seeing it get funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it starts kind of changing colors,
kind of starting to stink real bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: just dump it out, make a fresh mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I got myself caught up on the
stuff I missed last week and I got through
[SPEAKER_01]: a six minute intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a gigantic dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get back, we're going to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about identifying,
preventing, and correcting common issues
[SPEAKER_01]: in your ganja garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I am back and I am
well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a couple of fat dabs of
Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cascade is lemon skunk, cross two day
breaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our friend, the barefoot grower
did the extraction for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hash always makes me go completely
stupid for a couple of seconds when I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are talking about insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the insects are getting bad here
in Colorado because there are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are gardens everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people here in Colorado grow
cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is legal to grow cannabis in your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that everybody should exercise
that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are growing cannabis at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people work in a commercial
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those people are taking bugs from
their home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then their employees and coworkers are
picking up those bugs on their clothes and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking them to their personal grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their friends are coming to their
house and sitting next to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the spider mites are climbing across
the couch onto your buddy's t-shirt
[SPEAKER_01]: because he smells like weed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your buddy's going home and going
in his garden and putting the spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: in his garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bugs are just being moved around
like STDs here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody works in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bugs have no problem getting passed
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means everybody here that is paying
attention needs to be very diligent about
[SPEAKER_01]: their pest management programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to prevent getting pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you've got pests, it is a huge
pain in the ass getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people shut down entire gardens
because they cannot get rid of spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just takes one or two mites to
start the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can get ugly really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a commercial grow in
Pueblo that gave up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't get rid of our mite issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cut down all of their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They closed their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The facility is now for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever buys that place is going to have
to go in there and clean the shit out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it before they're able to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's work our way into talking about
identifying, preventing, and correcting
[SPEAKER_01]: some common issues with our ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've got a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you treat your garden is up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to use harsh chemicals and
harmful pesticides in your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is your decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go a more organic route,
that is your decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just please take some time to read about
what you are applying to your crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: read what it can do to people that consume
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you are applying pesticides
outside, please be much more aware of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please try to use organic ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that you are affecting my
environment also, you're affecting my
[SPEAKER_01]: child's environment, your child's
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're spraying everybody's environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, those are your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows what you're doing to the
overall environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The insects that travel from your property
to mine don't know any barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know any boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever you're doing over there is
going to have some sort of an effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on over here, no matter how
far apart we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please kind of be aware of what you're
putting on your garden, what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying, what you're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you are releasing beneficial
insects, please think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: read about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of be aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I want you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be aware of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing before I get into talking
about these insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started this podcast because there was
another podcast that every time somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: asked a question, the host of the podcast
would pitch products.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would read an email and talk about an
issue in somebody's garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would talk about a very
specific product that would cure your
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would tell you where to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would give you a coupon code to get a
deal on that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt very dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not feel like the host of that show
was trying to improve my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like he was trying to make money
by doing a deal with a pesticide company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will mention products, but I am not paid
by any of those companies to sell any
[SPEAKER_01]: products to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are products that I know will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are products that I use and have used
and have experience with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only reason I'm mentioning them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they work for me and I think
they will work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to sell you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not paid by any pesticide,
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not paid by any grow company at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that a better plan
instead of buying a product and just
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying a product would be to find the
cause of your problem, correct that cause,
[SPEAKER_01]: then eradicate the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you know that it will never come
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you simply say, I've got spider mites
and you walk in and you spray a product
[SPEAKER_01]: and you kill all the spider mites,
good job they're dead temporarily,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're still coming in from somewhere
and you're going to get the same damn
[SPEAKER_01]: problem all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk more about how to
prevent and correct issues instead of what
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy to solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, let's talk a little
bit about spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider mites are probably the most common
problem and pest in most ganja grows and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in most commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's a toss up between powdery
mildew and spider mites in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every grower either has had or will get
spider mites at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something you're going to have to
deal with as a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are over 1000 different species of
spider mites, but when you get mites on
[SPEAKER_01]: your cannabis, you are probably going to
get the two spotted mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the most common mite for your
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may run into a mite known as the
russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That mite is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is way harder to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way harder to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you don't run into those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you just get the two spotted
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about the two
spotted mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two spotted spider mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with talking about how to
identify a mite problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider mites give us plenty of warnings
and indications that they are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're easy to identify once they start
showing you they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll notice the tops of your
leaves look like they have been stippled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like somebody has just been
poking it with a needle and changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a spider mite on the bottom of
that leaf sticking his little fangs in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, sucking the juice out of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants will get stippling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks like you've been poking at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke,
poke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just got little marks on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the first indicator of a spider
mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second sign may be webbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the top of your buds start getting
little webs on there, they start to build
[SPEAKER_01]: like a teepee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks like a little cone around
the top of your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got that on there, you have got
a serious spider mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge indicator that they are
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're loving life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting everything they need and
you're going to have to fight to get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to tell that you've got spider
mites is you may see spider mites on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the underside of your leaf is where
spider mites will live.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be crawling around right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also where they lay their eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mites and the eggs may be visible if
they're there enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to get a magnifier if you
don't have a lot of them, a 60 to 100X
[SPEAKER_01]: magnifier, and just put that on the bottom
side of your leaf and watch for something
[SPEAKER_01]: to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them climbing around,
just little round things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like little monsters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those eggs I was talking about,
spider mites are crazy fast breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they have babies, something fucked up
about spider mites, they have a three to
[SPEAKER_01]: one ratio of females to males.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means when four spider mites are
born, three of them are girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means they're going to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: When spider mites reproduce, they lay up
to 200 eggs at a time and they can repeat
[SPEAKER_01]: that cycle as often as every eight days if
they have the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grow room is the perfect condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in there disrupting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got beautiful humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the perfect environment for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we need to do is prevent spider mites
from getting into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we see spider mites, we need to know
how to eradicate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's first talk about preventing spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Building a well-sealed grow room is a
great way to keep spider mites out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Hello's or Home Depot and get some
of that expanding foam insulation and
[SPEAKER_01]: spray that in every crack in your wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, nothing can climb through those
holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider mites are tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come through every crack,
every nook, every cranny, and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put up some panda film, use a bunch of
tape, seal off that grow room so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have way less entrance routes for spider
mites to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come in from the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also going to come in on your
clothes or they're going to come in on an
[SPEAKER_01]: infested plant or through your ventilation
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need to do is any time you get a
new clone from anybody, if it comes from a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, if it comes from a dispensary,
if it comes from some dude on Craigslist,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever you take that plant before you
put it in your garden, make sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: treated properly for bugs and mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to trust your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think you can trust the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you can trust that guy off of
Craigslist, but you have no idea what they
[SPEAKER_01]: might not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have powdery mildew and they
don't even know it and they just passed it
[SPEAKER_01]: on to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gave them money for a clone and
you actually just paid for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a free collection of spider mites
with your new clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you get a new clone, take it to
wherever you're taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grow facility, your home,
your trap house, your whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put it in with the rest of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it to a quarantined area and spray
the shit out of it with some products so
[SPEAKER_01]: that way you can make sure there are no
mites on it before you put it in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyrethrum is a great product for spider
mites, although some spider mites will
[SPEAKER_01]: develop a resistance and an immunity to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should work for most of your mite
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evergreen Pyrethrum is the brand I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can use a product called Smite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smite is a natural product made of mostly
plant oils and it is actually allowed and
[SPEAKER_01]: approved by the MED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of the products I just listed are
allowed and approved in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: production facilities so they have been
deemed safe by the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture for cannabis plants that will
be consumed by humans as a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two products are deemed safe by
the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I would not use them if they
were not deemed safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would remove them from my personal grows
and they would have to be removed from any
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial grow I am a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Evergreen Pyrethrum and Smite for
plants that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you are an Azamax user,
Azamax is a perfect thing for plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure you treat the clones that
are coming in with some sort of miticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever level of toxicity you want to use
is up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go gentle, I'd recommend
the Smite.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to use something a little
stronger, maybe Azamax.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go real strong and get
crazy with it and make sure nothing ever
[SPEAKER_01]: lives in your garden, go ahead and hit it
with Floramite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't endorse Floramite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a potent product and
it's actually banned by the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot use Floramite in a commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it online if you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever products you choose to use,
please go to that product's website and
[SPEAKER_01]: read the proper application technique and
methods for that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may think, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mix it up with water, put it in a
sprayer and fucking spray it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some other steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Floramite needs to be pH adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Floramite needs to be added to water at a
very specific temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of extra ingredients
for Azamax that you've probably never read
[SPEAKER_01]: and aren't even aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, make sure you wear the appropriate
clothing and protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal protective equipment is very
important when you're applying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are applying something that is very
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are moving it from the bottle where
it's concentrated and diluting it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that concentrated point, it is very
dangerous and it is very potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear something to protect your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those nerdy looking science lab goggles,
get a pair of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, protect your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go somewhere and get some of those black
nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect your skin and hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're spraying, wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear a respirator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always wear long pants and shoes when
you're applying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover yourself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to eradicate pests, not yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's enough about treating
clones that are coming in to not bring
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites on your new plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, don't drag spider mites around from
your friend's garden to your garden or
[SPEAKER_01]: from the commercial grow where you work to
your personal garden or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change clothes when traveling from one
garden to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to change your clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to change your shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to dedicate specific shoes to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got grow shoes and normal shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wear the same shoes in the garden
that I wear at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wear those shoes out and about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be as careful as I can because
I'm in different gardens all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing we should talk about is some
sort of a filtration on your ventilation
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got fresh air coming into the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need filtration on there, especially
if the air is coming from outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're bringing in air from outside,
it definitely needs to be filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to bring in, maybe one of
your neighbors has a mail plant outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to bring in pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to bring in insects and you
don't want to bring in mold and mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever else you could possibly bring in
from outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't invite problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're bringing air in from outdoors,
run it through a HIPAA filter first or get
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself one of those shroom cloud
filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just goes on the ducting and it makes
sure that nothing can pass through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a HIPAA filter and everything
gets caught as it comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you're bringing air from one room
to another, just put those little ... You
[SPEAKER_01]: can buy sheets of HIPAA filters at the
hardware store and you can cut them to the
[SPEAKER_01]: size that you need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a strip of duct tape around the edges
to where you make a little frame and then
[SPEAKER_01]: just duct tape that shit or staple gun
that shit right around all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: ducting, any in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just duct both sides, put a piece on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to slow down the air too
much, but it will stop bugs from moving
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to stop spider mites from moving
from room to room and we have to control
[SPEAKER_01]: them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some HIPAA filters and some shroom
cloud covers over all of your intakes and
[SPEAKER_01]: outtakes and all of your holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would help you a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing you can do to try to
prevent getting spider mites in your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room is if you've got pets, if you've got
a dog, if you've got a cat, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend keeping that pet away from the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to have their dog in
the grow with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think your dog's probably got bugs on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bring them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't wash your dog every time you
come in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been out rolling in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been out playing in the grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows where he's been?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking dog's out running around in
the yard, chewing shit up, shitting on
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, getting spider mites on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let him in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have talked about spider mite
identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have talked about preventation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prevention?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said preventation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to edit it because that
was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it like I meant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about preventation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my new word, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody put that on Wikipedia and in a
dictionary for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preventation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't write down preventation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to look because I was like,
if I wrote down preventation, that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about identification and
prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about eradication,
to eradicate spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several ways to go about getting
rid of your spider mite problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on what stage of growth
your plants are in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the veg stage, it's going to
be a simple solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were in flower, it's going to take
a little bit of consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you need to decide if you want to go
organically, if you want to use beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects, or if you want to use harsh
chemicals so that you can be sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is gone in one application.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I recommend mostly organic
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you get later into flower,
I would recommend the beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_01]: and predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about things you can apply to
your crop in veg to get rid of spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites if you do see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you can do that works
immediately, you can pull off a leaf that
[SPEAKER_01]: is infested with mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just grab the entire leaf,
yank it right off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's not even part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that in a trash bag, seal that trash
bag up, remove that from the grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just taken care of those mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably more mites somewhere,
but at least you've gotten rid of that
[SPEAKER_01]: little colony, that whole leaf worth of
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this from day one all the way
up to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just pull off leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't do much damage to the plant if
you leave enough leaf for the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid, just go in there and
defoliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This applies to powdery mildew also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to just pull off those infected
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So defoliation is your very first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free, it's simple, and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your next step, you can think about what
you may want to spray onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply things like we talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the pyrethrum spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use Smite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use Azimax.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a thousand products in between
that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mighty Wash works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a whole bunch of other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read about what you want to do if spraying
is the way you'd like to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like you want to spray,
but you aren't interested in using a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially made synthetic pesticide or
an organic pesticide, you can make your
[SPEAKER_01]: own worm compost tea, and you can make all
kinds of teas and apply those to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those beneficial bacteria that come
with those teas may run off your spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot guarantee it, but I know it's a
possibility if you use the right products
[SPEAKER_01]: in your tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something I am completely
experienced with, but as I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, I'm sure that Sean and Will and Frosty
would all be yelling at me, and they'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, bro, just make a fucking tea and
spray it on those fucking plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you don't have to use any
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tea would probably work for you to
control a spider mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it would completely
eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're talking about teas,
put a little neem or caranjamil in that
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to knock out your spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to talk about botanical
oils and stuff like neem after I talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: In flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're in flower, you don't want to
spray things onto your plants because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fuck up your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make your buds taste
terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to stay on your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're in flower, you're going to
need to consider how far into flower you
[SPEAKER_01]: are, how far away from harvest you are,
how dense those buds are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to think about when you apply
this pesticide, is it still going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: there when I harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to leave residuals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to make my buds and or
concentrates taste funny?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stuff you need to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it harmful to humans if they do consume
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all things you need to think
about early in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be able to get away with
spraying after week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not even consider spraying
something on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I may spray some fungus tea and some
push on the plants after week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use push one time at the start
of week four, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that everything you spray on
these plants is going to end up in your
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you plan on making hash, I would not
recommend using neem oil or other
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oils or botanical oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your hash and your concentrates
will taste like those oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just talked about not spraying your
plants and you've still got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what the fuck am I going to
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've still got an option for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where beneficial insects come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use beneficial insects from the
very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use them in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use them as preventative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order them online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually recommend, I've got this
catalog in my hand right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm turning to the front page.
[SPEAKER_01]: This company is called Arbico Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not pay me at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really enjoy this catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: This catalog comes every couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first page has a what is IPM
little lesson here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a one page on what is integrated
pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may actually turn this little leaflet
page into an entire episode in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this magazine, and once again,
they don't pay me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, this sounds like a fucking ad,
but it's genuine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this magazine, I've just opened it up
to a couple of pages right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order praying mantis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order green lacewigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order assassin bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order minute pirate bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are aphid parasites, aphid
predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's where I'm headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this magazine, you can order predatory
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are spider mites that do not eat
cannabis plants, but they do eat other
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you order these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in little packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in a variety of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them delivered in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other companies do them other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I'm most familiar with and I like
the best, they come in things that look
[SPEAKER_01]: like a tea bag and they have a little
hanger on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just hang that from your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the predatory mites will come out when
the lights go off and they'll get hungry
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll go running around looking for
something to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to find your spider mite
infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 90% of the time, these predatory mites
are going to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying earlier, you can use
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can introduce predatory mites and any
other sort of predators into your garden
[SPEAKER_01]: as early as you would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use these year round indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, they are ideal for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're best for outdoors because they're
only going to destroy your predatory or
[SPEAKER_01]: your damaging spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going to mess up your
atmosphere, the ecosystem, the
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to eat the spider mites
and you won't even notice they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about some of the predator
mites that I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm working with a commercial
cultivation center with a lot of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got well over a hundred lights in
there and they're integrated pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to mess up the name of this
guy, but he is called the Swirsky mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's called Swirsky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it pronounced multiple
different ways, but the Swirsky mite is
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that I release quite frequently
in the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, another predatory mite that we use
in the commercial grow is a guy called the
[SPEAKER_01]: persimilis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is actually known as phytosilius
persimilis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about the names.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you see these in the catalog or
online, you'll be able to order it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one you're looking for is spelled
P-E-R-S-I-M-I-L-I-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the persimilis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Swirsky again was S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got one more predatory mite
for you to help you get rid of spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy is known as the Andersoni,
A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N-I.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these guys together will eat up all
of your spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very effective and it is very
eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So order these spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have it set up to where they come at their
scheduled interval so that you remember to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply them to your garden at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So set up a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like a subscription is what
you might call that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set up your subscription.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will come in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to open the box and then you'll
just find however they're shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ship in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, a lot of them come in little
tea bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them come in little satchels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just however they come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a sachet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put those at the bottom of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you lollipop your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some naked legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right where the canopy starts and
there's foliage, hang those bug packs
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can afford all three, if you choose
to use all three of these spider mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put one of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pick a spot maybe every six or eight
feet apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on how big your garden is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pick an interval and just put one of
each of these packages in that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your little army of mites will start
coming out and they'll just start finding
[SPEAKER_01]: little food sources and they'll start
eating the shit out of all your bad spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully they will get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's one thing I need to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use beneficial insects,
you cannot spray pesticides because it
[SPEAKER_01]: will kill your beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to mix a spray with beneficial
insects, you need to learn what will not
[SPEAKER_01]: kill those insects that you can spray onto
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're using a Swirsky mite and
you've got a spray that you can apply to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants that the mite needs to take a
bite out of a plant before it is affected
[SPEAKER_01]: by that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would be able to apply that to the
plants because the Swirsky mite is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take a bite out of your cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not hurt your Swirsky mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you sprayed smite on the
Swirsky's, it will kill them because it
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly works by suffocating the bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to think about what you're
going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read as much as you can and plan ahead
because these insects, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable, but they are not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to buy bugs and release
them and then kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems a little counterproductive to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we have identified spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have learned how to prevent spider
mites and we have learned how to eradicate
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're gone, you have to think about
how you got them and you have to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they got in through a crack in the
wall, if they got in through a clone that
[SPEAKER_01]: you brought, if they got in on your
dreadlocks because you've got spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: at the commercial grow, however it
happened, make sure you correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you start doing things to
prevent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work in a commercial grow,
if you're around other grows, if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow consultant, if you're in the
marijuana cannabis industry, wherever you
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you're going to have to take stronger
measures than most folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to start releasing these
predator mites in your own garden every
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks just to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to start spraying something
at the first and 15th of every month to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you don't get an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you do see a sign of spider
mites, you cannot put it off until
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow because they reproduce more
quickly than rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it off until tomorrow and
then tomorrow those spider mites will have
[SPEAKER_01]: enveloped that entire plant in a web.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll look like you're growing cotton
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see spider mites, get in there
today and deal with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let the spider mites win.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting out of hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on from spider mites a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys been going for a little while and
my throat's starting to burn out and I
[SPEAKER_01]: still want to do one, maybe two more
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get down to fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats are super easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little black flies that fly around
your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you water, they probably come flying
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk up to the plant and just tap
the root ball and tap the soil or tap the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot, they'll probably come flying out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably all over your grow by
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see them, they're fucking annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats are also very easy to prevent
and get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: One very helpful way to prevent from
getting fungus gnats is to keep your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: dry at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats like a nice moist area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you let that top layer of the soil
dry out, they won't want to come around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another good way to prevent fungus gnats
that seems really easy but some people
[SPEAKER_01]: might overlook is a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a screen on every window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also those HEPA filters we were talking
about for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that stuff is applicable for a
fungus gnat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little flying insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get in any crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come through any window.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to come to the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to come land on your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They breed in the top layer of soil and
then they fly away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their only purpose is to breed and
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats don't have any other purpose
except to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we've put up a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten rid of any excess moisture in
the top layer of our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have prevented fungus gnats from
coming around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next couple things I'm going to talk
about can work as prevention and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: also work as ways to eradicate the fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to use these products before
the fungus gnats get there, you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you want to wait until you already
have them, that's also an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that is very affordable,
if you have a small personal garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use what are known as mosquito
dunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them at every hardware store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them at Big R.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little round donut looking,
cookie looking things that are used to
[SPEAKER_01]: drop into like a pond or standing water to
keep mosquitoes from gathering around that
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I like to use them to get rid
of or prevent fungus gnats is I will fill
[SPEAKER_01]: my reservoir with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will mix my nutrients just like normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I just drop the mosquito dunk right
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it soften up for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wear rubber gloves and just
grind it up into a small powder to where
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of just dissolves into the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I'm watering the plants,
I make sure to kind of, I push it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: side and make sure to get a little bit for
every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of that stuff that I can see
goes into each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would assume that the smaller stuff
that broke up that I can't see is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: even more distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like that there's some that I can
see so I can judge a little bit of how
[SPEAKER_01]: much I'm putting per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mosquito dunks are very affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're available at most of your local
hardware stores or your feed stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you've got like a ranch store or
something around you, they've probably got
[SPEAKER_01]: them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another product known as Natrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natrol is the same ingredient as the
mosquito dunks, but it is much more
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated and it will definitely work
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use the Evergreen Pyrethrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will work as a drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will tell you how much Evergreen to put
per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply that to your soil as a drench and
that will remove your fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use a product called
Grandivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grandivo will work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use the Evergreen and the Grandivo
together, you will get rid of your fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats forever in two applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be preventative and you
don't want to use a beneficial bacteria or
[SPEAKER_01]: a spray pesticide, you can use
diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diatomaceous earth has little sharp points
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little rough textured little it's
like little rocks or it's like really
[SPEAKER_01]: sharp rice krispies or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply a layer of that to the top of your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover the soil completely and then the
bugs can't climb in and out of there
[SPEAKER_01]: because it cuts them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills them when they try to get in and
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want anything to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hint, wait for the soil to dry mostly
and then apply the diatomaceous earth onto
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it sit as long as you can before you
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing you can use to keep these
fungus gnats away is a product called
[SPEAKER_01]: Spinasad.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of products that contain
Spinasad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monterey Garden Spray does contain
Spinasad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spray that on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a soil drench with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, here's something that I should
mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to use the Evergreen
Pyrethrums or the Spinasad as a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: drench, you should also spray the foliage
because those fungus gnats are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fly out of the soil there and they're
going to land on the leaves and just chill
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and start living there for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to do a soil drench,
also do a foliar application of whichever
[SPEAKER_01]: product you choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's the Evergreen Pyrethrums or if
it's the Spinasad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spinasad from Monterey Garden Spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about one more thing with
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You knew this was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 100% organic way to get rid of your
fungus gnats would be Fungus Gnat
[SPEAKER_01]: Predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to read you the name out
of this catalog, but it is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it would read Hypoaspis
Miles to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Hypoaspis Miles Fungus Gnat
Predator, I'll spell it for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: H-Y-P-O-A-S-P-I-S, and then the word
Miles, Hypoaspis Miles Fungus Gnat
Predator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those would be the beneficial insects I
would recommend to control and eradicate
[SPEAKER_01]: your fungus gnat infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I feel like that
pretty much covers spider mites and fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, at the top of the
show, I know I said I was going to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: cover three topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I said I was going to try to get to
whiteflies, but I've been going for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, my throat's getting a little
bit tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of faking it and just phoning
in the last half of this episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make whiteflies the first
issue we deal with on the part two of how
[SPEAKER_01]: to identify, prevent, and correct common
garden issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please stay tuned for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you for listening to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you learned a whole bunch about
spider mites and fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of
the podcast where I tell you all about
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.

to financially contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a donation for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
dollar or two, if you feel like you
[SPEAKER_01]: learned something, or if I helped you

[SPEAKER_01]: You can contribute as little as one
dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly don't think there's a limit
on how much you can contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I plan to do with your
contributions is I am using those funds to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep my website alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: iRegeneticsColorado.com costs me money to
keep posted every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm using the funds that you guys
contribute to pay for that hosting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also going to use the funds to
replace these microphone covers because

Zoom H6.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will use funds for that from the Patreon
account.

they learn a trick and they grow pot
[SPEAKER_01]: better next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking priceless to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I do this, but it is not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs me money to host my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs me money to buy the things that I
need for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind doing it, but if you'd like
to contribute, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to beg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to offset the cost of the
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs me over $300 for hosting per year
because I put out so much content and the
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes are long and they're high
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use a lot of bandwidth and you guys
listen a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of bandwidth going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it costs me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just asking for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like I'm begging someone to wrap
it up, but patreon.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so frustrating being a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these sexy women don't understand
things we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other day or two, like take you
home, baby, and make sweet love to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you, you won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: She won't let me fuck.

before her
[SPEAKER_00]: ex-boyfriend.

[SPEAKER_00]: You probably can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was easy for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he made it hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she, she won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, give it to me, baby.
