[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of great emails here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: These emails do come from the grow help
tab on my website That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics comm is my main website on
the top of that website There is a row of
[SPEAKER_00]: tabs one of those tabs does say grow help
or grow questions If you click on that tab
[SPEAKER_00]: We do give you the opportunity to send me
your grow question if you send me a
[SPEAKER_00]: question and I read that Question here on
the podcast you will receive a coupon code
[SPEAKER_00]: for a free pack of seeds at I read direct
calm Today's first question came from
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who wants to be called Vista del
Loco big shout out to my buddy Vista del
[SPEAKER_00]: Loco Thank you for the great question Make
sure you check your inbox because you do
[SPEAKER_00]: have a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds at I read direct calm The question
[SPEAKER_00]: from my new friend goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says yo Rasta Jeff I've got a breeder
and etiquette question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question And a great way
to kick off a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate this It says I want to
grow my own strain for myself and I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to give it to my friends and family I
would like to say this is a strain that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made I understand that that's kind of how
I got started There was a lot of pride in
[SPEAKER_00]: making my first strain and I made the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected a male I selected a female I
put them together they made seeds I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a long time for those seeds to be
ready It felt like forever then they were
[SPEAKER_00]: ready then the best part was growing those
and then when my friend We're smoking it
[SPEAKER_00]: to like bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, I bred that I made
that nobody else ever will have that
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is my shit I completely
understand the pride the enthusiasm and
[SPEAKER_00]: the excitement behind this idea and I
fully support it and I want you to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give you some guidance here It
says do I just take a male from raw
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and a female from ivory genetics
and voila I made my own strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Kind of yes, and I actually I recommend
those two breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are raw and myself they are Our
stuff works well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have bred our strains together other
people in the group in the community have
[SPEAKER_00]: bred our strains And it does work very
well And I like the idea that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with two different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to get started You're
putting two totally different flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: palettes to wide open projects together
putting that together to make your own
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff That is a great start But voila that
I make my own strain then he follows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says is it piggybacking off of others?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I start without ripping someone
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: For lack of better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time So I understand what
you're heading for and I appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: forethought the sight the courtesy the
etiquette involved in this question so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you just want to make these seeds for
yourself if you don't ever plan to Sell
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds if you don't want to go to
market if you don't want to be a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: producer a retail seller You can just take
plant a and plant B throw them together
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds and enjoy that is fine That is
how it all starts a lot of breeders are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little pissy a little whiny
They act like little bitches to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with you when you breed with their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't find that to be reasonable They
bred with other people's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not invent I did not we did not
invent cannabis None of us breeders on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market today and the pastor in the future
invented this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all Stewards of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all here to represent this plant in
the best way that we can None of us
[SPEAKER_00]: invented it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to breed with my seeds
raw genetic seeds any other breeder out
[SPEAKER_00]: there you are welcome And allowed to breed
with their seeds especially if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make something for yourself For
the basement for your grow to smoke with
[SPEAKER_00]: the homies to say I did this I'm proud Now
if you want to go a little bit further if
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever plan on selling these seeds There
is a little more etiquette involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: here at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a male and a female and this
is just This is also this used to be and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if James Bean still is if
this is his requirement But James Bean is
[SPEAKER_00]: the founder of seeds here now And if a
breeder approaches him and he did what you
[SPEAKER_00]: said just took raw and ivory and threw
them together and made a seed James Bean
[SPEAKER_00]: would probably tell you I don't want to
bend those seeds do a little bit more work
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here is what probably possibly
kind of should be done just with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of etiquette This is in my opinion a
step that you should possibly do just to
[SPEAKER_00]: give yourself some credit some validity in
this breeding project Take your plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: implant be like you plan to do Grow them
out find a male or a female that you
[SPEAKER_00]: Really love but I recommend to find a male
to start with and use that male to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate other plants that you really
enjoy So create your own male and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: that male to do some work with and then
you've made You've done some work with my
[SPEAKER_00]: gear and with Brad from raw you've taken
our stuff and made something which is cool
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our work put together you did that
but then find a male out of that and put
[SPEAKER_00]: that to some other shit Maybe one of my
other strains one of Brad's other strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and then even do one of somebody else's
other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul pick a a brother's grim strain
and pick a jinx proof strain and breed
[SPEAKER_00]: your creation to four or five other
breeder stuff just to branch it out a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and put some work behind it
don't just take the the blue paint from
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherwin Williams and smear it on canvas
and say I paint it take that blue paint
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it with some green paint and then
smear that shit on canvas then you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: did something if you take that blue and
green and mix it together and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: paint a stripe and put a red stripe next
to it now you're making some art of your
[SPEAKER_00]: own that's the best way that I think I can
kind of explain that now there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of breeders out there that are going to
throw a fit a lot of breeders will get
[SPEAKER_00]: upset if you breed with their gear and put
their seeds to market some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders I may reach out to them if you
want to I'm not going to even list who
[SPEAKER_00]: they are let's talk about the the Jack the
Ripper that I bred with I breed with a
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper male that Jack the Ripper
is sub cools male that is not I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: make that but I use that male in my
breeding project how do I feel ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: about that how do I feel okay selling
those seeds first of all rest in peace sub
[SPEAKER_00]: cool sub cool passed away he's not using
it anymore he's not going to sell those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds he's not losing anything off of me
recreating or keeping that plant alive sub
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and I had a lot of great
conversations he taught me a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: things about the plant about the industry
about life he taught me a lot of what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do also you guys know very well sub cool
taught me a lot of what not to do he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: good example for this industry there was
no map or no roadmap of how to do these
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and sub cool kind of showed me
how to do it in his own way he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: teach me the business I learned it by
watching but sub cool was a big influence
[SPEAKER_00]: to me let me get myself back on track but
sub cool was my friend sub cool was my
[SPEAKER_00]: mentor sub cool taught me a lot of things
sub cool taught me what to do and what not
[SPEAKER_00]: to do in this industry so when sub cool
passed I wanted to honor sub cool and I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt that jack the ripper should be
continued it's something that it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing strain it need to keep it need to
be out in the world still it didn't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to disappear just because sub was gone and
it was a way for me to honor my friend sub
[SPEAKER_00]: cool take his jack the ripper plant use
the mail make another generation of jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the rippers and put that to my stuff so
that sub cool and I could collab so I used
[SPEAKER_00]: that jack the ripper I used that mail to
make further jack the ripper generations
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I also used that jack the ripper
mail to out cross to my stuff to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: collabs with sub cool after he passed to
show love to sub cool now something I did
[SPEAKER_00]: out of respect out of etiquette that I
just felt was right to the industry to the
[SPEAKER_00]: business to my relationship to the plant
to my relationship to sub cool I reached
[SPEAKER_00]: out to sub cools they were divorced when
he passed away so I'm not sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: technical word there I'm gonna say widow I
reached out to sub cools widow and
[SPEAKER_00]: business partner miss Jill and I said hey
Jill subs gone I want to breed with jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the ripper may I have your blessing to do
so so I reached out to the person that was
[SPEAKER_00]: closest to this plant and said hey I know
this is part of your company can I breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with this and Joe politely said hey subs
gone I don't want jack the ripper that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fair game do what you would like to do
thank you for reaching out so big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Jill for giving me the blessing to
breed with jack the ripper now where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: headed with this is there are a few
breeders out there that are publicly pissy
[SPEAKER_00]: about people breeding with their work they
talk about it on the internet they talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it online if you choose to breed
with some of their work maybe reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: and say hey whoever breeder I plan on
breeding your plant to this plant how what
[SPEAKER_00]: is your protocol what is your etiquette
they could be a total dick about it they
[SPEAKER_00]: could be cool about it if you're gonna
sell those seeds they may have a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with it but like I said before they don't
own cannabis bro they did not invent
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis ask them where they got the
plants and seeds that they started their
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding company with they used to some we
all every one of us I don't care how far
[SPEAKER_00]: back we go every one of us breeders that
is selling seeds is using somebody else's
[SPEAKER_00]: plants somewhere on the line none of us
invented cannabis plants we didn't fart a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant out of the sky we didn't manifest
one we didn't AI generate one we didn't 3d
[SPEAKER_00]: print one we used a plant that somebody
else bred somewhere along the line so to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that you can't work with somebody
else's gear and sell seeds is hypocritical
[SPEAKER_00]: in my mind and also I love the healing
aspect the community the the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant more than I care about intellectual
property rights there are some things I do
[SPEAKER_00]: care about don't steal my strain names
don't steal my artwork don't be a dick
[SPEAKER_00]: like that but cannabis seeds get them out
there grow them get those everywhere breed
[SPEAKER_00]: them make more get everybody growing get
everybody growing the best gun to that
[SPEAKER_00]: they possibly can that's the whole point
of this podcast overgrow the government
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the best we can get everybody on top
of the cannabis plants all right I am
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking super rambly I wish I remember
what I smoked before this podcast because
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell you and you could get some
too and you could feel as good as I do my
[SPEAKER_00]: dude vista this was a great question but
like I said if you take plant a plant B
[SPEAKER_00]: breed them together you've made your own
project if you're satisfied with that also
[SPEAKER_00]: make a predictive goal before you do this
write down a goal and say I want these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I hope these plants do this then
you know if you hit your goal if you hit
[SPEAKER_00]: your goal you got something to brag about
that is your first cross you can claim it
[SPEAKER_00]: I would then find a male out of that maybe
even find a female enough to it but the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing I would do find a boy and then
hit some other girls and that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project right there that you can
talk about that is your true work so yes
[SPEAKER_00]: the first run counts the second one is
when you can actually do something with
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds if you choose to my dude thank
you for the great question you got me
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling quite well make sure you check
your inbox because you've got a coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: code for a free pack of seeds at i
redirect dot com all right let's keep this
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum going I've got another great
question here in front of me this one also
[SPEAKER_00]: came from that grow help tab on i redirect
dot com this one came from my buddy Mike D
[SPEAKER_00]: shot up to Mike D make sure you check your
inbox because once again you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at i
redirect dot com the question from my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Mike D goes a little bit like this
it says
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for all you've taught me and I
appreciate you this is a great question
[SPEAKER_00]: let me recap really quickly what I'm
talking about then I'll explain my reply
[SPEAKER_00]: my response my answer here now let me
recap a little bit about this question in
[SPEAKER_00]: case you're new to the podcast for a while
now I have been recommending a new light
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule toward the end of the flowering
cycle when most people would begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush I don't know if you flush or not
that's a whole another topic a whole other
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast but when most people would begin
to flush that last 10 to 14 day period of
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowering period I recommend changing
the light cycle we should be on probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 12 cycle for flowering what I recommend
is changing that light cycle to 18 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: on and 6 hours off now most people when
they hear this the first time they think I
[SPEAKER_00]: am completely crazy I've been called a lot
of prime words because of this idea but
[SPEAKER_00]: the only people that think this is a bad
idea are the people who have not tried it
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who have done this have all
reported great results with the 18 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: on and 6 hours off at the end of the
flowering cycle my theory here my theory
[SPEAKER_00]: is that light is the number one source of
energy for our plants at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle why wouldn't we give our
plants as much light as we possibly can to
[SPEAKER_00]: beef them up when they get more light they
can photosynthesize more they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get bigger they're going to get beefier
and they're going to finish a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly because there's just more
process happening so a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say won't that cause your plants
to revege no because we're going to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them down way before they've even got that
opportunity revege takes closer to three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to even start we're gonna cut these
down 10 to 14 days in this process you
[SPEAKER_00]: have no fear no concern of a revege
process so quick recap at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower the last 10 to 14 days I recommend
putting your light cycle back on to 18
[SPEAKER_00]: hours on and 6 hours off and then pay
attention to those trichomes because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to ripen up more quickly
than you are familiar with and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: can harvest a little bit earlier and you
will have beefier more dense buds possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: even more weight at the end of harvest so
this listener wants to try the 18 six
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle but they've got a question about the
DLI they said what DLI should I shoot for
[SPEAKER_00]: because everything else I read was about a
shorter light cycle yes there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: educators out there other breeders other
growers they do talk about a shorter light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle that will work you will see results
but I believe if you try what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: preaching one time compare that to those
other light cycles I think you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with this 18 six now the question is
what DLI should I shoot for honestly here
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really simple answer I don't have a
DLI number for you in any way shape or
[SPEAKER_00]: form whatever the DLI is in your room now
with those lights on at 1212 just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: change the timer that's all you got to do
a lot of people ask me questions about
[SPEAKER_00]: this adjustment they want to know do I
increase the lights do I turn down the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights do I change the spectrum do I move
the lights no the only thing I can
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend the only thing I do I change the
timer I don't move the lights I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: change the spectrum I don't even check the
DLI if I'm on 1212 I had six hours that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all I do and that's what I would recommend
for you as well I understand that we all
[SPEAKER_00]: like a metric I understand that we like
some sort of reading some sort of data
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of info we could write down but
in this scenario I've never bothered to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that because that wasn't part of my
experiment part of my idea it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter to me because I knew that whatever
I was getting I want six hours more that
[SPEAKER_00]: was just the thought process in there I
understand that you want data metrics
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical points that we can write down
but that's not where I was headed with
[SPEAKER_00]: this I've been growing cannabis really
good cannabis way before we had all this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology way before I had access to
before I even knew what DLI and VPD and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that shit was I was doing it
intuitively I was watching the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how the plants respond to light
stress abuse whatever and that's how I
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to manipulate the plant is by
seeing what has happened my ph pin is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my favorite tools but beyond that I
don't need a lot of oh and probably my my
[SPEAKER_00]: high thermometer I need to know how hot
and cold it is in the room and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: via the humidity is in there so I've got a
VPD monitor now that tells me all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: but back in the day I didn't need any of
that stuff I look at the plants the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me almost everything I need to know
about that grow room I look at the timer
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the timer is set right make sure
the VPD is in line and then look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants if the plants are doing one thing
it means this if the plants are doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing it means this have you ever
just reached out and touched your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if they're hot or cold remember
when you're little your mom would touch
[SPEAKER_00]: your cheek and say you're cold you need a
jacket you do the same thing to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants if you think they're getting cold
to reach out and touch them if they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: cold they're probably cold crank up the
heat in the room add more light do
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that my point is I don't
have a perfect DLI number for you because
[SPEAKER_00]: I never that wasn't part of my experiment
part of my project here I noticed when I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave them more light they performed better
and finished earlier and the way I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: them more is whatever I was giving them
six hours more so I know you wish that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had a data point I wish I did too but plus
six hours is my algebra for you here my
[SPEAKER_00]: dude Mike D you got me rambling pretty
good whatever I've been smoking has me
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling pretty good so thanks for the

[SPEAKER_00]: free seeds all right this is a great
question it says yo Rasta Jeff if a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you are making seeds with gets powdery
mildew are those seeds guaranteed to have
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew inside of them I can't wait
till the next drop thanks for your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding this is a very good question I
like this there are two different thought
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that my brain head down when we
talk about this question so let me try to
[SPEAKER_00]: unwrap both of them slowly and we'll
figure this out together so what this
[SPEAKER_00]: person is asking if you've got a plant and
you've pollinated it and there are seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that plant if this plant gets
attacked by powdery mildew will those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds have powdery mildew inside of them
the answer to that is quickly no powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew does not work like that the babies
will not be born with powdery mildew that
[SPEAKER_00]: does not work that way there could however
be powdery mildew on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed which is a completely different story
it is not in the seed it is on the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it can be removed and
sanitized it's two totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: things so it may be on the outside the
powdery mildew may be on the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed but it is not within that seed
so if you clean the outside it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitized it can be removed that is very
easy to do now what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: here is kind of a question about
epigenetics this may be the first time I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up epigenetics here on this
podcast let me explain it very simply I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't understand epigenetics on a
scientific level I understand it on a very
[SPEAKER_00]: rudimentary level the way that I can
explain it in a way that I think we will
[SPEAKER_00]: all understand is if a living organism
faces a problem adversary the same sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna we'll use we'll jump right to
the point if a cannabis plant over several
[SPEAKER_00]: generations if a cannabis plant is
attacked with powdery mildew eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenetics will create an evolutionary
cure for that problem and now this is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I've got two different schools of
thought because part of me would say well
[SPEAKER_00]: find plants that aren't susceptible to
powdery mildew and breed with those but
[SPEAKER_00]: also this is how you generate plants that
are not susceptible to powdery mildew so
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with those two different schools of
thought here follow along this may be an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental issue in any plant we put in
this region is going to get powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: so if we add that if you had a grow room
that every time you put plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: they get powdery mildew something I may
think of doing this is just a wild idea
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's breed in that room and let's
breed in that room for ten generations and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the tenth generation that plant will
realize powdery mildew is not going away
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do something about it
eventually those seeds will start to build
[SPEAKER_00]: a defense and an immunity a resistance to
powdery mildew and that is how you can
[SPEAKER_00]: breed that in there is by doing it
multiple times putting a plant so we take
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant put it in the room and get powdery
mildew we take seeds out grow those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: put plants in that room again the one that
got the least amount of powdery mildew in
[SPEAKER_00]: that same condition select that one breed
to that plant pollinate that plant pull
[SPEAKER_00]: the progeny from those the plant out of
that generation that gets the least amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdery mildew breed to that again but
keep that room fucked up so we get powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew in there every time and keep
pulling out the one with the least amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdery mildew generation after
generation and I think that epigenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary time over time over
generations will teach this plant powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew is gonna fucking happen you got to
be ready for it and eventually we will
[SPEAKER_00]: breed plants that don't get powdery mildew
that is one school of thought my other
[SPEAKER_00]: school of thought is why don't we breed
plants why are you putting shit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room that gets powdery mildew but that is
how you do it so I would also say if a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant gets powdery mildew in your room
don't breed to it but we've got this this
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber of death here that we've set up so
that is one way to kind of breed out
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew or breed in powdery mildew
resistance to plants over generations keep
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them powdery mildew and select the
best one put it in there select the best
[SPEAKER_00]: one put it in there but also while you're
doing this my my side B thought over here
[SPEAKER_00]: says take that same plant and put it in a
normal environment and see if it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew in there see if it's just
if it's gonna get it in normal
[SPEAKER_00]: environments or if it only gets it from
this heavy room test it in normal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and stressful conditions would
be my thought process to that that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder brain wanting to be what is it
called redundant on seeing how healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are how resistant they are so
um no the answer is no there will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew inside of your seed but
there could be on the outside of the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why many people use a light
dilution a light solution of diluted
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide when they're germinating
seeds I don't do that I don't recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that I feel that that wipes off all of the
living microbes we want right off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I do something a little bit
different I choose to put microbes I
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce my own microbes into that soil
into that seed life before it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to get attacked of course I do use
recharge is what I use I had a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of recharge to that germination water or
that soil and what that recharge was will
[SPEAKER_00]: do it's already colonizing beneficial
bacteria so there's no room for the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative bacteria to get in no problems
get in there it can get in there my
[SPEAKER_00]: security guards if you will big shout out
to Scotty real iosha Scotty real a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out for the recharge yeah use some
recharge to prevent that sort of that
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew problem but there will not
be on the inside of the seed the zygote
[SPEAKER_00]: will not contain powdery mildew but quite
the opposite if you breed several
[SPEAKER_00]: generations like I was talking about you
can breed powdery mildew resistance into
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant so my dude Vermont Redeye thank
you for the great question very unique
[SPEAKER_00]: idea very unique question we haven't heard
something like this and I got to sound
[SPEAKER_00]: smart by talking a little bit about
epigenetics all right ladies and gentlemen
[SPEAKER_00]: boys girls pimps hoes friends foes smokers
growers clone cutters Paul and Chuckers
[SPEAKER_00]: skateboarders and fruit booters I want to
thank each and every one of you for

[SPEAKER_00]: that grow help tab send me your questions
if I read the question here free seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: you my dude everything else you could
possibly need is on that website
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics.com there's a link to my
discord server a link to the patreon a
[SPEAKER_00]: link to get the seeds at ire direct
there's a link to get merchandise you can
[SPEAKER_00]: grab the hats grinders rolling trays a lot
of good stuff still available in the merch
[SPEAKER_00]: store once again everything is available
at iregenetics.com all right I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hear my voice getting dry and burning
out that is my cue to wrap up the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of here it's time to go get some
hydration and some dabs I'll be back in a
[SPEAKER_00]: week with fresh new content I want to give
a big shout out to my buddy your mailman
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and until next time take a fat dab
and give your mom a hug for me rasta jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: you bad mother... time to take another dab
grab your piece and a nougat by the bag
