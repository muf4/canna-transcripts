[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start this episode off by
talking about some fun events that I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to have this week just recently allegedly
possibly maybe I was invited to attend a
[SPEAKER_00]: green dot labs tasting event and party was
mainly a budtender educational event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work for a facility but Green Dot
knows who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that I enjoy and promote their
products quite heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did invite me to come to their
party and enjoy their tasting and
[SPEAKER_00]: educational event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite a it was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite a terpy evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do so say say so myself that's harder
to say than it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me scroll to these notes and get
myself on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was I can't even tell you where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a location that had non-alcoholic
beverages provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provided pizza and then most
importantly they provided plenty of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a nice dab bar set up a little
educational pamphlets everywhere so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can read and learn about the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have a dab multiple dab
stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set up and at those stations some had
rosin and some had batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have a little placard or a
little sign to let you know what strains
[SPEAKER_00]: were at that table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be like it would be like rosin or
would say live batter and then it would
[SPEAKER_00]: say like fortissimo or rainbow belts or
whatever strains were at that table.
[SPEAKER_00]: One table had batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One had rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another table had batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another had rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never had to wait in too long of a
line to get a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just went if you took a dab and
then went walked around for a minute and
[SPEAKER_00]: got in line you'd get another dab in
plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was well organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did of course have to get an invite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you had to get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you had to show your ticket and ID to
even enter the building which I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a private party but it was such a
good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each booth I think was offering three
different varieties of Green Dot products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try a lot of great stuff that
I've never had before and then I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: try things that I have had before in a
different setting off of a different
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking device off of a different rig
perhaps through a puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really good smoking
concentrates I'm familiar with in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different environment with different
people getting a different experience from
[SPEAKER_00]: the same flavors but then also being
exposed to brand new things that are up
[SPEAKER_00]: and coming from Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some I'm not even sure I can tell you
about so far but I tried a lot of batters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a lot of rosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my favorite of the evening was the
rainbow belts V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was freaking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit it kind of hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy was kind of kind of confused why I
like to go so hot but I like I'm hot and
[SPEAKER_00]: hurty bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the rainbow belts V2 live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure it was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't rosin it was batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had all of the right turps all of the
right flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had that diesel thing to it at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you exhale it's like it leaves a
thing on your tongue but then it left
[SPEAKER_00]: berries in my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really beautiful really good flavors from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rainbow belts V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good social experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go out to bars and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I'm really at a show or at
a club or at a bar or anything is for a
[SPEAKER_00]: show a comedy show or some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be invited to something social where
there was not alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not an alcohol based event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could actually go smoke and enjoy
smoking concentrates in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking flour in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I smoke too much flour in public
or too much flour at all my throat gets
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and scratchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to stick with the dabs at public
smoking and education events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bar was basically closed as a bar and
it was just turned into a hangout
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no alcohol being served.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all non alcoholic cocktails plenty
of water hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The restrooms were easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was free pizza available even
vegetarian friendly pizza for the veggie
[SPEAKER_00]: heads over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I did notice is that I made a
joke about the puff co is the new bud
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody had a beer in that event because it
was an alcohol free establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody was carrying a puff co and I
used to frequent alcohol drinking bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go to the bar all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys and everybody's got the way that
they hold their beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys hold the beer up here by their
chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys do the arm curl in and kind of
tuck it real close to their chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys just hold it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys hold it down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have our place where we hold our
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny noticing everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't hold my beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold my puff co.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny noticing how everybody just
where your puff co was placed in your
[SPEAKER_00]: holding position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was really entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the puff co peak or the puff co
guardian or maybe even the proxy is the
[SPEAKER_00]: new bud light at hangout establishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough rambling about the green dot
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was really great to go smoke
concentrates and socialize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and talked to a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to people I knew they knew people
standing there that I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a bunch of friends made some
Instagram friends got some followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm following new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some new bros to kick it take dabs
with and I got to smoke and learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: some great green dot concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to walk around with the puff co and
just rip that at will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could walk up to a booth and they say
what do you want to try and say I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the sex on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd pass you the sex on the beach
container and a dabber and he just put
[SPEAKER_00]: some in your puff co and then rip it as it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really generous and really
friendly about it was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Casey from green dot
labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey is the one that invited me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet everybody from green dot all
the all the people that were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to try to list all
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take me forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you guys next
time and multiple people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one question there was what is
your favorite green dot concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say it again it is garlic banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I went to my local dispensary and I
did pick up a four gram jar of the garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: banger because I cannot get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn this down just a touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice it peeking out a little bit up
there on the on the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope it sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to cut myself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to fix that since I notice
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I'm going to make a quick disclaimer
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green dot does not pay me for any of this
advertising promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply think it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the right price point for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me high as giraffe pussy and eagle
dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're all after right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works well for my medical and
recreational needs and it fits my budget
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's always fucking quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green dot black label is one of my
favorite products and to get even closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green dot black label garlic banger
for tizzy mo thunder dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point break.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that shit is super delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get live batter and full
spectrum extract and mix them together and
[SPEAKER_00]: take big dabs of that nastiness delicious
nastiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way but they don't pay me for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go buy that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they do kindly invite me to
events like this to show love for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again big up to green dot labs big up
to my friend Casey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey look forward to seeing you again
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else a green dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to seeing you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting one question quite often
it is time to address this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have messaged on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've sent me private messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say hey bro what happened to the
clone episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: A while back there was a great cloning
episode of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube took that bad dog down.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube thinks that me showing you how to
cut clones and propagate plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found that to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took down the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave my channel a strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a community guidelines
strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get too many of those within a
certain time they will shut down the
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took down that one and they also
took down the popping and twisting and
[SPEAKER_00]: they took down a couple other videos all
in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a big swoop a big sweep if you
want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just felt like somebody was bored over at
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to find something to do to
look busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went took down a couple of videos
of mine just to fucking have what is it a
[SPEAKER_00]: quota some credit for the day look like
they did something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah apparently creating smaller
plants from larger plants is harmful and
[SPEAKER_00]: or dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dangerous and harmful activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that YouTube took that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are looking for specific
videos of the podcast I don't take them
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work hard to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them all up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a it's kind of a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it a fucking a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the thing when you bury it in a
time capsule it's a time capsule and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also historical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a historical document.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is even if I take down
episodes the things I said the opinions I
[SPEAKER_00]: had don't disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I felt at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take them down because I work
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that to be up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a timeline a time capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm documenting the evolution of my
experience in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I was at the right place at
the right time to kind of have a voice in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm documenting my experience and I
don't want to edit delete alter or any of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some people that aren't even in
the crew anymore some people that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on old episodes of the podcast
and people say wouldn't you take that
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said no bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took down that episode it doesn't
change the fact that that person came here
[SPEAKER_00]: and did that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were business partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point we're still the world still
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just I can't delete an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point you guys I try not to change
the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to change the archive if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe in preserving that archive
kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my roles in cannabis is to
keep that that archive that history true
[SPEAKER_00]: and accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like when people mix up stories
and shit and tell miss myths and lies and
[SPEAKER_00]: misconceptions of cannabis and the history
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I try not to delete shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those episodes are gone because
YouTube I don't take them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the short version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me respond to some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many haters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I talk about running my light
schedule on 18 6 at the end of flower I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about this enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have to recap really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last 10 maybe 14 days of flower I put
my lights back on 18 hours on and 16 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my belief that light is the number
one source of energy for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll finish a little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a little more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you out there hear me say this
and you are really quick to get up on your
[SPEAKER_00]: keyboard and just start telling me I'm an
idiot that I'm stupid that I'm ruining
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that I've never grown a plant in my
life that I don't know what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: which I don't talk about things on the
podcast unless I've done it plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to steer people wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of haters so many haters are
sending me documents are sending me charts
[SPEAKER_00]: are sending me graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop educate me inform me update me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also guess what you guys I got a lot
of supporters people that are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it that are sending me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it graphs charts reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they're sending me pictures of
their plants that look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sending me reports saying my buds
were more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more product and more satisfied than
I ever was because I did the little trick
[SPEAKER_00]: that you told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only people who are not doing it
that are unhappy with my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that have tried it have all
said hey that works bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't work for you when you
try it then guess what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all shit works for everybody but so
far nobody has complained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only people saying it doesn't work
and the only people telling me that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy are the people that haven't tried
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people doing it they seem to be liking
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter to me what light
schedule you run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't as long as you're happy
with the way that the plants come out it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't bother you so much that I'm
doing something differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be working for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it try it then bash me if you try it
and fucking hate it then send me some hate
[SPEAKER_00]: mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't don't just send me hate mail
because you think it is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my one of my points here is don't
don't be afraid to try new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call me crazy if you want to but
don't be afraid to try some new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things about growing
cannabis is that there's no one way of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all doing this differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to do this kind of before we
had a lot of resources on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing this in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to we had to be real quiet real
careful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was learning how to do this way back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it way differently than the
guy down the street doing it than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other guy doing it than all the other guys
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all doing it our own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use different gear
different schedules different ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely different genetics different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what we're all going to make
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to make really delicious
buds in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one way to grow a ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have quality buds that aren't
contaminated by some mold or pests just
[SPEAKER_00]: decide at the end that you're cool with
smoking that the people in your circle
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's your patients your friends
maybe it's your clientele maybe it's your
[SPEAKER_00]: family whoever is smoking it if they're
happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have the same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's all be on the same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I accidentally got involved in a
debate about drying and curing temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody thinks a friend of mine bro
you're going to hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We disagree and guess what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still love you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fucking sit next to you and smoke a
bottle with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even care that we disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares that we disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do shit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is I'm involved in a conversation
about drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ongoing argument between multiple
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make it an argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying here's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I'm not saying I don't care what
you do but it doesn't matter to me what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in other people's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you do really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of my business what you're doing
in there unless you ask for my help or you
[SPEAKER_00]: need some guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't even be peeking in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have an opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend that dries and cures
differently than me bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think Pimpin dry and cure
differently than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your weed comes out good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's different as long as
it's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main guideline the things I do care
about is is there mold in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a pesticide contamination in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if there's mold pesticides or if
it's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got ethics if it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how it's dried and cured if
it longs as long as it comes out trimmed
[SPEAKER_00]: dried cured and dang it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point here is let's learn together.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend has a completely different idea
of how to dry and cure weed than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he grows great weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both grow top quality weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would smoke his weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would smoke my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would argue for a minute about drying
carrying guess what I'll high five him
[SPEAKER_00]: give him a hug pack him up a fat bong rip
pass him a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd do the same for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I drink beer I'm sure we'd crack open a
beer together and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the community that was in
that conversation we know who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has anything to if we're doing
things different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may inspire me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may educate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may inspire spark me to do things
differently and learn some different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on the same team here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got the same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you go jumping down someone's
throat because they grow weed differently
[SPEAKER_00]: than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe you just realize we're on the
same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not fight about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's teach each other also be open to
learn something be open to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a brief distraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen keep the conversation
going in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the emails coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the grow help tab on the Web site is
now corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did notice that the emails from the grow
help tab were not being forwarded to my
[SPEAKER_00]: email inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have asked a grow question on the
grow help tab recently and I have not
[SPEAKER_00]: responded to you or answered that question
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do resend that question once again
on the updated grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that at I read genetics dot
com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tab on the top that says grow
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply click on there that will give you
the grow help tab ask you a few questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that will send your message directly to my
inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will now before it was not something got
broken in the chain there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it will send that to my inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Web guy for fixing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please do send those messages to the
grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get your grow help questions here
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me to build listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common question I've been getting
lately involving that eighteen six light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle is do I change the light intensity
when I switch my lights from twelve twelve
[SPEAKER_00]: to eighteen six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I change the intensity of the bulbs at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been spending the entire flowering
cycle ramping up from one point in my
[SPEAKER_00]: light game all the way up to the maximum
light of my lights or the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ride for a couple of weeks at full
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put them back on eighteen six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to reduce the intensity in my
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your room may need reduction if you've got
LEDs and you've gone all the way up and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're close to cooking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaves pay attention
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the DLI the daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to look a little bit
confused and frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do not dial back the intensity if
the leaves start looking crispy or burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to dial it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually start when I go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My LEDs are usually around 50 to 60
percent of their power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I slowly increase them and by week
seven eight or nine I'm generally up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent power.
[SPEAKER_00]: My LEDs don't have a real clear percentage
dial on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a you put a screwdriver and
turn a screw and it turns all the way this
[SPEAKER_00]: way is approximately 50 percent all the
way this way is 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start here when they go into flower and
I slowly crank them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I nudge them just a little bit every week
just a little bit of a percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you precisely how much it is
honestly but I know I start at 50 then I
[SPEAKER_00]: do end up at 100 percent and I do not turn
that intensity down once I get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I'm using a high pressure sodium
lamp in this room which sometimes I do
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the winter it gets really cold
and the LED doesn't keep the room warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just use a high pressure sodium bulb
to keep the room warm and spread some
[SPEAKER_00]: light around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using the high pressure sodium I
simply lower that light or raise that
[SPEAKER_00]: light to adjust the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it just stays in the one
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't move it after I've done the change
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to keep them kind of far from
the canopy still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plants have grown up real tall
and flowered into the lighting then you
[SPEAKER_00]: may need to do some height adjustments or
possibly some intensity adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan ahead for that sort of stuff so
I don't have to cut back intensity at all
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to that 18 six flowering
cycle toward the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my space in my grow in my
application I do not reduce the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not raise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not lower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply plan ahead and know what to
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I allow that extra space between the bulbs
and between my lights and I slowly ramp it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys you should be in my opinion from
what I've learned with LED lighting is we
[SPEAKER_00]: should not be just putting the plants
under there at full intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a good strong quality light
if you've got a low intensity low output
[SPEAKER_00]: LED light that's not putting out a whole
bunch of spectrum a whole bunch of light
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you can crank that bitch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the plants are little they don't
need all that LED lighting from what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the plant or the light at the right
height dial it down low and as the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grows slowly increase that save some
boosting for when it goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add some lumens add some
intensity when it does grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into flower so slowly increase them
from veg as they grow as they grow into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower increase it a little more so that
around week seven eight or nine then you
[SPEAKER_00]: finally reach your full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people go at week six some go later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you in your life but it's
easier if you ramp it up just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the plants do perform a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about one more thing
before we start wrapping up this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: another question that I do get quite
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy one to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff what are table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy seeds from I redirect or if
you've gotten seeds from me in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a good chance that you've received
table seeds as a freebie as a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Table seeds are simply table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make packages I will get my my
amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll have an amount of I'm just
going to say random strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's Jack Tripper seeds that I'm
packaging up today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get my packaging supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get my light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get my little setup and I'll package
up a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through the strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through the moon tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through the whatever other strain
that I set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll package up however many packages I'm
aiming to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll clean up and then I notice that
sometimes maybe over here under the iPad
[SPEAKER_00]: stand there's a couple of seeds and over
here by the recording device there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of seeds that just rolled away or
there's a seed over here by my phone that
[SPEAKER_00]: just got away and I'm not sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sell you those seeds in a package
because I can't guarantee which batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have been anything that I
worked on today or maybe something from a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days ago that I didn't even see
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't clean up well enough and I found
seeds that are just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those table seeds are random seeds from
my inventory that could be anything from
[SPEAKER_00]: my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be unreleased beans that I was
counting for myself and one got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been something I was sharing
with a friend and one rolled off to the
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: My table seeds could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do like to post the table seeds to the
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are on the discord find the table
seed section post the pictures in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of fun guessing and
speculating what they could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly they could be anything from
my vault old stuff new stuff future stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be shit that's not even thought
of or released that you know of yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be stuff I'm keeping secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I was breaking off seeds to send to
one of my favorite friends who's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I was given Dave's not here some
seeds and I just accidentally spilled a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple who knows what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could be anything from the I read
genetics lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get table seeds I encourage you to
grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't charge anything for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ask anything for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just come in your box randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get those grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a winner or a gem send me some
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what it smells like how it
grew how it acted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just for fun we can try to identify
your table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what table seeds are.
