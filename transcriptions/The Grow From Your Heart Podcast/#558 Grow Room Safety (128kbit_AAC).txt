[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of reba jam live
batter from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of jelly 13 and I 95 on
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as tangerine and
sour fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crack open the jar, I am greeted by
a sweet tangerine aroma, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by a funky sour fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take dabs of it, I definitely taste
that sour fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I dab it nice and cool, the orange
flavor and aroma comes in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go too hot, it is definitely sour and
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says the
product does contain 64.08% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at green dot
labs for the delicious reba jam live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read an
email about grow room safety.

[SPEAKER_00]: This is the portion of the show where I
start reading listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to focus on grow room
safety that was brought to my attention by
[SPEAKER_00]: a listener named Brandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump right into their email
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Rasta Jeff, feel free to use my
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that info right at the start
of the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I've been listening to
your podcast since last fall when a dude
[SPEAKER_00]: at my local grow shop gave me your podcast
info and the DGC info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so thankful to him for that because
your podcast has helped me learn so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you to that guy at the grow
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad he introduced you to the grow
from your heart podcast and the dude grow
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys aren't already watching the
dude grow show, I highly encourage you to
[SPEAKER_00]: check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching me on YouTube,
if you're listening on Apple podcast or
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotify, the dude grows show is available
wherever you're watching or listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to the service, go to the search
bar, type in dude grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends in the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep going cause that Reba Jam
got me chattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you taught me not only about
cannabis, but about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the message gets
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says last night after putting our two
kids to bed, my wife came downstairs and
[SPEAKER_00]: found water running all the way down into
our living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just bought this house last year and we
have done a lot of work on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: including new laminate flooring,
which was water resistant, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was completely horrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was horrified to come downstairs and see
water everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gotta be a scary site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I ran to our basement to grab the
shop vac and there were waterfalls coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made me feel a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said that my stomach moved,
I got a little drop in my gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: My chest felt tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waterfalls coming from the ceiling is
never a good thing unless you paid extra
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 99% of the time a major fucking
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horrified isn't even a strong enough word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling panic inside right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not even my house or my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says sheer panic took over and I ran to
the grow room to find it completely dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and the flooding water hadn't crept that
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bit of water from another part,
but it was very little, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like this could have been much
worse and I'm really glad it wasn't too
[SPEAKER_00]: bad for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I had just revamped the
grow last month, which included switching
[SPEAKER_00]: out lights, caulking and sealing
everything super tight and we repainted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also very mindful to place all cords
and electronics up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that in a previous episode,
but we'll get there in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electronics are hanging from hooks or
sitting on a tall shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say that the likelihood of doing
that on my own is slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without your knowledge, without your
podcast and without your talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: important safety is in the grow room,
I can't say I would have given the safety
[SPEAKER_00]: much thought if any.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds asinine and kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the cords and shit all over
sometimes, which I've gone around and
[SPEAKER_00]: placed on top of tables and desks and off
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll never have them on the floor again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem like a fucking standup guy and I
hope to get to meet you and give you a hug
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope when all this quarantine and
weirdness goes away, that I get to meet a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people and get a lot of hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, sorry for this long ass email,
but I thought you'd enjoy this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crazy that it has inspired a redo of
the grow room safety episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe as hell during this crazy
pandemic attached as a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did watch that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just water falling from this
person's ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of water everywhere in places it
shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wrap it up and it says from
Brandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that has inspired a grow room safety
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason Brandy was smart enough and
aware to keep their electronics up off the
[SPEAKER_00]: floors because I did an episode in the
past, but we are now on a video format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to do a refresher of the
grow room safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about basic safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things we can hurt
ourselves, potentially make ourselves sick
[SPEAKER_00]: with in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always think about personal protective
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go in there, do you have the
right stuff on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wearing the right shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have gloves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're just going in there to look
at the plants, but if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch a plant, if you're going to touch a
bottle, put on some gloves, six millimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: or thicker nitrile gloves are what I
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're doing in your
grow, but possibly you have applied a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sprayed that pesticide,
it didn't just hit the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hit the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hit the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hit the doorknobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hit everywhere in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're going to go in there and
touch shit in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pick up pesticides off the
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get pesticides off the
doorknob.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably pesticides in places you
didn't think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get that on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get a big rash on
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to look like a fucking freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear protective gloves in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about, don't touch
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the gloves on, don't hit
your face with those gloves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your face itches, take the gloves off,
scratch your face, get new gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not contaminate ourselves with
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in a previous episode, we heard about
a listener who gets rashes just from
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in contact with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not give ourselves any rashes from
the plants themselves or the pesticides or
[SPEAKER_00]: any other foliar feeds we may have applied
to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with rubber gloves, I recommend long
sleeves in a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the perfect environment for
wearing long sleeves, but you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that pesticide on your arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about a moment ago,
we had a listener who got a rash just from
[SPEAKER_00]: touching the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wearing long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be something real thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just got like a light, like a light
little linen, just a button down shirt to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on, you still look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look good in there and you're
protecting your arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a hoodie guy, wear a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a long sleeve shirt guy,
wear a long sleeve shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a guy or a gal that doesn't want
to cover up your sleeves, you can run that
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of getting a pesticide on your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run the risk of getting the rash,
but I highly recommend gloves and long
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're wearing pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times I see people wearing
shorts in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's acceptable unless you're
spraying a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are applying something,
be completely covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our arms covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less likely that our legs are going
to brush up against plants, but if they
[SPEAKER_00]: do, I recommend you wear pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also always have good shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us want to be barefoot in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us want to run around and feel
the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your grow, if that's what you
want to do, go for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend shoes for several
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, let's think about
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in an indoor environment and
you have applied a pesticide, where does
[SPEAKER_00]: it all land?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that dripped off the plants,
anything that wasn't caught in the air is
[SPEAKER_00]: on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were barefoot, you were rubbing
your bare feet on that pesticide laden
[SPEAKER_00]: floor unless you have mopped since the
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in there barefoot, I'm imagining
you're not a mopping kind of person as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're barefoot in that dirty grow room
collecting pesticides on the bottoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottoms of your feet are one of the
most absorbent parts of your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get a pesticide toxicity,
just pour it onto the bottoms of your
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll absorb really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to get yourself sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend shoes in there to keep
yourself away from the pesticides that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also anything else you may have spilled,
a nutrient, a nutrient bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nutrient solution, that's on the floor
getting into your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't be good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also not good for your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a major hippie too when I was
younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I wear shoes in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you drop something on your feet?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're out of work for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wear some shoes is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial grow,
you better be wearing closed toed shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show up to my commercial grow in
flip flops or sandals, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Better go to the car and find some good
shoes or go home and get some good ones
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not wearing that shit in my
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourselves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also wear if you're around any sort of
sprays, if you are mixing pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're mixing nutrients, I recommend
some sort of goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds excessive, but your
eyes are the most sensitive organ in your
[SPEAKER_00]: body that are exposed to the outside
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could poke you anywhere on the chest and
the arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be cool, but if I get
right in your eye one time, it fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear something over your eyes when you're
mixing and spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime, if you're going to reach for a
pesticide or a nutrient bottle right
[SPEAKER_00]: before you reach for that, put on gloves
and goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy, especially in a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, if I see you not using the
appropriate personal protective equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: in a commercial grow, you get to take a
little break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to come up to the office and hang
out with me while I write out a report on
[SPEAKER_00]: how you are failing to wear the products
that I have assigned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself safe, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just because it looks cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just because we're nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to be safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who was mixing nutrients
by himself and he got pH down in his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't wearing goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got pH down on his hand and rubbed it
into his eye is what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got it from his skin into his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's got pH down on his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's burning his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's also got it in his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what he had to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: He pulled out his phone and used Siri to
call 911 to call an ambulance to his grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room to come help him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine being in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the cops, the paramedics
showing up at your grow unless it's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I'm talking about has a
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just coming out here trying to be
dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm getting older, but that's not
what this is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because I care about you guys and
you may not have thought about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to give you a reminder and
give you examples of why you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use the equipment I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gloves, long sleeves, good shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shall be self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, your eyes are sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can poke you anywhere else on your body,
but the minute I touch your eyeball,
[SPEAKER_00]: you fucking want to run away and take a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to make sure to talk
about is selecting the appropriate mask or
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator when applying a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I see guys wearing gloves
and long sleeves and they got the goggles
[SPEAKER_00]: on when they're spraying a pesticide,
but they have forgotten to use some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a mask or respirator over their face to
protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're spraying a pesticide,
you're making bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making a mist in the room and then
you're breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just sucking up all that mist,
all those bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are pesticiding yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're applying pesticides to your lungs
if you're not wearing the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend the appropriate
respirator for pesticide applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you are using something like
a paint sprayer to make really small
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a fogger, definitely,
definitely you need a mask or a
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inside of your pesticides,
not on the inside, on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide bottle, there is a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you open that book, it will tell you
what personal protective equipment you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to wear while applying that
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says minimum requirement,
that is the minimum requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do more, but don't do less than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is what is known as the
re-entry interval printed on that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The REI tells you how long you need to
stay out of that grow room without
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment before you
re-enter after applying that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the REI is four hours, you go in
there with your equipment, you spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: you come out, you set a timer for four
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a commercial grow, put a sign on
the door that says, Hey, I sprayed in here
[SPEAKER_00]: at noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go back in here until four o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are signs that are already
pre-made from the department of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, they will give them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will sell them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those signs on your doors to let
people know, don't go in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprayed this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are applying pesticides indoors,
increase the REI by a minimum of two to
[SPEAKER_00]: four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The REI, the re-entry interval was
designed for a greenhouse or an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not think we were going to apply
these pesticides indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the sun breaking down the
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have as much air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as open and free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are trapped in that stagnant box of a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please allow an extra two to four hours
for a re-entry interval after a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: in a grow room indoors, not just a small,
in a big room indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that pesticide break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that cloud of fog spray go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put yourself in danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself that extra re-entry
interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, write down every pesticide
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a commercial grow,
you are required to keep a pesticide log.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a personal grow,
I recommend keeping a pesticide log.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down every pesticide you sprayed,
the date you sprayed it, the amount you
[SPEAKER_00]: put in the mix when you mixed it up and
which plants you sprayed it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll say like Tuesday, this is the
date I applied these pesticides at this
[SPEAKER_00]: much on these plants at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a good documentation of when
you applied things, you know when you
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, if I say, hey, when did you
spray for spider mites last?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know that within three to five
days, it is time to treat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get an infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do have an infestation,
I need to stay on top of a tight schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticide logs are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the future, if you get some sort
of a rash that could be a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreak or a pesticide exposure,
we know that you sprayed this pesticide on
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this day, cause here it is,
you wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help the doctor out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get sick, just help yourself
out, set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticide logs are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend having, if you're in a
commercial grow, this is required,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I recommend having MSDS sheets for
almost every product you use, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, especially foliar feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also have them for all of your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that comes into that grow,
just print off an MSDS sheet, put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: folder next to your pesticide logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way any information that we need,
we've got available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something does go wrong, we've got all
the information we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nothing goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get a rash, if you get a weird
disease, we can look at all of your MSDS
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets and say, oh, he's using this
product and this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's the one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's giving him seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can figure something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that to happen to you,
but if it does happen, all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation will help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accountability will really help you out in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are keeping all of these
documents in your personal grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes time to expand into
commercial growing, you're already working
[SPEAKER_00]: with the practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already something you're programmed
to do and it's not a big whole new step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a whole bunch of new shit to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticide logs and MSDS sheets can be
invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have those around in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just thought of, if you're in an
illegal area, if you're in prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: land, that's like evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't want all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe keep that as a Google doc and maybe
have a couple of passwords or nobody can
[SPEAKER_00]: access that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were in a legal area and you
were growing, I would have the MSDS sheets
[SPEAKER_00]: and pesticide logs just as accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work well in the future for,
if you want to do some sort of applying
[SPEAKER_00]: for jobs, you could say, I've already been
keeping pesticide logs and MSDS sheets and
[SPEAKER_00]: also understand your local department of
agriculture rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that gets us through most of
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always read the labels on your pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another note that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little book on the front of the
pesticide pops open and there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: details in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reentry interval, what to look for for
exposure, how much to apply, when to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it, what personal protective equipment to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is toxic, if it's dangerous,
if it's, it's got all that is labeled on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little booklet that pops out,
there's a lot of good info in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read it if you never have, I highly
recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that covers basically like pesticide
safety and yeah, pesticide safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: application safety, the basics of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work on grow safety a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the grow, there are a lot
of things you can hurt yourself with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things I see that drive me crazy
are sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it in my grow too, but those big
sticks, if they're not tall enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're too tall, the ones that are
like four feet tall, I see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially poking their eyes on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have almost done it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a plant, it's starting to
droop on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a couple of sticks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a zip tie around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your plants stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a stick on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But tomorrow when you go to water that
plant, or maybe you're just going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the plant, you lean over, you forget
there's a stick in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stick goes right in your fucking eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put sticks in the grow
room, stakes, bamboo sticks, put something
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of that, make it a flag or put
a tennis ball or a ping pong ball at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of it to where it's not so pokey and
it's not such a eye danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things will poke you right in the
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, people seem to forget that
scissors are sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the grow room, when you're
in the trim room, you're hauling ass,
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention because those Fiskars are
fucking sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of people cut themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people cut other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention, you guys, be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have to remind you,
scissors are sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave them in random places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put them in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to carry scissors around,
use the little scissor holster that they
[SPEAKER_00]: come with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the scissors come with a little
protective thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on your belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist on putting the scissors in
your pocket, put them in that little
[SPEAKER_00]: sheath, then put them in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have to write an incident
report on you because you were just being
[SPEAKER_00]: dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scissors are sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's dumb that I have to remind
you, but some people need that fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, grow lights are hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bulbs are hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch those.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes time to change a grow light,
you can't just unscrew it and put a new
[SPEAKER_00]: one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a little bit to cool off,
depending on the size of the bulb and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long it's been running.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is probably fucking hot,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, grow lights are hot when they're
turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, blowers and extraction fans will eat
your fucking fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that you're just going to move
it or adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A blower, something like that,
turn it off, unplug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to adjust the ducting,
if you're going to move an extraction fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have cut my finger really badly on a
squirrel cage fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see that scar on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost took the tip of that finger off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why it is not shaped
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I messed myself up really badly on a
blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing work on a ceiling area of a
grow and the ceiling, one of the supports
[SPEAKER_00]: came in and the blower kind of turned and
my finger went right into the opening of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blower and the tip of it is gone
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shredded into little pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 13 stitches in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My finger, it hurts right now just
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be fucking careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those blowers are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fans everywhere in grow rooms
and personal grows and commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fans can be extremely dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a grow room, tie up your
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a ponytail, stick it in your
shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fans will cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in a commercial grow environment,
we are required to have a badge on us at
[SPEAKER_00]: all times that is visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be above the waist and below
the neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be visible by the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody looks at the camera,
they can say that guy belongs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us wear the badge on a lanyard
around our necks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, it is required that that
lanyard be a breakaway lanyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means in the middle of it,
it's got a little section that if I pull
[SPEAKER_00]: hard enough, it just breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the potential or the
opportunity to wrap around my neck and
[SPEAKER_00]: strangle me if it becomes tied in a fan or
a blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wearing a lanyard, in a grow,
and you have got fans around you,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get that lanyard caught in something
and get yourself fucking hung.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're working with a trim
machine or a trim reaper or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in front of you, don't lean over
and stick your lanyard into the trim
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the lanyard get stuck in the
wood chipper, the trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it put through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your lanyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the little arm band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell an arm band.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put your badge in there,
put it on your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dangling off of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to end up in the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to end up in the plants and
the trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to end up getting you in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get stuck in a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fans are dangerous, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got dreadlocks, long hair,
ponytails, keep that shit tucked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them tied up in a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my dreads would ruin a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if it grabbed one of these,
I'd probably just sink the fan off the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of situation you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I fit this one in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: People may not be prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety, grow room safety, it's going to
stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of being safe is not being detected
by the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legal safety, it's going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have carbon filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody says it smells like skunks,
know what you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what are you going to do if somebody
knocks on the door and wants to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed in your home without a
warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock the door, close the door behind you,
stand on the front porch and talk to law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement outside of your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they say, can we go in,
say, funny story, I'm locked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you leave and they leave too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody goes in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are approached by law enforcement,
have a plan, practice, don't get too
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when harvest time comes,
it is going to stink more than it does
[SPEAKER_00]: during the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest is stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, know where you're going to securely
store and save and dry and cure your
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about the new tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is going to stink a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about personal safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main ways to keep yourself safe
when it comes to growing is to shut the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody that doesn't need to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a lot of fun talking about
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in a completely legal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a paycheck for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who your friends are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who your ex-girlfriend is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who your ex-girlfriend's new
boyfriend is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shut the fuck up about your grow and
don't tell people unless it needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is personal safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your grow and yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't need to know, they don't
need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring people into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else needs to be there unless
they're helping you and you're paying
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else needs to be in that grow,
but you don't show it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the product is harvested,
dried, cured, and either smoked or removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from your area, post some pictures up to
social media and get some bragging rights
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't need to bring people in
there and show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads me into internet safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to talk about
when it comes to internet safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the safety of the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you revealing your identity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you revealing your location?
[SPEAKER_00]: In your pictures, are you showing that
you're allowed six plants, but in your
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, you blatantly have 18?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that type of internet safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about even further security
codes, passwords.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody hacking you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody watching you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your internet, let me try that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your internet search history?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the word I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your internet search history going to
be a problem if anybody wants to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about internet safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when you post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what is in your photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I went outside to my front yard and
took a photo, a selfie facing away from my
[SPEAKER_00]: house, but you caught my neighbor's house
in the background, you could probably look
[SPEAKER_00]: at my neighbor's address and drive around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what area I live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to triangulate my
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful with what you post on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got kids, be very careful
with the kids in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow room, make sure it is
locked and the kids do not have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're one of those people who is
growing for a sick child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're one of the people who allows
a child to help you in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that that child does not have
access to the grow without your
[SPEAKER_00]: supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are many legalities involving
children in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes me back to be careful what you
post.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not legal for that child to be in
your grow, do not post a picture of that
[SPEAKER_00]: child in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the kids out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be honest with the children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best way to teach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say what's going on down there,
say grow in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise they think there's aliens down
there and they really want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you tell them what's happening and
you're honest, they might let you get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move our way into pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like seeing cats and dogs in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people like to take their
animals in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're inclusive, but I feel that pets
are vectors of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably carrying spider mites or
some sort of bug that I don't want or a
[SPEAKER_00]: dander or a mold or some shit that I don't
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're down there low by the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the pets out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what makes you happy, but just know
that is a potential carrier for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep your pets safe if they do come
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, we're applying
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs and cats, especially dogs,
just like to eat random shit and lick at
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those nutrients and pesticides
could be very problematic for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, even for a big dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a dog ate a bottle of nutrients,
they would get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a dog ate a bottle of pesticides,
it would get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind for your pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's love our pets the best we can and
keep them safe as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow room safety, keep the pets and the
kids out of there and keep them safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I want to talk about is
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do we need to think about being
safe, we need to think about what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to the earth, to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you causing a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do something that's
irreversible?
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth is not yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little square patch that you own,
that's yours, but the rest of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else's and you only own the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't own all the air and all the bugs
that tried to fly in and out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't own the life that evolves around
that earth, around that patch of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of your environmental impact
on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing indoors or outdoors,
there are things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a bottled nutrient user, I get a lot of
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to find places to recycle,
but they don't want to recycle nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles in many locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get away from bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy bigger bottles if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy a bunch of quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy the big five gallon if you can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about ways to decrease your carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about, I'm talking
about trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We throw a lot of shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you throw out your trash,
is it possible that anybody can discover
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a grower through your trash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking in the trash, do they find
nutrient bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they finding pesticide bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they finding old scrap leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they finding old stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with your trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that goes out onto the curb,
that is public property.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops can go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your neighbors can go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hobos are probably going to go through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what they're going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to get rid of your trash more
carefully?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really long list of stuff I
want to cover and I feel like I'm already
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a ways into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always grow with the appropriate
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people building makeshift
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you don't have a unlimited
budget and you've got to work with what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of that shit gets dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most dangerous things I see is
inappropriate electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run your electricity appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the proper electric fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people just doing random crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have people who are nowhere near
certified electricians going in and just
[SPEAKER_00]: running wires and doing weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a potential hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could burn down your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sharing a building that can burn
down that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't be that person who ruined the
neighborhood because you had one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends just run some wires so we could
run more lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to have electrical
upgrades, make sure it is done by a
[SPEAKER_00]: certified registered master electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the real word, a real
electrician, somebody who's licensed and
[SPEAKER_00]: bonded.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they cause a problem, you can call them
and say it's your fault and you fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to have a license,
not just one of your bros that goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's this wire and this wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it done professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper electric is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cause a lot of problems to go with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say always have a smoke alarm,
a smoke detector in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about what you're going to do
if that goes off because that will bring
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have a fire extinguisher,
either the handheld type that is big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough for your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got like five or six lights,
you need a bigger fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got one light, you may be
okay with the smaller fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the potential problem you're
going to have to deal with and have the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment prepared to combat that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do make a fire extinguisher that
hangs from the ceiling in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it reaches a certain temperature,
it basically ruptures and it drops a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: retardant dust all over the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will destroy your garden, but it will
put out the fire and rescue the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that is an option, I highly
recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got higher ceilings,
if you've got enough space and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it, I like the fire extinguisher
that hangs from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big red ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets too hot, it simply
explodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this white powdery dust comes out
and it falls all over the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically extinguishes the fire
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a fire extinguisher is something I
highly recommend to go with your smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to catch that smoke, blast out the
fire, and then not have any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the fire extinguisher on the outside
of the grow room door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do hear that smoke alarm going off,
you're going to touch the door,
[SPEAKER_00]: see how hot it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really hot, you may just want to
fucking run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's kind of warm, push that door open,
back up, assess the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that fire extinguisher in your hand,
get going, start spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too bad, get the fuck out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys just run to get the good shit
that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the kids, get the dog and get the fuck
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to extinguish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aim at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also understand how to use your fire
extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it's fully charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that you pull the pin,
you do this, you point here, maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're intimidated by the fire
extinguisher, if you think it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be scary, just grab the fire extinguisher
and take it out to the yard and just give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a little spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what kind of pressure comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it jerks, see how it jumps around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know at a lot of places, if you go work
at a new warehouse or a new facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will actually train you in how to use
the fire extinguisher so that if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: need it, you're not in full fucking panic
mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you've done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a smoke alarm and have a fire
extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've already mentioned is a door
lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock everything twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe lock everything a third time just
for safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need anybody not invited getting
into our grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that comes back around to shut the
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't know it's there,
they don't know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got everything locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got everything safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step I think is cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put up cameras near your grow
without being obvious that you're watching
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow, that is a great thing to do
because now you know when intruders are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming and you can also check on the
plants while you're away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just open up your phone and go,
oh, that room looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the plants look super droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reservoirs are full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see most of the things I need to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up my camera store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see what I need to see and we've got
a little bit of reassurance and security
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I really like in the grow
for safety and for many other reasons is
[SPEAKER_00]: something like a PL grow minder unit or
something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will tell me if the room gets too hot
or too cold while I'm away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, if I reach a certain condition in my
grow room, my phone will beep and tell me,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you need to check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open up the app on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the PL grow minder information
and it'll say, Hey, it's 90 degrees in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go, I need to solve that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I open up the camera, look at the
camera and go, Oh, the plants definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: look hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see that that fan over there
isn't running, or I can see that that air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner, you can't see the air
conditioner cut off, but you get my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can open up the minder unit and I can
look on camera, try to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need to get to the grow, I can get
over there and fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cameras and a PL minder unit together
are invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a warning on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything is out of the parameters,
which you expect it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like is a, high heat
shutdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a device on my grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of my grow lights plug into one
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that unit plugs into the 240,
the dryer looking plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that dryer plug, I have got a high
heat shutdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It plugs into the dryer plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my light box plugs into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has a wire that goes up to the
very center of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that room reaches 110 degrees,
everything turns off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just cuts the power to that whole box.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my lights turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to heat up anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save me from roasting the entire
room and it's adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can change it from 90 to 110 is the
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just left it at 110 when I
bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a high heat shutdown to where
if the room gets too hot, the lights just
[SPEAKER_00]: shut right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not plug the air conditioner into
that same receptacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air conditioner will continue to
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was running, I'm assuming that since
it's 110 degrees in there, that air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My PL grow minder unit sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to open it up and look and say it's
100 degrees in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to go figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that high heat shutdown will shut it
down while I'm in the car running to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, trying to get there before the
plants melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need is plenty of carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to control the aroma and odors of
our grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a non-legal state,
that aroma will be enough to get you in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have enough carbon filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a carbon filter in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're extracting air, make sure that
that air is filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you can do is just set up a
carbon filter and a blower and just have
[SPEAKER_00]: it blow in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just filtering the air,
taking out the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also sucking up any dust,
anything that might be floating around,
[SPEAKER_00]: just keeping the air clean while sucking
out some aroma, keeping you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, right by the front door and any
entrances and exits of your house,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe have a little air freshener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep the cans of ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't think of what it's called right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ona gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the jars of Ona gel near the doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a jar with the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can unscrew the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't unscrew the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly get a drill and I drill six or
eight holes in the top of the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my Ona gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gel has to stay moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it dries, it stops making air or
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drill holes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the Ona gel jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put it behind a picture right by
the door so that when you come in the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, you look at the picture of my
daughter, you go, your daughter is
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know there's a fucking Ona
jar hidden behind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, it smells great in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, ah, you see my kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell my aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think I'm a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know there's a bunch of
fucking plants in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cover your aroma, Ona gels,
maybe some Osium spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use the thing that sprays every
fucking 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obvious that you're hiding
something, but carbon filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ona gels, those will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I see people make mistakes
is timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot handle the load, which we are
assigning to these timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plug the timer into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we plug a thousand watt light into
that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we plug 2000 watt lights into
that timer and we expect that timer to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off and on every day as it's supposed
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we didn't think about is we're
running 2000 watt lights on this one
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty timer and it's going to melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not have the capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that the timers you buy are
strong enough to run the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity you are pushing through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity can be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this recently in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not be the person burning down the
house by drawing too much electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: through one receptacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like your equipment,
if the plugin at the wall is getting hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your timer is getting hot, if your
extension cord is getting hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thick enough, strong enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a bigger, more powerful,
heavier duty timer and extension cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like extension cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shitty extension cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be the big, thick insulated
extension cord or get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bring in that little, the one that
you're going to use to plug in the printer
[SPEAKER_00]: or the extension cord for your phone,
don't put that in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the extension cords have to be
quality extension cords, the good thick
[SPEAKER_00]: kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always, like we talked about earlier,
keep your electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a bunch of cords on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a bunch of extension cords down
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your electricity up high tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is water on the floor,
you don't have any interaction between the
[SPEAKER_00]: electric and the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is going to go straight to the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that electricity up high,
three feet off the ground or higher is
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no shitty extension cords and be very
careful with your cords, your cables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about, be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't trip over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have them in places where they're
going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you really need to think
about and have prepared in a grow is a
[SPEAKER_00]: first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to have to use it,
but I hope that it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked earlier about a friend getting pH
down on his eye, wiped or on his finger,
[SPEAKER_00]: wiped his eye, pH down in his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's got a call 911.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a terrible situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to walk up the grow and scramble up
to the top of the stairs and get outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of his house before anybody showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he didn't get himself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a first aid kit on hand is what I'm
getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something does go wrong, you would much
rather have a first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: First aid kit to take care of yourself
than have to scramble around and find all
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit to handle yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut yourself, you're going to need
some gauze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some band-aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some peroxide to clean
yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a couple of butterfly band-aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit of burn cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're just a clumsy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you were always hurting yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what you do to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know as guys, I know that I like to cut
my fingers a lot, doing dumb shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to pry something open.
[SPEAKER_00]: These regions of our hands, they get cut
up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some band-aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have something to clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some of those butterflies around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple sizes of band-aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, eye wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people overlook eye wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy a bottle of eye wash from
Uline is the place where we get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the bottles of eye wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do get a pesticide in your eye,
if you get something in your eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: grab that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little spout on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is take off the cap and
squeeze it right into your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will rinse your eyes out, help you out
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can get more help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have that eye wash around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we're
required to have an eye wash within,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the exact amount of feet
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't admit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to read the rules again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, if you're applying a
pesticide, you need eye wash within reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tell the guys to carry a bottle of
water or the little eye wash bottle on
[SPEAKER_00]: their person while applying a pesticide so
that if you fuck up, if the fan blows the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide into your eyes, you can just
reach into your pocket, rinse your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: off right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go too far because you
are blinded with shit in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to find your way out
of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have eye wash available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I talked about my friend who had to
use Siri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making sure Siri doesn't fire up
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did turn her off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who had to use Siri to
call 911 to get himself medical help when
[SPEAKER_00]: he got pH down in his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a better option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an emergency contact plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you going to call if something
goes wrong in your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who I'm going to call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put that person in my phone and I've
got their name in my phone door.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I have to do is say, Hey, call this
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Siri will dial that person's number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to use my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to use my site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it just with my voice if I unlock
my phone with my thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have some sort of a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If shit does go wrong, who are you going
to call?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ghostbusters aren't going to be there
to help you with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an emergency contact in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have their phone number planned into your
phone, programmed into your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what's your excuse?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got to go to the doctor,
if you got to go to the hospital because
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut yourself in the grow room or
because you got something in your eye,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is your excuse?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us can't go to the hospital and
say, I was growing weed and I cut myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go, sweet, we're sending
the fucking cops to your house right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to keep you here while
they're over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as you get done,
we're going to arrest you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan, have an alibi, have an
excuse, know what you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the worst part that you can
think of, but it's the last thing on my
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about some bail money and a lawyer on
retainer?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were getting into the grow game and
you've got a couple of harvests under your
[SPEAKER_00]: belt and you're starting to make a name
for yourself, and this is something you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a lawyer and you need bail money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that bail money at your lawyer's
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where anything goes wrong, you call
your lawyer and he goes, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already on retainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've paid him a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay him every couple of months just to
keep him on your side.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that money in his safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when shit goes wrong, he just drives
right over, pays your bail money and gets
[SPEAKER_00]: you moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that bail money and that lawyer on
retainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then have your lawyer's phone number in
your phone and also try to memorize it
[SPEAKER_00]: because when your handcuffs and you're
being booked, you don't get your phone to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through all those phone numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to know his number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember your emergency contacts,
phone number, and remember your lawyer's
[SPEAKER_00]: phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that lawyer on retainer and have some
bail money set aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to have to use the
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to have to use the fire
extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to have to use the first
aid kit, but if we need them, I want them
[SPEAKER_00]: to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always better to have the shit you
need on hand and be prepared and set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success than it is to try
to figure shit out while you're panicking
[SPEAKER_00]: and under stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
clone cutters and Paul and Chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you found some useful information
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want you to grow the best
cannabis you can, but I also want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: be as safe and healthy as possible while
doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please take care of yourself,
pay attention and be mindful in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself and your grow partners safe
and healthy.
