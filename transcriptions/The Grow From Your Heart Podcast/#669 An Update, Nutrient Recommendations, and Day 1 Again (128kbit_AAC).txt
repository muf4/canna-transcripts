[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to send a big thank you shout
out to my buddy Mobius Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out and big thank you for the
great tester update report video.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Mobius is testing some seeds for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running a test grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I received a great email with a
detailed video.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walks around the grow and he says,
this is one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some traits each phenotype has.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are commonalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the room is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like I was hanging out with my own
plants and his grow, hanging out with my
[SPEAKER_00]: babies and his grow, hanging out with his
babies and his grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great work from a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're testing for me, please do
send videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a FaceTime video with my kids
or something is like, here's the babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get play playing in the playground with
each other, looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mobius, good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish more testers would be like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's segue right into this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will need more testers very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been sending me tester
applications, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are saved in a folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not delete those, throw those away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in a folder on the desktop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I need some testers,
I just go right to the email, open up that
[SPEAKER_00]: folder and I can find all the applicants
in there, go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find some good candidates that I think may
be a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not already applied to be a
tester, there's a full episode about being
[SPEAKER_00]: a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you listen to that episode,
then apply following the instructions
[SPEAKER_00]: within that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk recently about Mephisto
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to make an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz, the guy that I knew that I had a
friendship with from Mephisto Genetics has
[SPEAKER_00]: now started what is known as Night Owl
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Night Owl
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your auto flowering seeds needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do support Daz, great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check them out if you're
into the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have a question here in
front of me that I do want to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I read a question
about a commercial grow whose plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't finishing on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted to send me a lot of
suggestions, a lot of ideas on what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did receive a lot of great input,
a lot of great ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there were a lot of small
adjustments and small details that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make a big enough impact overall
in this commercial grow to make it worth
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, energy, money and effort to make
those changes in this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about if we're gonna make a small
adjustment in your grow, think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, energy and cost it takes to make it
in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then think if we're gonna do that in a
commercial environment, it costs 100 times
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it to one light,
we're doing it to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to repeat the process 100 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to buy the equipment 100 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to take the manpower or womanpower
to install or adjust or adapt that new
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to test the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to learn the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time to have people come
in there, a lot of money, a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the long run, if you've got
your personal grow with two, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, however many small ones, the lights
you've got going, I'm not downplaying your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying your personal grow is a small
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we're doing
things on an exponential scale compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've got going at home in most
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a commercial environment,
we're getting very little return on our
[SPEAKER_00]: investment after staffing, after payroll,
after the rent on the building,
[SPEAKER_00]: the electricity on the building,
licensing, taxes, packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation fees, workman's comp
lawyers, the lawyer, the accountant,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that stuff, eats into all of our
profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it's just you, your trimming
partner, and hopefully the lawyer is all
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got that lawyer on retainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing, everybody growing
should have a lawyer no matter what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have a lawyer anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is that in a home grow,
your return on investment is much greater
[SPEAKER_00]: and our return on investment in a
commercial grow is much smaller because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have much more expenses, many more
expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making small adjustments like that are
much more costly than it would be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to repeat it a hundred times if
we have a hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some great recommendations,
things like changing the light spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: and changing the temperature in the night,
things like that, that would help,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not to the degree which we need help
in this commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were obviously being
flowered, being veg for two or three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just needed to be done sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't, it was a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: People said, raise the fans, raise the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commercial grow, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably got three foot tall tables,
12 foot lights, 18 foot ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've maxed out with what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just raise the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go around and put blue lights up
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where's the profit?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a commercial grow, then where
did the profit go?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to replace half of them with blue
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 50 bulbs you got to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a hundred dollars each.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do the math on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not a real number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so there were a lot of great
ideas, but most of them are not feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main solution to that is better
scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants were too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're repeatedly too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing into the lights or going
into the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easy logical solution is flower
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't grow them so damn big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less time on the road is less time for a
crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if those plants are only in the room
for a total of like four weeks of veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking nine weeks of flower, that's two
or three weeks less opportunity for power.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good setup for this one message
that I did get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one says Rasta Jeff question on
what you said on not being able to shorten
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that episode, I did say that we can't
shorten the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have to flower for their nine
or 10 weeks until they're finished and
[SPEAKER_00]: that we should shorten the veg phase
because then you make, you just start with
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't grow them as big and they don't
finish as big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense to me, but this one was a
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, isn't that what new millennium
winter frost claims to do on the dude grow
[SPEAKER_00]: show?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Jaren, the new millennium guy said
you can get different strains to finish at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes, the new millennium product,
uh, the winter frost product from new
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium will cause the plants to go
into their finishing stage a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will go into senescence a little bit
sooner when you feed them that product,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will be triggered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's something in there that tells
them, Hey, it's the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to go to the end phase,
but would you rather have a room that's
[SPEAKER_00]: proper or would you rather have to feed a
product that is going to trigger the
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could put a bandaid on it and
spend all kinds of money on this product,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you could fix the schedule and do it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and also this product isn't going to
cut two or three weeks off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may cut five, maybe seven days,
maybe 10 at the most, but it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut that many days off your full cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grow we were talking about,
it sounded like they needed two,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three full weeks cut off of their
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great idea to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new millennium winter frost,
but it's not going to be a drastic enough
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, speaking of drastic changes,
here's another great thing we can talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about diurnal temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we narrow down that swing, if we don't
have more than five degrees between our
[SPEAKER_00]: day and night swing and maybe five or 10%
humidity between our day and night swing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help with the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That initial stretch into the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping and twisting the stems,
uh, cracking the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, the ultimate solution as a,
as the consultant who sees the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is an experienced grower who's
been in these commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that was just flower
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you going to grow 10 foot tall
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got a 14 foot ceiling,
grow five foot tall plants, flower them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got four feet of extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think ahead, plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that before be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me hit my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recap myself, get myself back on track,
make sure we're doing this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes, question about winter frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do have more emails in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to give this person a shout out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want their name said this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not leave their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but big shout out, you know who you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sparking great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am awful rambly today, so I do need to
keep myself on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this message is trolling
me or if this was 100% serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trolling, me a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not trolling me,
uh, listen, this time it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm growing a few
of your strains and I'm just curious when
[SPEAKER_00]: to start counting flowering days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I start at light switch of 1212 or when
I start seeing pre flowers, then it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard on an episode that you said you
start counting at the light switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start counting at the light switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or should I add some weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work and I will continue
to work with you and your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my friend Saul, you heard me,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always start counting flowering days on
an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day I flipped the lights to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look into this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say it at another angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, and I recommend you always start
counting flowering days and an indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from the day you flip the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: To 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a unique, creative, fancy
flowering light cycle, like maybe 1113 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, start counting the
day you change that timer to 1212 or 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't adjust that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we put 63 days of flowering and
then you start flowering on this day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then subtract 14 days or add 14 days I
didn't put a math problem on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says nine weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the day you start flowering is day one
at the end of nine weeks, not at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of nine weeks either.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say I've gone eight full weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to chop down tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, you've got the ninth week to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say week nine is tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, Hey, you still got to,
you've got to finish that week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to finish the ninth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says nine to 10 weeks, let it go 10
completed weeks, 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are going to take nine to 10
weeks from the day you flip that timer to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go in there and you change the
timer from nine PM on to nine AM off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not 12 hours off 12 hours on in
your 24 hour day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a screenshot on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some sort of a note that says day one
of flowering is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This day, maybe get a piece of duct tape
and write that date on the piece of duct
[SPEAKER_00]: tape and stick that duct tape on the door
or possibly on the pot of the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that note somewhere that you will
find it that you will not forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got weird OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flower on the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know that in two months,
the next first on that third month will be
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I start flowering January 1st,
we got all of January, got all of
[SPEAKER_00]: February, March 1st, I got a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that a little bit before
March 1st, I need to get my next crop
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just planning thinking like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been going on for a long time
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many times I can say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to stress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering day one starts the day that you
flip the timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoors, that's a different
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know when we change the timer to
1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pay attention to your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about watching the plants most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was going to segue into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calendar is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation on the seed package is a
great thing, but there will be variables
[SPEAKER_00]: like always in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay attention to your
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes on your plant are what
indicate ripeness when those trichomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: turning amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say somewhere between 20 and
30% amber trichomes on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, that is when it is a good time to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are the thing that contain
the active ingredient, the active
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, which give us a buzz that make
us stoned, that contain THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN, CBG, all of the other wonderful
cannabinoids we're seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all in our trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the trichome ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trichome farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think they're growing big,
beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing you are working on is
beautiful trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since I'm on this path, this rant
pistol, or you guys call them hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hairs do not have anything with
indication of ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hairs, those pistols are the
breeding parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things can change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will say when the hairs
turn brown or when the pistols turn brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when the plants are finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is false.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those parts are for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those parts of the plant can be damaged,
destroyed, withered, ruined from all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spray will make your pistols,
can make your pistols of your plants turn
[SPEAKER_00]: brown and wither up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your skin oil touching it can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant just passing up its point of
peak pollination can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants only want pollen for so long
into their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a time when they can reproduce
and then that time expires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that time expires on a plant,
the pistols turn brown and dry up and
[SPEAKER_00]: wither up and shrink in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will say at that point,
this plant is ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people would be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pistols, those hairs do not have any
indicator, any indication, anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ripeness of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trichome farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want ripe trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're breeding for seeds,
trichomes are all you should be measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: ripeness by.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding for seeds, then of
course measure by the hardness and
[SPEAKER_00]: ripeness of the seeds inside of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good rant for the same
question I've been asked a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one pops up at least once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping, and this person has already
heard it, this is gonna be the third time
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've heard me say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set your timer to 12-12 and that is
day one of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start counting flowering
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wrote 10 weeks on the seed package,
that means you've got to let it finish
[SPEAKER_00]: week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it go to week 10 and cut it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go through week 10 and cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly for funsies, let it go a little
bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now since we're on this sort of
a path, this topic here, here's something
[SPEAKER_00]: funny that I see on social media all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what inspires this sort of a
thought process, but I think that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times on social media,
I will see something that says something
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I'm only two weeks away from week
nine, which means you are in week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just say I'm in week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only two weeks away from week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it that you want to make it sound
like you're further for your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tricking yourself to think I am
only this far away, but just be realistic
[SPEAKER_00]: with yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say I am in the end of week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are saying I'm two weeks
away from week nine and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: technically in the end of week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be realistic with yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you have realistic expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like little kids saying, it's only
one month till Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only 24 days away till Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, but let's not get too excited
for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at it realistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes me giggle on social media
when I see that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hatred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what the next message is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That message did come from our friend
Saul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Saul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, 12-12 is the day you flip that
timer, or day one is the day you flip that
[SPEAKER_00]: timer to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get refocused here and work on the
next message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from another friend who
calls themselves Heaven and Hell and their
[SPEAKER_00]: question says, Hey, hey, hey, Master Rasta
Jeff, the man with the magic breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that that was a thing,
but that is a great way to start a
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one hell of an intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I was wondering what nutrient
line you would recommend for your top
[SPEAKER_00]: three brands, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an ever-evolving, ever-changing
question for me because I do get to try a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get sent free things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get sent samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked to try things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends give me a lot of input and a
lot of feedback on products they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working in a lot of commercial
environments, I had a lot of space and
[SPEAKER_00]: places to experiment with new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep going back to a few of the same
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the top three that I
would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a very long time, I was having great
success with the Botanicare line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using Botanicare, Pure Blend Pro,
Liquid Karma, the Calmag, the Silica
[SPEAKER_00]: Blast, the Hydra Guard or Hydra Plex,
maybe both.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a couple other great products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Bloom Booster that I can't think
of the name of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a few other products that they
were adding to their mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would add a couple other key
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I always add a couple of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I get a brand, I like to add a
couple of things, but I was having great
[SPEAKER_00]: success with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there were some political
reasons why I chose to kind of sway away
[SPEAKER_00]: from Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mainly political reasons and I was
seeing great success with another brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the other brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other brand I switched to that I have
great success with and I still use on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular basis is New Millennium Bottled
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think New Millennium is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it's formulated, just the way it's
measured out, it's easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the plants grow with great vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out with good potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finish on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got products that help us finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got products that help them root.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the nutrients are broken down and
the bottles are broken down makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their nutrient calculator and schedule is
easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaren and Neil are good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got good customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, nobody pays me to talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have big jugs of New Millennium
Bottles sitting around or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually bump into Jaren at a couple
of concerts this weekend and we'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up and give each other a fist bump
and won't talk about business at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me to advertise their
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me free stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did give me a free hat and I've
gotten a few free bottles, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to advertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying it's good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to buy it and I still go buy it at
the grow store most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Millennium, good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Botanicare is a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I switched using it mainly for political
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't too worried about dollars
and ethics and political stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare makes a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about where your money's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pay attention to that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Botanicare website, they have a
great nutrient calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type in which bottles you've got,
how many weeks of veg you expect to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many weeks of flour you expect,
and it will tell you every week what to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two brands that I really enjoyed
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Botanicare and New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had good experience with Veg Bloom
from Hydroponic Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a great product for a
commercial grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked a lot about Veg Bloom and
commercial grow environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you asked for three, but I also
want to recommend BioBiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioBiz makes an affordable product,
very easy to use, and the product that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're finished flowers will taste so good
with BioBiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with all of that being said,
let me make a couple of recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be very limited with what is
available to you in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're shopping online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're shopping at a local
hydroponic store or a gardening center or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is available where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to the store to get what
is available, I recommend you shop around
[SPEAKER_00]: and get what is there on the shelf so you
don't have to pay extra for shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping costs are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sending bottles of water across the
country can get ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe find something at the local grow
store that will suit your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do some research on brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking earlier that one brand I
really enjoyed, I swear, which because of
[SPEAKER_00]: political and other reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe read about who is attached to who,
who are the parent companies, who are the
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella companies to that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that matters, do you pay attention to
that sort of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be easier for you to find products
locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be more reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be easier for you to build your
arsenal up that way slowly over time
[SPEAKER_00]: locally than it would be to have stuff
shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can't have grow products shipped
straight to your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you order bottles of grow
nutrients, it will come just as that
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of grow nutrients with plastic wrap
wrapped around it and then some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: security tape around the lid so it doesn't
come popped open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole neighborhood knows you just
got a bottle of whatever Pure Blend Pro
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic Tea sitting on the front porch
until you got home from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sat out there all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows who drove by?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows who was walking the dogs and saw
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows how many other neighborhood kids
walked by and they grow weed too and they
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the fuck you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they know that you grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to source your
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they going to come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get it at your local grow store?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something else I wanted to add
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient calculators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at all of the nutrient calculators
and nutrient schedules online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the website for the brand that
you intend to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to stick with, if you're picking a
brand, I say that I like adding stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to start with the brand and if you're
going to use, let's just say that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Millennium actually sells a great
starter pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that starter pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use their website for their
nutrient calculator and feed it like it
[SPEAKER_00]: says on the nutrient calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get all of the stuff on your
wish list, start with the basics that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need like a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in veg or in bloom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your bases for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get your Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get your rooting supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get your bloom boosters and just add
them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you harvest, maybe for your
next run, get a couple of more bottles if
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as every time you go to the
store, you can get one or two more bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you were a kid and you're just
trying to expand your Lego sets or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get another game for the PlayStation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just invest in new bottles every time
you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then find a brand that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide you don't like it,
it's okay to switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem with brand loyalty in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can switch brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can switch mid-grow if you really want
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they're getting fed and getting
what they need, the plants may be happier
[SPEAKER_00]: if you switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went from a shitty product to a
better product, they're eating better,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may be happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But learn a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a crop or two with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a crop or two with other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you can afford the space and the
products and the time and the energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe do two side by sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do a new millennium run and
whatever, a Botanicare run and maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: BioBiz run and then some other brand
that's local at your store that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those runs all together and see what
works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you asked for three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say new millennium bottled
nutrients, Botanicare, and Hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: Research's VegBloom products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably my top three favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VegBloom is my favorite for commercial
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wasn't doing commercial growing,
I'd probably swap that one out with BioBiz
[SPEAKER_00]: for my third reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think I've been rambling on
for long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I need a drink, so I'm going
to start wrapping up this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank my buddy Heaven Hell for
the great message.
