[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call these Thursday episodes,
the Thursday Quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: These quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on with the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 303 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the Thursday Quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these episodes off by
letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been getting down on the
Clementine high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you listen to the podcast
frequently, you know I get down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, I've complained that the
Clementine lacks in high, but has a great
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking the high cannabinoid
full spectrum extracts, and this shit is
[SPEAKER_00]: not lacking in anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the high, it's got the flavor,
it's got a head buzz that you could not
[SPEAKER_00]: forget, but you could forget your keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could forget where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great concentrate for during the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make me lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been enjoying that all day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The car smells like lemons just from
having this in the car with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cooler smells like oranges and
pineapples just from keeping it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tremendous concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got home and I wanted to switch
things up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick off the shoes and chill out and do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I started smoking on the Tahoe
OG live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got me just kind of mellow,
just kind of chilled out, able to sit down
[SPEAKER_00]: in a chair and relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the Clementine keeping my head
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Tahoe OG chilling my body out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me in a great mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep it quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it a quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start by reading some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to send me an email,
my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quick question about dab tools
and it is spurred on by your recent
[SPEAKER_00]: mention of the dangers of using a pen to
take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me preface that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a glass pencil as a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was given to me as a gift by the
dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was made by a glass artist known as
Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes pencils and other glass
apparatuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this glass pencil dabber sitting on
my table next to the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to my rig, next to my notebook,
next to my other pen, next to my beverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: next to a folder, next to my torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of shit on this table is
what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clusterfuck of dab things and
recording stuff and podcast notes and hash
[SPEAKER_00]: containers and beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a clusterfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got this glass pencil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have picked up this glass pencil that is
meant to be used as a dabber and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to write a note with it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work because it's not a pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on a recent episode, I think Kevin
and Mike were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been episode 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up my pen, my Bic pen,
my Papermate ballpoint pen thinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: this was my glass dabber and I almost put
a dab on this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached toward the concentrate and said,
oh shit, that is a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what this is referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this spurred on from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says, I have a quick question about
dab tools and it's spurred on by your
[SPEAKER_00]: recent mention of the dangers of using a
pen to take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been dangerous if I had
taken a dab with that pen, you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm gonna talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is it okay to use
stainless steel dabbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people use titanium or
glass rods but I don't know about
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still kind of a rookie with my gear
and I repurposed a piece of 316 stainless
[SPEAKER_00]: steel TIG welding rod to get my dabs in
the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume many tools are made out of
stainless and I certainly know better than
[SPEAKER_00]: to use my mild steel, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any insight on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and take it easy, signed,
no name.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I wanna write a couple of notes
because I'm off on a rant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna not forget anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you know about metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a welder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be honest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what 316 stainless steel
honestly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't know the difference between
420, 215, and 316 stainless steel if you
[SPEAKER_00]: smacked me in the face with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't identify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you know more about metals
than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you hear people using titanium and
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the main reason is safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the exact opposite reason why dabbing
from this pen would have been dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pen would have melted into the banger
and the plastic would have melted and
[SPEAKER_00]: caused all kinds of funky gases to go into
my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have, I may have died had I
dabbed with the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have done it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was paying more attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was exaggerating the likelihood of me
actually doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I picked up the pen and was like,
oh, that's not your dabber, dumbass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just made a joke out of it but I
wasn't really gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I exaggerated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I had pressed this pen against a
red hot dabber, a dab nail, at first I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have smoked some ink and then I
would have smoked the little tip and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have smoked this clear plastic and
then I would have smoked a lot of ink and
[SPEAKER_00]: then darker plastic and it would have
happened pretty quickly because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have went and I would have inhaled
and I would have gotten toxic smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room would have smelled like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have ruined the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just throw away that rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably have to drive to the hospital and
figure out how to get this shit out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pen would have been the extreme
side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to dab a pen, plastic crap
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want clean quality concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay a lot of money for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you ask about titanium or glass rods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's recommended because there's no off
gassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality titanium is titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get titanium from highly educated,
Task Rock says it is 99.9% pure titanium
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the high quality titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two different grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's grade one and grade two or grade A
and grade B.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the point one that he leaves out
to say that it's titanium is because of
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It conditions like moisture and oxygen
that he cannot control that are inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason we use the glass and
titanium is because there's no off
[SPEAKER_00]: gassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's going to melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get any toxins in our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you heat up metals, you and my friend
are a metal worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you weld.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you work with metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know about metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people listening may not be aware
that when you heat up a metal,
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are oxides or oxidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't read up on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I know very little about this,
but I know enough to give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you heat up certain metals,
they create off gases and you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to inhale those gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Titanium can do it also is what I read,
but it has the least likelihood of off
[SPEAKER_00]: gassing of all of the metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use titanium if you can, but in a pinch
you can use whatever, but I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend not to use some shitty metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you know about stainless
steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend stainless steel next in
line from titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dental tools, like the dental picks
that you see, that's probably your next
[SPEAKER_00]: bet, best bet, safest bet to titanium,
which are surgical steel, medical grade
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stainless steel should be legit as long
as it's not soft, shitty hot dog metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with what you're dabbing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I would recommend stainless
steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go with anything like a paper
clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a pinch, dude, do what you
got to do to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a serious pinch,
get a fork and bend that fucker and use
[SPEAKER_00]: the fork if you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't do it a lot and go low temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: High temperatures and shitty metals is
where things are going to happen and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smell it, but it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That metal and the heat is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens when metal gets hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to melt and when shit melts,
it lets off a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got something that's got like
a chrome plating or something on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to smoke that chrome plating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want any of that shit in your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still kind of a rookie with your gear and
you've repurposed a piece and don't be shy
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're a rookie and I'm proud of you
for asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I know better than to use mild
steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you know what you're doing
with metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably trust your judgment to
the other listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use any cheap shitty metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't use a screwdriver because
it's probably got some oil or some grease
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get yourself a decent dabber,
a dental tool, a dab tool, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stainless steel, titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass is always easy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass is abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find these pencil styled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you buy glass from a
local glass artist that is going to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: his bills, pays electricity, buy more
oxygen, buy more gas for his torch,
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrade his torch, keep his tools in line,
buy more glass, support your local glass
[SPEAKER_00]: artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, buy a dabber from them,
a glass dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, most of the head shops now are
carrying pencil dabbers for very
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go pick up yourself a glass dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find something cheap at your local
head shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safer than using some crappy metal
that you found laying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my friend who sent this, trust your
judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you know more about metal than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people capping their
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're, if you know what I'm
talking about, you know what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this doesn't make any sense,
I'll kind of explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a dab, you heat up the
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the banger is the part that the
dab goes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know so many tools, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig is the actual small pipe,
bubbler slash mini bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a small one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small pipe that the smoke is going to
go through, that is your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nail part that I'm using currently is
a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a glass elbow with basically a glass
thimble on it is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using a thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to it than that,
but we're going to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a glass thimble and you heat
it up and you put your hash in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you cap it, you create kind of a
vacuum inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you inhale, that heat is trapped
in there and it's stokes your dab heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get more of the dab at a lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to heat it and sizzle off
all the flavor and burn your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it low temp and still cook all
the hash, all the concentrate and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times there's not a carb cap
around or people lost it or they're lazy
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's fucking just out of reach and your
stoner friend can't hear you going,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, give me the carb cap, carb cap,
cap, cap while you're trying to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will just pick up some random
shit and cap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people use the bottom of
their hash jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people use those silicone
concentrate containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people use random shit to cap their
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that shit's gonna melt one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever's on the bottom of your cap,
you're dabbing that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're paying a lot of money for these
concentrates and we're calling it medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're dabbing that's on the
bottom of these jars, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing on that silicone container,
that's not probably good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be careful, be aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you wanna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an adult, but just think about what
you may be melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you may be smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to improve our health,
improve the quality of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention, think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just be wanting to get high so badly
that you're willing to fuck up your
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting at the age to where I'm
noticing all of those mistakes that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was 20, they are hitting me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, that's from that night that
I drank seven bottles of whiskey probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: is why this little spot right here in my
stomach hurts and I have no explanation
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit like that starts adding up when you
get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't break yourself while you're
young.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting old, you know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably getting wise anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat it like a medicine, not like
something you're jonesing for and respect
[SPEAKER_00]: your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that'll get you through life
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so, hey dude, thank you for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear more emails from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hang out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get together, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had fun last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to keep this quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, Hey Jeff, the fam and I went for
a drive on Saturday to scout some possible
[SPEAKER_00]: camping spots for the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were up north, up past Fort Collins,
and this is a fellow Colorado in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came across an area where people had
been dumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out to check it out because the
piles looked oddly familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, a whole bunch of cannabis root balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sad sight to see all these root
balls littered all over our mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have attached a few photos I took so you
can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked, you guys, it's like,
I can't by the distance, I can't tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either three, five, or seven gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of them just scattered
about in the national forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like in this little area where you're
lazy enough just to pull off the road and
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of your truck and just dump all
these pots and then get back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how far off the road they went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a lot of them and it was
hideous and it was embarrassing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm gonna continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, we agree on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that this is total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't call myself a cannabis advocate or
an activist or whatever, although other
[SPEAKER_00]: people have labeled me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel, I don't know, just felt weird to
say it just now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a spokesperson and a, whatever,
a spokesperson, I can't think of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spokesperson for cannabis, there's
another word that I wanna use that I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: find right now in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come to me at like four in the
morning and I'll wake up and start
[SPEAKER_00]: recording again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a spokesperson, an ambassador.
[SPEAKER_00]: Booyakasha.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an ambassador for cannabis,
as somebody that represents the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to teach everybody to do it right,
that shit's embarrassing and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: setback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the people that do that
type of shit are not listening to this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to think, I'm sure somebody that
listens to this podcast is doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: dipshit fuckery right now, but I'd like to
believe that my audience and my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: are not the people dumping their root
balls in our national forest up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: land where my friend wanted to take his
family to go camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of pots and the amount of space
that took was about the same size that
[SPEAKER_00]: your car and your tent would take to camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much land they are wasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they are root balls, but you guys
be responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This probably wasn't any of you that are
listening, but let's encourage your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends or if you know somebody that does
this type of shit, let's remind them that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have been given, it's a right now
because it is in our constitution,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people had to work hard for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been given the right to grow this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been given this plant to treat
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be respectful to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only to this plant, we have to be
respectful to this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we rely on to grow this plant
comes from this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you destroy this planet,
we cannot grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's not all yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that land that you threw that
fucking cocoa or that soil on was part of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine and I don't fucking want it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter needs that forest for
something in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want my daughter to live that
fucking bumper sticker that says daddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: daddy, what we're forest like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's teach each other to respect the
earth more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be doing your part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Politely say, man, pick that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see somebody, I'm six foot five and I
weigh 200 pounds, maybe it's easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see somebody litter or throw a
cigarette butt on the floor, I tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick that shit up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say it just like that just because
they know better and it clicks in their
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, you're right, I'm a shit bag and
they pick up their cigarette butt and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully that rings with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they go, man, that tall white
guy with dreadlocks that looked fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: homeless was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not be flicking my cigarette
butts on the floor like a bag of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just say, hey man, I wouldn't throw
that shit out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just encourage each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me, would you please speak on
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'll rant on this all fucking night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hideous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I'm not speaking to the
right people because I'm sure that my
[SPEAKER_00]: audience is not throwing their root balls
out there and if you are, quit doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been given this gift,
this blessing to grow cannabis without
[SPEAKER_00]: going to jail, without getting raided,
without getting our dog shot and our
[SPEAKER_00]: livelihood taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to drive out to the
national forest or a camping area where my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy wanted to go camp with his family
and throw your fucking waste out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking dirt out in the national forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's shit baggery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay the money to take it to the dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay the money to take it to a farm and let
a farmer recycle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might want to stir that shit into his
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might need that for something or could
be in a bag of shit and learn to recycle
[SPEAKER_00]: it somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait until you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste that much shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw it in our land.
[SPEAKER_00]: This land is your land.
[SPEAKER_00]: This land is my land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both of our shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit fucking it up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit putting X marks on the cannabis
fucking world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want wins, not losses and shit like
this is a loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more pluses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not growing from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is growing from your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is being an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me off on a good rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do anything about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You did because you sent me this email and
you taught the kids not to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit, but it might be a cool field
trip to take the kids out there and have
[SPEAKER_00]: some other friends come with you and help
clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Fort Collins, like four hours away
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's plan some cleanup kind of shit like
that because that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I went off on a good
rant right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys found some good spots to
go camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a great camping summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.

cannabis into a national forest.
