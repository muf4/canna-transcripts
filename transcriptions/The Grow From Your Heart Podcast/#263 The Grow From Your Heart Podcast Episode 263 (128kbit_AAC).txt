[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were hanging out in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost revealed the location.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were at a secret location in a lovely
basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were smoking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the windows open on a lovely
Colorado summer evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me is my new friend, Quinton.

[SPEAKER_06]: This is the hangout.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the dry and cure spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: For right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They smell delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as I walked down here,

[SPEAKER_06]: Good job on whoever did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was John.

[SPEAKER_06]: How do my listeners find you on social

[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

[SPEAKER_10]: I just have some Bud pictures and some

[SPEAKER_06]: I just have some Bud pictures on there.

[SPEAKER_06]: Truly living.
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly living organics.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check them out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check them out on the social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow all my friends here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve actually invited me here to do this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve, you guys probably remember if you
listen to the show, he is the founder,
[SPEAKER_06]: president, chair dude, main veteran of the
Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: For my listeners that haven't been
following, will you give us a little
[SPEAKER_06]: description of what the VFA does?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I hold events for vets,
bring them out of isolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We give them a hundred dollars in cash and
prizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We give them medicated cookies,
medicated barbecue ribs, chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're eventually going to move to live
music, but we give away genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, nutrients, just grow gear,
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you basically hold big parties at
cannabis friendly venues and invite
[SPEAKER_06]: veterans that are in need, get them out of
their house, put a smile on their face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of ignoring them like a lot of
society has chosen to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way it works is I get company and
other organizations involved and they make
[SPEAKER_02]: a donation to where it's what they provide
as a product to the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they give it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you know, we're going to
probably have around $40,000 in genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: to give away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to list off some of the people
that are helping out with that event?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me pull it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And dude, thank you for doing what you do
for the veterans and also for being a
[SPEAKER_06]: veteran.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve is a veteran, which is what inspired
him to be so proactive for his fellows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we've talked about it on the
show, but Steve's got a hole in his back
[SPEAKER_06]: from taking an IED, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: EFP.
[SPEAKER_06]: EFP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll learn all these terms.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many military leaders.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically, he got blowed the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a hole in his back about kidney
height that is seriously, you could hide a
[SPEAKER_06]: baseball in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could smuggle a baseball in that hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put Wilson in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always have a friend, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that you've got a good positive
attitude about it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure that took a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took about seven and a half years to
really pull out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, just lots of good
cannabis helps as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good, just a good support system
is what was really important for my
[SPEAKER_02]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm proud of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to sound like a cheesy bro,
but it's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people get blowed the fuck up and
go the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's who you're trying to help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to the sponsors.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we got Smoke and Iguanas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be donating some glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

[SPEAKER_02]: We have Under the Clouds.

[SPEAKER_02]: We have Iron Protection Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be providing security for
the whole venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dab Lounge, which is holding the
venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dan's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Dry Sift Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glenn, he's going to be doing a Dry Sift
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll probably give one or two kits away
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Tiger Stripe Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_06]: New guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're new to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how new they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: New to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we got our company, which is Colorado
Veterans Collective.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something we're going to talk a
whole bunch about here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we got Danny Dengster Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we got Jim Blushy from Blues
Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Jim?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we got Nectar for the Gods,
which is sponsoring all the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: You shared some cannabis that you grew
with Nectar of the Gods.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was godlike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Sunset Sherbet you gave me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Sunset Sherbet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we smoked Heart of Gold and then
something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, good job on the Heart of Gold.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've even grown the shit out of that one
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that's my genetics,
so I always love tasting it and seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Sunset.
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoyed that more than the Heart of
Gold, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flavor on that was so bold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I described it in my head as if you take a
purple Laffy Taffy and hold it in your
[SPEAKER_06]: mouth for a couple of minutes and let it
start to melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what that would taste like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good work on that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my favorite thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you could see Steve's face right
now because he just lit up like a little
[SPEAKER_06]: kid on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone just showed him boobs.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, I love to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: He just got a huge smile.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in my face all day and I'm happy
about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: When is this Veteran Farmers Alliance
event happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Friday, November 11th on
Veterans Day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't do any better than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday, November 11th, Veterans Day at the
Dab Lounge in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the address there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1532 North Circle, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds accurate to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are non-veterans invited as well as
veterans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but it is $50 to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that does is that goes to the
donation for my 501 to basically get the
[SPEAKER_02]: application, get the bylaws written,
get it rolling and going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I can actually do a whole lot more,
which is going to be the next three to
[SPEAKER_02]: five years is going to be something really
crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about that in a
minute, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Veteran Farmers Alliance event at the
Dab Lounge, make sure you guys come.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it's $50.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard of all of those companies that
donated products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the non-veterans that show up and pay
the $50 entry fee eligible for those
[SPEAKER_06]: raffles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I won two prizes last time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won a jar of weed and then my second
prize was a grinder.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't go any better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You walk in and win something,
you're happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got blazed out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a hoodie from our friend Fox.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a whole bunch of great things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned trying to raise money.
[SPEAKER_06]: The contributions will go to raise money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got so much going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like now I've got to get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's a what?
What?
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet will help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Legal Zoom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Legal Zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably going to be about,
I think, anywhere from 1,000 to 1,100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've got to go to score and then
they'll do all the help.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll help me with the bylaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that's gone, then I just want it to
all be legit for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody will make hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be like 22 grand top everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the rest of the donations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's once we have to establish people to
hire on to travel around and help put
[SPEAKER_02]: these events on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of doing two a year, we want to do
one every month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: In different locations to get more
veterans and more cities, more supplies to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow their own camp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we go national.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, if we take in, once we start
taking in a large amount and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I need to start hiring people to
start expanding, then their cap is 22
[SPEAKER_02]: grand, not 800 grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it modest for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're here to do it- Is this for the
Veteran Farmers Alliance or for the other
[SPEAKER_06]: organizations?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is just for Veteran Farmers
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point is if you're coming to
work, even me, I don't even know if I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to even take the money, but the
whole point is it's guys that need
[SPEAKER_02]: something to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take that donation instead of putting
it in our pocket, the whole non-profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is we'll take them out on
fishing trips, hunting trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take them out on backpacking trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take them down to Peru.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more therapeutic than any kind of
hospital visit or psychologist.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're having a friend to go hang out,
smoke some herbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually, you'll have your camp too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, we're going to get acreage
where we can just do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys can come out for a week and just
reset, hunt, fish, camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Veteran Farmers Alliance camping trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on our own land.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be private land.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come out and just relax,
just decompress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guys need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need a reset.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little quiet space away from the
fireworks.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this episode, it'll come out right
before the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys respect the veterans on the 4th
of July.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know that somebody that lives next
door or on your block is a combat veteran,
[SPEAKER_06]: go ask them if they're cool with
fireworks.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're not, don't lie to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go somewhere else and watch the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't freak people out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of stuff on Facebook about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please respect the veterans.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't agree with war, but these are
humans.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to respect them either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not, that shit sounds
exactly like it from a distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even up close, last year was the first
year I ever went to the 4th of July in
[SPEAKER_02]: eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, man, okay, I can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just reminded me a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, all right, yeah, that sounds
like it, but I know it's not real.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife's asking me every five and see,
okay, you okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last year about this time is when I
first started taking the steps to
[SPEAKER_02]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a quick process ever since then
too.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've known you basically through the whole
come through process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize you were that new or new
freshly out of your trauma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the word for it, but- You
know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got tired of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got tired of being in my head all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got tired of isolating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got tired of being this fucking asshole
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got to the point where I was like,
fuck me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to just do something about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife was going to leave me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to lose my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be trapped in my head
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found a good therapist, started doing
EMDR, and I started using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it's called.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to look it up the other day on Tok
Radio too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet Jay knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should message Jay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told our friend Jay Daly at TokRadio
.com, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hear this podcast every Wednesday
at 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: on Tok Radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are some cool guys up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jay's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten on his show in his studio
yet, but he runs my show on his network.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is super friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to go hang out with Jay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jay, if you're listening, invite me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to be on your show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to come and do your show and
Lucy's show on the same day and one trip
[SPEAKER_06]: to Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like hanging out with him at events,
giving him dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, he said do this hash on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: That hash over there, Jay said that this
was the best hash he's ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who grew the product?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who ran the extraction?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did the extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good work, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a dab of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: D-Wax, no gran.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I can't give you best I've
ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can remember one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: The very first secret cup in Denver,
entry number 23, Kyle Cushman's vegan
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best dabs I've ever, ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But shout out for Jay saying that this was
the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I still had that strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody wants that old school Kyle
Cushman cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very, very talented.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope one day I can be at that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're there, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on your way.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not there, you're on your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think I've got a few more years
under my belt.
[SPEAKER_06]: He presents it differently, but I'm sure
you've got all that in your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, well, combining our knowledge,
John's knowledge with mine, I think we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do some pretty cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've smoked a bunch of hash that this
guy's, that John has made and it is always
[SPEAKER_10]: quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always like somebody who enjoys my
products.
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoke a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen some boo-boo and I've seen gold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to take like half gram,
gram dabs or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try not to do it too much when I'm at
people's houses and in public.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just try to behave myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that definitely alters a person's
mind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Half gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like to go to the candy candy or
somewhere where there's a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_06]: and just walk in after work and just drop
a half gram dab on the email and people
[SPEAKER_06]: look at you like, but are you okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just got off work.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you didn't even cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, why would I cough?
[SPEAKER_06]: I just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do this all day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just got off work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you take a fat dab after work?
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a big fat joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't work, but.
[SPEAKER_06]: You work all day, but you do this and you
take care of veterans and maybe keeping
[SPEAKER_06]: your own head straight sometimes is plenty
of work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's video games too though.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a combat veteran with PTSD,
can you play combat style video games?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if my wife or kid come, I'm like,
go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of like, dude,
don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of like, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get off and I'm just like,
ugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing it does to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warrior mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it kind of like puts you back
into the mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, are you getting this or are you
like, kill a motherfucker, die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really good at it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I play BF3 on my PC, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not much of a gamer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had an issue with video games.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to give them up completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, when Sims was popular, I would show
up at work and my friends would be like,
[SPEAKER_06]: did you stay up all night playing the
Sims?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd be like, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You told me you care more about your Sims
than you do you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when I was like, eh,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're completely right right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to check this problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next time I moved, I got rid of all
my gaming consoles and I try really hard
[SPEAKER_06]: not to put games in my new computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets addicting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just replaced it with Instagram,
Facebook, Tinder, Twitter, Mass Roots,
[SPEAKER_06]: Green Door, Tumblr, Flickr.
[SPEAKER_06]: It became a little more proactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just switch.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll at least get you somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that real?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a bunch of likes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I can't hold them or do anything
with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I doubt like out of the however many
thousand people that follow me,
[SPEAKER_06]: I had like six of them would come to my
funeral.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, social media, man, it's a weird
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like I used to take all my time
and dedicate an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just it's it's like a one way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you post and you didn't really
get a whole lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could ask questions and get a
whole lot back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I moved over to Facebook and social
media was very awesome and very accepting
[SPEAKER_02]: over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been a blast meeting and just
getting to know a lot of just really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we became friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you I've been able to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, there's too many people to name off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan Lutz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan Wrights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan Wrights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan Wrights could be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys might hear some dogs in the
background, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met them at the door.
Scott.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I talked to him a lot on social
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Ostrander that owns Nectar for the
Guides.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, he's just he's awesome to talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so many good people on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there's a lot of drama,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see that's what the follow
buttons for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the block button or the block button.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm strong with a full block.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, doggy with the red, golden green
collar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dog is shy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dogs name is Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_09]: People with beards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so we were kind of in the middle of
talking about the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have a camp for these
veterans to go hang out and Medicaid and
[SPEAKER_06]: get away.
[SPEAKER_06]: We jumped off on fireworks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got a place for the veterans to go
get away and be away from everything and
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicaid properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hang out with other veterans and vent
and be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cannabis is free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's free.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
Everything.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, is there a limited number of seats or
how are you going to keep that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smell we got to get there first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Logistics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long term plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think once we get two years and what
we're doing now and we have the funds to
[SPEAKER_02]: really start looking, I think that's when
we'll start sitting down and really put
[SPEAKER_02]: shit on paper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I admire what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was the CEC?
[SPEAKER_06]: CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Veterans Collective.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, city council limits Colorado
Springs now and all of El Paso County on a
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 plant count limit, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you have a medical marijuana
card from a doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that upholdable in court?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it will.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to if you go up to like Denver
court.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up kitty on the show?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first cat.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my rag doll kitty.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's really nice, but she's loud as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys will hear a cat and dogs on this
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll lose in El Paso County.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll lose and you'll lose in the
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get bus in Colorado Springs,
you lose in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You lose in El Paso County until you got
to go up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you go to Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You win.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you've already spent your life
savings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've already taken everything away
from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, do they take it down when they bust
you now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do they let you go through court
before?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard them really, when I heard
them start doing raids, I just pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: cut everything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, OK, rooms done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm you know, I've had to cut down to
like an eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what you saw me smoke tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke, you know, eight grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that we used to be normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that the secret is concentrated.
[SPEAKER_06]: On this podcast, it wouldn't be a surprise
to smoke eight grams in an episode or when
[SPEAKER_06]: one day at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're way behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I had to cut it down to like maybe
maybe maybe two and a half grams a day
[SPEAKER_02]: just to not run out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my buddy called me because he knew I
was frustrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, man, you got to call this
other guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, he will tell you how to do it
and get into the industry where you can be
[SPEAKER_02]: legit 100 percent and you can operate to
where you can still help veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can help them in a way where you
couldn't do it before, which was I can
[SPEAKER_02]: recuperate the costs through my labor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also now I can re.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's what what's the word I would say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, I can resupply the VFA with
free cannabis donations from the CVC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're all in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're keeping everything in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all quality controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know exactly who grew it, where it's
coming from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the the CVC going to be regulated by
the Colorado MED?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we're looking for is basically
it's a place where we basically have a
[SPEAKER_10]: warehouse for your six plants,
because a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: cannot grow their plants, whether they can
and just can't in their living space or
[SPEAKER_10]: they don't have the green thumb to do so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or so are the time we are going to provide
a place for their six plants and we'll
[SPEAKER_10]: take care of it for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just like babysitting them and
have it giving them a place to grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we will return their product to
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all they have to do is reimburse us
for, you know, our time and our costs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And through that, we'll be able to help a
lot of people that would normally have to
[SPEAKER_10]: go to another recreational dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or to get an MED license or to get a red
card.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We operate according to Amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not operating in any gray or worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: What Amendment 64 says is what we are
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that, we're we're not sketchy at
all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Amendment 64, what it says
specifically is it lists out, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: personal uses of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can grow, you can store, you can
consume all of these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the last section in that part of
the amendment, it says that anyone in a
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado can assist you with any of the
things in this personal usage category.
[SPEAKER_10]: So therefore, you can have somebody
babysitting your plants for you because
[SPEAKER_10]: they are allowed to assist you in growing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve put his mic down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a way for us to be able to
provide a service that normally wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to be provided.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with this service being the way
it's going to be set up is now we can take
[SPEAKER_02]: in people like we're going to take in five
interns starting at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_02]: year for an entire year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to train five veterans up to
get into the industry, to learn how the
[SPEAKER_02]: process works through the MED,
buy their licenses, to get into the MED,
[SPEAKER_02]: get all that paperwork done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they're done after that year,
we bring in master growers like you or
[SPEAKER_02]: your boss or other bosses from different
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get to see stats and paperwork on
these guys, how consistent they were,
[SPEAKER_02]: what their testing, what the tests were on
their on their cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and basically you get to cherry pick
and you get to figure out who's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be your new grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to hire them on the spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're making kind of a master grower
farm league.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to train these guys to test.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a lot of these guys need a job or
something to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can train them as best we can and
get them into these positions to keep them
[SPEAKER_10]: busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in that way, we're helping the
community even more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll get to grow the plots for the
veterans that are giving you their plant
[SPEAKER_06]: counts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you guys are going to train them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to trust you guys as grow
skills.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're literally going to just
tether them to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to just take them down the
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and it's not, oh, this is just
it's in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is why we do it from personal
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: For reference, you know, like teaming with
microbes, teaming with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are good books for these guys to
read, not the the grow Bible when you got
[SPEAKER_02]: one that has like 600 pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're going to do it like
that, I mean, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd rather read something that's 200
pages and where you got to look up shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh, wow, that's really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you're actually learning and it's
proactive instead of comprehensive instead
[SPEAKER_06]: of an encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why it's green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, because it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be because you didn't I mean, it's like,
come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of growing knowledge is
just through experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're giving these guys experience and
knowledge for free and eventually a job,
[SPEAKER_10]: hopefully out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe one day across Colorado,
there'll be veterans running these grows
[SPEAKER_02]: or across the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we go federal, we're really waiting
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really just going to blow up with it
because now we're going to be the only
[SPEAKER_02]: training facility in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can train people and then send them
out anywhere in the United States after
[SPEAKER_02]: one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dogs think the buds smell great.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just got the seal of approval.
[SPEAKER_10]: The dog just walked up like Ziggy stole a
bunch of sunset sherbet off my tray the
[SPEAKER_10]: other day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're a bud thief.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a bad dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dog's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And veterans, they can just they can just
take control of the industry because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're some of the most disciplined,
hardworking people you'll ever meet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been through three people in the grow
facility so far that have not made the
[SPEAKER_06]: cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some veterans might be the next on
the shopping list.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm telling you, they're
dedicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need a purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You give you get veteran a purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll go a long way with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's loyal.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just he wants he wants to to be a part
of something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's great, then he's all about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there somebody on your guys's team that
knows how to build a good commercial size
[SPEAKER_06]: grow to keep everything that you're trying
to do sustainable?
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say between John and I,
we have it covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just auditioning is all,
you know, just trying to get some little
[SPEAKER_06]: gigs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve does had a level.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's ever already on the land that you
buy?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can make holes.
[SPEAKER_09]: The land is pretty much ready to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's waiting on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're waiting.
[SPEAKER_09]: His wife got cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the land.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a building for this collective.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's going that's going up here
pretty soon, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And engineers can already come out,
survey the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already ready to go like they can
literally dump the concrete tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the facility up within what,
six weeks after that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been working with Gavitas for a
while in this whole last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been focusing on grow room design
and, you know, maximizing yields through
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that after a year of focusing
on that, we can create the create the grow
[SPEAKER_10]: that we need to be able to provide
medicine for these guys at the cheapest
[SPEAKER_10]: cost possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to see the owners and founders
and CEOs of a grow be the people that are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be in there getting their hands
dirty because too often in the regulated
[SPEAKER_06]: industry, there are guys that own big
businesses that just want to make more
[SPEAKER_06]: money and they buy into the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the growers are forced to just
they have to face conditions and do
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to compromise their integrity
and grow often because the owner doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to spend the extra money to do it the
way it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not calling anybody out.
[SPEAKER_06]: My facility, I write a shopping list and
it's shows up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I write down a shopping list and take a
picture of it and send it to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next day when he comes in,
all that shit shows up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's like, you don't need to be
shopping and doing shit like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to John Hunt for all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that you go to the store for me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That helps me out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get those CO2 tanks filled.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're sitting in the room waiting for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But too many facilities have a lead guy
that is just throwing dollars at somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: that doesn't care about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to plenty of, I worked at a
facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I love that we agreed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was employed by one facility where all
of the upper management were snobs about
[SPEAKER_06]: hating potheads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they made fun of me because I was
high all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a weird environment to work in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because on my lunch break, I go in and
spend half my paycheck and then I go home
[SPEAKER_06]: and enjoy it and come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you shouldn't be mad at us
potheads.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making it rich, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We bought that new Hummer.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other part about this is none of this
is about making money.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all will have, you know, our,
you know, necessities taken care of and
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff, but nobody's going to get rich out
of this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like the only way this room
looks like they really want to be blingy
[SPEAKER_10]: rich.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like a bunch of humble dudes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just want to grow really good cannabis
and help people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go from A to B and be
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_06]: In almost any conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado vehicle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're going to, it's going to be
at least a 45 minute drive from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my house to the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just need something that's reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got most of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need something that's reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to grow cannabis for veterans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how long until this will realistically
be going the collective?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're thinking that we can get the guy to
move the damn building.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if that happens, we're thinking we'll
have our facility built in September,
[SPEAKER_10]: early mid September, mid late September,
mid late September, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: plants, first October in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: October is dropped in right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're waiting on a lawyer visit and buying
our business license for, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: our warehouse facility that we're
creating.
[SPEAKER_10]: And after that we wait, what was it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Six to eight weeks for that license.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we can start signing people up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once we have the tax license and all that,
we're ready to rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do already have a website.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get up at coloradoveteranscollective.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coloradoveteranscollective.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys support that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put a bunch of clicks on their website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Share it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a veteran friend, a family
member, if you're a veteran, share that
[SPEAKER_06]: with other veterans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a veteran, you should be friends
with Steve Dufino on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: He likes veterans of all shapes and ages.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually I have a like page is a
veteran farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys don't stalk us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's personal Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't really know you, I don't
usually add you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of weird requests lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been getting a lot of weird stuff too
lately, so I've just been a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: locked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it's gotta be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go on Facebook, veteran farmers
Alliance on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can go to contact us on our
website at the CVC's website and it will
[SPEAKER_10]: email one of us and we can get back to you
as quick as we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you do contact them, let them
know that you heard about them through the
[SPEAKER_06]: grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we would all like to know,
we like to know where the resources came
[SPEAKER_06]: from and where things went and who heard
what.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a good way to trace things
back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they'll know where the
relationship developed and then they'll
[SPEAKER_06]: treat you like a VIP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they'll take good care of you no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was always super kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: You, I don't know about rough.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the dark one here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You kind of, I could kind of read that,
but you saved the day by fixing the SD
[SPEAKER_06]: card.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to give you some tips on
how to fix your computer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got good core in me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it an Intel?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Computer joke, computer joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is a computer guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He told me he'll rip your computer apart
and put it back together in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get a free pizza if it's not ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: No,
[SPEAKER_09]: there are problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so basically to, to keep our costs
low.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the CVC, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep our costs low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pass this over to John
because he's going to read off some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: main sponsors that have helped us for the
CVC.
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are for the CVC to get you guys
started with your facility and the
[SPEAKER_10]: building and the land.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's hear it from these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our first sponsor and the one that makes
this incredibly possible for us to do and
[SPEAKER_10]: cheap for the veterans is Nectar for the
Gods.
[SPEAKER_10]: Steve has been growing with Nectar for the
Gods for a few years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like two years now and he's gotten to
know the owner really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got us joined too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's been sponsored for a while by
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we went to him with this idea that we
had and Steve emailed him or Facebooked
[SPEAKER_10]: him and asked if he would continue the
sponsorship and he agreed with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we are getting our nutrients and
soil for free, which helps us keep the
[SPEAKER_10]: cost down for the veterans.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reimbursement fee is planned to be at
a hundred dollars at first.
[SPEAKER_10]: And remember this is recreational at a
hundred dollars first.
[SPEAKER_10]: And every sponsorship we get, we can take
that chunk out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our goal is $50 reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause as our costs drop, so do the prices.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're not in a ghetto, but I do
hear fireworks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are fireworks and not gunshots.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were at my house, it would be
questionable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our old house as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought Pueblo was bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado Springs is getting there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I've had some interesting neighbors.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some seed sponsors.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Gonzo seeds, uh, given us the
genetics we need.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, obviously we've been on toke radio on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, they enjoyed our time up there and we
will probably be going back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those guys are really awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, they're going to have our,
uh, commercials run on their radio show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we got pollination.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Steve knows Ryan.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're, they have some killer
strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they're going to be sending us some
of their genetics to work with,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, CB one analytics.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Steve got in contact with those guys
and Tuesday and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_10]: running all of our, uh, all of our testing
for us for free as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can know exactly what we're giving
these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys will have some irie genetics in
that garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some high yielding stuff that you
guys will appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the list we have so far,
but even with just those, we're able to
[SPEAKER_10]: keep the cost down as best we can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, everything else that we can add on
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will just be cutting off and making it
cheaper for these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time we can chop at that price to
bring it down, it's just a better
[SPEAKER_06]: advantage for these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I were a veteran and I signed my
plants over to you and then I wait
[SPEAKER_06]: probably 60 or 90 days so that you could
pull my plants down and get a harvest out
[SPEAKER_06]: of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, for a hundred dollars to start,
what realistically, what amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine can I expect from you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess it depends on the size of
the plants we grow, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're thinking three gallons, three to
five gallon plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And six of them, because that's your
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, three, three in flower, three,
three plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, and we'll keep it on a pretty
nice rotation for everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything will be numbered by page.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everything like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll be able to keep it constant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, of course, you know, the better
we grow, the more we'll come out of each
[SPEAKER_10]: plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so eventually they'll be getting
potentially more than they can actually
[SPEAKER_10]: consume.
[SPEAKER_10]: And at that point there, they can waive
their cost and give their product back to
[SPEAKER_10]: us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where we're going to be able to
start giving away free product through to
[SPEAKER_10]: the VFA.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that chain of command that's
working really well for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no loose ends where money or
anything just sits around.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're always just trying to give back as
good, as fast as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like, you know, city council,
when they did the whole 12 plant count,
[SPEAKER_02]: it really just broke me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just, I was really upset and I
was like, man, there's gotta be a way
[SPEAKER_02]: around this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was such a ridiculous way to do
it because nobody at that meeting,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, we've been over this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody at that meeting wanted that to go
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no one, not, not one person.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was four people that wanted it to go
through, plus the, the, the city council
[SPEAKER_02]: members.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was about 150 to 200 that were
opposed to that measure pass.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was so many people there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched that on the internet and you
could even feel the vibe of the room
[SPEAKER_10]: coming from the computer screen as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I live in another city and I was still
paying attention because you guys had me
[SPEAKER_06]: rallied.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was four hours of testimony.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 13 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Andrew's part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you said that there was another bill
coming up that you wanted to talk about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently, uh, somebody's gathered
enough signatures to possibly add this to
[SPEAKER_02]: the ballot for this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's to limit the percentage of THC in
every single product, whether it's medical
[SPEAKER_02]: or recreational, that's 16%.
[SPEAKER_06]: 16% THC in anything, everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Concentrates flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_06]: How I would have to get rid of every
flower in my garden or cut it down at week
[SPEAKER_06]: five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the hell wants to smoke week five weed
that doesn't even smoke?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that mean that this slab of shatter
could only test at 16% THC?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pointless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be, I could be a little off,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm pretty sure you're correct with
the flower because I've read this
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it's, if from what I heard last
night, it was everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the point, whether it's
recreation or medical, who the hell is
[SPEAKER_02]: that going to benefit?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no longer medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to destroy dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to destroy everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what happens if you test over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to just throw it away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to just destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that to happen, I mean,
that's just, man, that's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a quitter, but if you told me that
I couldn't grow cannabis over 16% THC
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore, I might quit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'd move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to move the operation
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to really, I mean,
terpenes are great, but they only take,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and THC is great, but there's the
combination of both in high forms that are
[SPEAKER_02]: just truly beneficial.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the perfect medicine right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Missing either one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just going to be, you know,
synthesized THC or it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: blocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the reasoning behind this
idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ignorance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ignorance is the answer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody trying to control the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: That can't go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I think it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think they make so much money
in the black market, like busting people
[SPEAKER_02]: in the black market that they're trying to
revert it back a little bit so they can
[SPEAKER_02]: just keep going after it and just keep
nailing that each nail into the coffin
[SPEAKER_02]: just to make it worse, to make us
criminals again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of like, I'm flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you gave us this and now you
want to take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they like gave it all to us too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're taking it away piece by piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't that kind of what the
government's been lately?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, here, take this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just made it illegal in a different
twist with the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't grow at home because you are
just going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you can't buy good weed at
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So go home and grow your good weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that's a no, no.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can drink and pop all your pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just hate to go back to all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people do you see when you're out
in Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people do you see that are just
too high for their own good on cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: that are causing a problem?
[SPEAKER_06]: None.
[SPEAKER_06]: None.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of meth heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't trying to go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many people do you see on a
bicycle as soon as the sun goes down with
[SPEAKER_06]: a fucking headlamp on their forehead,
picking at a sword, driving around,
[SPEAKER_06]: peeking at every trash can?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to dodge them on your car right
now because you got to throw something
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll sell this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stoners aren't the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that are the problem are less
than one percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going after them and then
punishing the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Making an example out of that one asshole
that wasn't even part of the crew that we
[SPEAKER_06]: would have we would have shunned him and
punished him anyway if we saw his actions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want that in our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want that in our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be able to support our
community and be able to show people that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're in this for the good reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these regulations just trying to tie
us down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, there's there is too many
plants in a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it's too powerful for the grid,
it'll burn the grid up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get a house fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's people that need 40,
50, 60 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's perfectly acceptable in a home.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and you can do that safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no reason you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, especially with kids that like
parents, there's one lady that has 19
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains for her child.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she can't she loses those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like she's screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kid needs that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's it's pretty powerful to
be able to provide something like that for
[SPEAKER_02]: a child in your own home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody tries to say,
no, it's like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to the store.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's missing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mass produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like your own house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the price of I don't exactly know what
a gram costs to produce at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done math and it's come out somewhere
between 50 cents and two bucks a gram,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, to produce cannabis at home,
just depending on what kind of nutrients
[SPEAKER_06]: and what your electrical happens to be
where you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard as low as 30 cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: What dispensary can you find anything for
30 cents?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably cheaper than that at my
house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ten or twelve dollars a gram at a
dispensary minimum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus getting there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus we'll look at recreational tax,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And who knows what was sprayed on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows what kind of nutrients it was
grown with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just everything it tested for for
it was a pyrethium, I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of the recreational products are
currently tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: July 1st was supposed to be the day I was
going to do another show about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: July 1st was supposed to be the day when
all of the medical products were tested,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they've pushed it back to later in the
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be closer to September or
October before they're able to test
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got to get all their sprayed
weed through first.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have enough facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't regulated enough testing
facilities to do all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they implement that, there's just
going to be pounds sitting there and all
[SPEAKER_06]: the shelves are going to go bare because
nobody can test the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's like, why aren't we focusing on
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we going after less than one
percent and punishing everybody else when
[SPEAKER_02]: we could be going about the regulation and
just setting the standard and making a
[SPEAKER_02]: good presentation for the rest of the
nation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think if we had eight or 12 good
solid standardized testing facilities that
[SPEAKER_06]: were bringing in an excise tax every time
that product got tested, do you think they
[SPEAKER_06]: would replace the revenues that they're
making off of busting petty weed crimes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would definitely look better.
It would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we just need some sort of
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will start to accept it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my wife, three and a half,
four years ago, she was like, no weed in
[SPEAKER_02]: my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now she's like, well, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: She bleeds it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She hates the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's actually allergic to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: She tries really hard to like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she does a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a good supporter of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an awesome person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just saved me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you probably should probably our
relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to keep being an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, saved our money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been able to go shopping
again and get food on the table again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I started growing for myself,
it was like, wow, I wasn't spending $2,700
[SPEAKER_02]: to $3,000 a month at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many prescriptions were you able to
eliminate using cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 24?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bigger than you thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I don't mean to laugh at that,
but 24 different prescriptions were
[SPEAKER_06]: replaced with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're having a shitty week and
you're not feeling your best and need
[SPEAKER_06]: extra medicine, how much are you going to
smoke in a whole week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe an ounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so somewhere between 150 and 200 bucks
worth of quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you grew it yourself, we're looking
at 28 grams, maybe 28 bucks worth of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe $10.
[SPEAKER_06]: $10 worth of.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's pretty much sponsored for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the nutrients are paid for and you get
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay water and lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your energy, your I mean, your effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but I don't really know what I
include.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it's it's to me, it's like
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I do it for the joy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the the growing of it is
therapeutic for you also.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been lined up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You smile more than anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go into his room with him and it's just
details here and there shows you every
[SPEAKER_10]: single plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely part of the healing
process.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's another reason why we want to
bring these guys in, because it will work
[SPEAKER_10]: for other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I feel calm in my garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to drive 55 miles from my house to
the office every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last 10 miles of that drive is
like bumper to bumper madness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could probably park my car or run up to
the guy in front of me and punch him in
[SPEAKER_06]: the face six times and get back in my car
before traffic even moved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time I get in the grow,
it's just like, yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Green, beautiful plants, a bunch of fans.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's 74 degrees and I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: 74, 77 ish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, glorious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to get it down to like 72 in the
last two and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I wasn't running a big perpetual,
I would do things a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: But with a perpetual, you have to keep it
ideal across the board.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've got, there are plants every
three weeks, there are new plants going
[SPEAKER_06]: in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got stuff at week one,
week three, and week six, or week nine,
[SPEAKER_06]: six, and three.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to have 1212 and 74 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1212?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been playing with light
manipulation lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did it 35 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I flipped into 1113.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the last one at 15 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did one at just straight 1113.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to see how, if anything,
any flavor changes, or anything's
[SPEAKER_02]: enhanced, or if anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I noticed from the 1113 was when I
was doing phenohunts, I would see much
[SPEAKER_06]: more phenotypical expression with the
extended dark period.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would see much more variation from
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for a breeder, that was really handy.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did notice was it kind of
diminished on my harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: My yield wasn't where it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seemed to finish a little quicker,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: They finished quicker, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually gotten a bump in weight from
switching over to 1113.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might have been that mammoth microbes
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's been both.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You said you wanted to give a shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a beautiful time to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth microbes has been huge for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That product, it has made some of the
densest, stickiest nugs I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it MED approved?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we use it in the MED grows?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a lot of products are banned.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of shit is banned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Should be legit then.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll compare it to the other things that I
use.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't talk about one of the products
that I use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our secrets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a proprietary thing,
but we also use the Veg Bloom Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll compare it to that and see if it's
got the same stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't pee on your plants, do you?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you hear me say that?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the secret, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually told people to pee on their
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you make your plants like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pee on them every morning,
drink six Guinnesses, go to bed,
[SPEAKER_06]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes it expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbes travel through.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so disgusting with that dark,
thick, frothy piss around your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not piss on your plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might work out first, but maybe for a
short while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a Guinness in like eight years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to think about that.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mammoth microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve's got to go refill his water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, we've been going for almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, you're just talking to folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were already going for a while before
too, just talking here without talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to spend 30 minutes getting my SD
card fixed because for some reason it
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't want to work when I showed up to
record, which was almost embarrassing,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's electronics, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That just happens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just put it in the case and carried it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like since Steve left, we're all
stuck at a lull because he's got a
[SPEAKER_06]: notebook over there and he was kind of
running the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Steve's definitely the talker.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a people person.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're good at growing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to grow soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Soil, hydro, cocoa.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_10]: The Nectar Number 8 Soil is the one we
like.
[SPEAKER_10]: We add a little extra perlite and it's
cocoa based.
[SPEAKER_10]: Their whole line is just all the organic
things I would use in my soil,
[SPEAKER_10]: but in bottles and pHed low so that it
doesn't go bad and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: That stuff works great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Half the time, me and Steve can't even
tell the difference between our weeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have different overtones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm very impressed with the Nectar
Frilly with God's Line and I'm an organics
[SPEAKER_10]: guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like any lines, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a friend named Sean who's been on
the podcast a lot of times who doesn't use
[SPEAKER_06]: any bottles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing he's using comes from a bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: His product is definitely, you can tell
that it's a different product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cleaner, it burns better,
though ashes are as white as his parchment
[SPEAKER_06]: paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fish bone meal is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's all about fish and he's got the fish
bone meal bottle and it's just fish bone
[SPEAKER_10]: meal diluted into water.
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that stuff's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve got me inspired.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went and got a beverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reaching for one out of the backpack
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this Dr. Pepper that's in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a frosty cold Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You came prepared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you got to come prepared to the
podcast when you have no idea where you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dog on the podcast.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got anything to say, dog?
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of food are we eating lately,
bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Speak.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the dog like cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been trim cycle and we just give the
dogs the leaves, the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, they're not getting high off
of it or anything, but those vitamins and
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff, they know it's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Phytonutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: They eat the leaves off and leave the stem
and they'll nibble around the stem and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're just like, oh, we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, they'll clean our floors
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the brother of this dog too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, neat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the black one is the mom.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this, this gold one over here
came out of her and Steve got one of the
[SPEAKER_10]: all black ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: And breeding dogs was an experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like breeding plants way more.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my mind went somewhere really weird
with that because it's much easier to get
[SPEAKER_06]: rid of ugly plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: This puppy is non-desirable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really do what you do with the
plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it's frowned upon a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the biggest smile he's had the
whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know anything about dogs that went
missing.
[SPEAKER_06]: One bag full of puppies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: The show just got really weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about vitamins and farming
cannabis some more because this podcast,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at the dates.
[SPEAKER_06]: This podcast, ironically, I did not plan
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to come out on the 4th of
July.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfectly timed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holiday podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are listening, I hope you're,
uh, don't drive drunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're on the boat, don't boat drunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're at a state park celebrating
today, be careful with your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're listening after the 4th of
July, cause most people are going to wait
[SPEAKER_06]: until Tuesday to listen to this since
Monday's a holiday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you made it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope everything went your way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: If things didn't, I'm fucking sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not light any mortar shells off your
chest or head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking like you've done this
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was in the news last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was two deaths we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: People died from fireworks?
[SPEAKER_02]: One, one decided to light off one of those
big mortars off his chest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess, and it just went right
through his chest and out his back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one dude tried to hold his head,
blew his head apart.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chasing those likes on YouTube or views on
YouTube.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill yourself for a few likes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that worked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't burn down any state parks or any
of our beautiful fires.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't do that stupidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn some joints down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Burn a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But be careful wherever you are,
wherever you're doing it, burn some
[SPEAKER_06]: joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, cannabis may be legal in Colorado,
but there's no legal place to consume it
[SPEAKER_06]: other than your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that all about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's kind of, it's stupid,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can smoke it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here in the Springs, we have great open
parks where people love to go and smoke
[SPEAKER_10]: down, but you know, if there's for some
reason there's a cop up there,
[SPEAKER_10]: they'll get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not bothering anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I'm a father and I don't want to be
walking through the park with my daughter,
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoying ice cream and have to explain to
her what you guys are doing when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: out there taking days.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not, that's not your guys'
conversation to introduce to my daughter's
[SPEAKER_06]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mine to bring up when the time is
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of thanks for being there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we can have that talk is my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everyone wants their three year old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a 13 year old, so it's plenty
time past time to have a weed talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about weed a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's, oh my God, dad, that weed stinks so
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about it with my seven year
old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, once she was about four,
it was like, okay, look, I want to educate
[SPEAKER_02]: you on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She knows not to touch it, not to get
close to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She stays completely away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she just knows she's been
educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has no desire for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She knows it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, whoa, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't, I just, I just don't want
anybody to have to have the talk of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that smell?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that hippie guy doing over there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dad, he's doing drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just going to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't want to do that to our scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should respect those parks a little
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a hypocrite cause I took a dab at
the park the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nowhere to dab and I live an hour
away from here and my friend was nice
[SPEAKER_06]: enough to bring me lunch and I thought she
deserves some dabs for bringing me lunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, well, let's go to that park
right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's why we need our dab lounges
around.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Springs said no to those too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss being able to go to one.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite places to ever go in
Springs was to go hang out at the Canna
[SPEAKER_06]: Canyon.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first time Steve and I met.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was recording a podcast at the Canyon
and posted that I was there and he showed
[SPEAKER_06]: up and brought weed for me to try.
[SPEAKER_09]: Arguably if it is truly regulated,
like alcohol, he should be able to consume
[SPEAKER_09]: in a public place, like a bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the most valid argument out of all
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You tried to, the officials, the
legislation is the one that made it
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was their idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Regulate it like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an alcohol drinking establishment
on every two blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in Pueblo, there's one every 30
feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's terrible in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many drinking places and nowhere legal
to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for in your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's if you have permission from
your landlord, if you rent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how am I supposed to medicate safely
on a lunch break if I don't live here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well you shouldn't be medicating
anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't rely on showing up at your house
every day at Canna.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Steve, can I sit on your couch for 20
minutes, take four dabs and get out of
[SPEAKER_06]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends on how good of friends we
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of guys if they come
through into the Springs, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, come on through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to battle?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the cattleman fell off the box.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw some commotion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were going to battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that cat is awkward.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right you guys, we've been going for
about an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of my listeners check out about an
hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate all three of you being
on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything that you want to
include in the show before we start
[SPEAKER_06]: wrapping up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just nothing really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talked about everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we covered a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keep your eyes and ears open for the
Colorado Veterans Collective.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be starting in about two,
three months.
[SPEAKER_10]: And follow us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go visit our website.
[SPEAKER_10]: Send us an email.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once that's started, there will be
great things in the work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys, you don't have to wait until
all of their new stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a veteran and you need support,
you need help in any way, cannabis related
[SPEAKER_06]: or not, reach out to Steve DeFino.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reach out to the Veteran Farmers Alliance
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can email me,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will put you in touch with Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need something and you're a
veteran, we will help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need something and you're not a
veteran, we will help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're compassionate folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to put smiles on people's faces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep everybody in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need some immediate help,
if you need someone to talk to,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever, you're a veteran, reach out to
us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're your friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening to this, we're your
friend already.
[SPEAKER_06]: So reach out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those listening, happy 4th of July
from Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great way to wrap this
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quinton, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this your first podcast?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_06]: You saved the fucking show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve, we're going to have you back lots
of times, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime you've got something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let's pitch the event one more time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind the people when and where.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's November 11th at the Dab Lounge
at 1532 North Shore.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a long ways away, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have Steve remind us a couple of
times before that comes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like five months away and we all
consume a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're gathering a lot of donations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even John here is going to be donating a
half pound of his own personal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of my medical girl.
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to bring a half pound, roll some
joints for these guys, give it away.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to take any back at the end.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come home with nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We give it all away.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the VFA.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working on it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the rushed breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to hurry up and push it out
just because it's in demand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to breed the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when they're ready, you guys will
get them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would love to carry your product and
get them out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys will have exclusive shit that no
one else has.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make something for you that's named
after something you need or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: John, was this your first podcast,
bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was on Tok Radio with Steve the
other day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome time and had a great time this
time too.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a great podcaster.
[SPEAKER_10]: You do well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a public speaker, so I guess this
isn't going to work though.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just some friends talking right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I guess is a good time to tell you
that this podcast, within 48 hours of
[SPEAKER_06]: being published, 5,000 people will have
downloaded and listened to this podcast.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm glad I didn't tell you that
before.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad they listened to us.
Babylon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They love to hear us.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it when we ramble, is a hashtag
that's been created for the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: We swept a lot of bowls before this,
so it rarely happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I show up, there's dabbing.

[SPEAKER_06]: welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for episode number 142 of The
Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_06]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_06]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you once again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: As always, I need to give a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_06]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got through it without coughing,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I deserve an award.
[SPEAKER_06]: Impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, I was trying to go fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: This episode is the 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to come out on Sunday,
710.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 710, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you got the e-nail turned on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you got the dabber going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you got a quartz banger heated up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you got that highly educated titanium
quartz combo going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you got an elevate rig with a fat
nail on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're smoking some super good
shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're a spoiled bitch like I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're over there smoking some of
those fresh OG Kush turps from our friends
[SPEAKER_06]: at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, on the show with me
today, celebrating 710 is White Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I am DTFO.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a little pre-game over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still got the cough going a little bit,
folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the throat thing where you got to
act like you're not going to cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to keep convincing yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm going to cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're taking dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tweet me, tell me what you're dabbing at
GFYH Podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know what you're taking dabs of
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it live resin?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it shatter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it poop soup?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it tain batter?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you got going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it some of those Evo Labs fresh turps?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some of these fresh
turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, I keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not a lot of people in the world
know what the hell I'm even talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got fancier, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have stepped up our game here in
Colorado, our friends at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said we, like I'm involved in this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my role in this party.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do a little product research for these
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be your space monkey.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: They take some shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: They take hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're taking CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 90% sure that this is made with CO2
oil, a CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of people right now in
the industry playing with refining CO2 oil
[SPEAKER_05]: in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this seems to be my favorite way.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a fractal distillation process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Home run I've gotten to play with.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the clear, they're calling it
distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the distillate is done with a
fractal distillation process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're separating basically
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cannabinoids, the turpinoids and the
lipids are all pulled apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this container right here is a
container of nothing but the THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 90%, 90.94% THC and 1.1% CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is raw distillate from Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to open the jar here and try to
describe what's in this container the best
[SPEAKER_06]: I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like really runny honey or super
clear olive oil, maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's got more of the consistency of
like honey or maple syrup a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little thicker than any olive oil
I've ever seen, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The color might be right though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks like, I don't know,
it's like honey almost in there,
[SPEAKER_06]: but this doesn't have much flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is just raw distillate THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just super potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super stupid potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put a little bit of this on the dabber
and this is where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take that little bit that's on the
dabber and I dunk that into the Ghost
[SPEAKER_06]: Train Haze Raw Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is mostly turpinoids with a little
bit of cannabinoids, like one or 2% THC in
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I a dick if I call it the adult version
of Fun Dips?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is definitely, well, I'm a deadhead
and we've got our own little version of
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun Dips, but this is the weed world of a
Fun Dip.
Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you take that beautiful 90% THC
distillate and then you dunk it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You dunk it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the glorious part is in my other hand,
I've got some OG Kush Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can either dunk it in my OG Kush
Terps or I can dunk it over here in my
[SPEAKER_06]: Ghost Train Haze Terps, or I could dunk it
in one and then I could dunk it in the
[SPEAKER_06]: other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're changing up the flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: The OG Kush Terps, if you put it on this
distillate and dab it, it tastes like you,
[SPEAKER_06]: if apples tasted like OG Kush and you bit
into an OG Kush apple, it was just OG Kush
[SPEAKER_06]: all in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could almost chew the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how much OG Kush flavor these Terps
put in your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor content's really, really nice
this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the high from the distillate
comboed with, I really like the high that
[SPEAKER_06]: I get from the Ghost Train Haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sativa dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talk about this every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other stuff that's in it, the THC is
definitely a big part of the high,
[SPEAKER_05]: but everything else that's in it really
plays with that THC in some fun ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost never go for the most potent on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think about the rest of your
life, you typically don't do that either.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to get that other component to
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this way, you can get both.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get insanely potent and really,
really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been kind of being a snobby bitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take some of this Blue Sherb 120 Micron
fresh frozen solventless hash,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I roll out a little patty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I dunk some Durbin poison shatter
onto it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I rub the little cactus cooler
live resin on top of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I put a little bit of the Terps on
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I put some of that 90% THC
distillate on top of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took a big ass dab of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember in high school when you used to
go park somewhere and see how high you
[SPEAKER_06]: could get?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we got that high is when I
took that big ass dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: My arm hair was wiggling around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was visibly waving like a flag.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing something similar with
just much, much cheaper products.
[SPEAKER_05]: With just your typical wax or shatter,
I'll take a piece of shatter and kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: pancake it out real far, throw a little
wax in the middle, roll up a little
[SPEAKER_05]: taquito, and dab that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But mine are much smaller and much less
fancy than the ones you've been throwing
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to go big or go home when I take
dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go little and go often.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go big and go often.
[SPEAKER_05]: Best of both worlds, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the best parts about taking
dabs is that you can grab the dabber and
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike can take his dosage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's a cigarette smoker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you get Mike worked up a little
bit, you can hear him gurgle.
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't even need dabs to start making
funky lung butter noises.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like the bong occasionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I give Mike, if you handed me the dabs
that I gave Mike, I would laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say, can you maybe triple,
quadruple that up?
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mike takes just little pin sides dabs,
probably the dabs you take.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike takes that size of a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he will cough and turn purple and get
sweaty.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the e-nail carb cap set up as smooth
as it is over here, I cough like a beast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not nearly as bad as home because I
don't have that carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cap adds quite a bit, people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get yourself a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's educate folks on the e-nail right
quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: The electronic continuously heated nail is
a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also a little dangerous, depending on
where you dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one in the car for 710.
[SPEAKER_05]: The space I dab often is also shared by
three large dogs that are really furry and
[SPEAKER_05]: fluffy and psychotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was going to add an e-nail to that
mix, something would get set on fire that
[SPEAKER_05]: I care about.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's kind of a reason I don't have one
yet, but it's on the short list of things
[SPEAKER_05]: to treat myself to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to take mine out of the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was getting careless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was getting too high in the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'm pretty, pretty medicated
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to chill out on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also I had to set the rig in the
cup holder and I forgot it was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I felt warmth a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that I was going to burn
myself, but I was like, Ooh, that is warm
[SPEAKER_06]: over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had to think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, I'm kind of close to
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I took the e-nail out of the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you what to do, but if
there's somebody in the back seat that
[SPEAKER_06]: needs to have their medical cannabis
available while you're driving,
[SPEAKER_06]: they can consume their medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're an adult.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the e-nail, there's a box on my table.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's six inches long, four inches tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's smaller than the original Nintendo,
but a little taller.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got a display on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little led display with the number.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a power switch on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the coolest fucking features.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a USB port.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike is charging his phone right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much every episode that I've been
on in the last six months, my phone's been
[SPEAKER_05]: charging on that USB slot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a really beautiful feature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my friend Giddy up at
Emotech.
[SPEAKER_06]: This e-nail was actually a gift from Giddy
up at Emotech.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a big shout out and shout out to
Margulies for the replacement coils.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so there's this box with an led screen
on the front with numbers displayed on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And coming out of that box is another
cord.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a silver cord.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a silver braided cord.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it goes to where the dab nail is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes up to your nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're using any sort of nail setup,
instead of the little nail that sits
[SPEAKER_05]: inside the rig in the dome or a titanium
domeless, we've got a much larger titanium
[SPEAKER_05]: domeless that has this coil leading to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's tightly wrapped around the
nail so that it can evenly heat that
[SPEAKER_05]: surface to whatever temperature we feel
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where I want to jump in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody talks about what temperature
is your e-nail set to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not believe that that number right
there, where it says 717 right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not at all a temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's a temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it correlates to the actual
temperature on my nail surface,
[SPEAKER_06]: because I think this box would cost much
more money for it to actually have a
[SPEAKER_06]: thermostat inside it that's doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our friends that is the guy that
works on my website actually told me
[SPEAKER_06]: that's actually a frequency.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've always understood it to
be, is just the random frequency that it
[SPEAKER_05]: kicks out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus it gives you something to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like your speakers.
[SPEAKER_05]: 11 doesn't fucking mean anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know that in my car- It means
something to you in relation to how loud
it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that in my car 23 is like the prime
spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I go up to 26, it gets a little,
and you don't want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerry starts sounding a little extra
heroin-y if you turn them up too loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've posted pictures before us getting
ready to record stuff, and somebody always
[SPEAKER_05]: chimes in and is like, dude, your e-nail
is like 300 degrees too hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, that's not a temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always like the first three replies
that I have to put out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure if you bought seven EmoTech
units, they'd all be close to the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a couple that have the
temperature display, and I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one TaskRock made, the original,
and we're going to talk about TaskRock.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, this is the fucking 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: You best believe we're going to talk about
our boy TaskRock.
[SPEAKER_06]: The original e-nail, that TaskRock of
highly educated, the innovator,
[SPEAKER_06]: the originator, that original e-nail did,
I think, that temperature did correlate to
[SPEAKER_06]: the one on the box, although I'm not
certain, but I'm pretty sure it did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Big D with the original.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got the museum version.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got the first e-nail that Task made.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on Daniel's shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love and respect to Big D.
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope to see you soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good old days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really don't think that that number
correlates.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think like Mike said- That's definitely
not a temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get in your car or whatever,
where you like it, where you really like
[SPEAKER_06]: to jam out, when your favorite song comes
on, when Born To Be Wild comes on,
[SPEAKER_06]: or you want to drive on the freeway way
too fast, whatever, like 23, 39,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever it is in your car stereo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's not 23 decibels.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a random number they picked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had something for you to think about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medium high right before it starts
crackling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to think my dad's kind of hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the e-nail a little hotter than
most people.
[SPEAKER_06]: When Spence would come over, shout out to
Spencer from the Garden of Weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would immediately turn it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wouldn't even ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd be like, you don't nail too hot,
dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't say dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would call me the N word.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're nailed too high, N word.
[SPEAKER_06]: And reach over and just turn my shit down
like it was his.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wouldn't argue, because that's
Spencer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he made the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about to dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just going to let him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he would always turn it the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd be like, my esophagus.
[SPEAKER_06]: It always says it's esophagus.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he turned that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take pretty low tab dabs at home every
now and then.
[SPEAKER_05]: I undershoot it, or I sneeze between
heating the nail with the torch and going
[SPEAKER_05]: to dab, and then find it's a little too
cold and I puddle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to overheat it at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even overheating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just hot enough to cook all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I'm sucking four dabs through
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the skillet days?
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day, bro, we used to go way
hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until that skillet glows like the sun,
you keep heating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the remaining members of the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Phil Lesh doesn't tour anymore,
so they call themselves Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Dead and Co in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to my friend that took me to
that show.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I saw the Dead in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some kids taking dabs in the
back of this SUV.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the tailgate up and they had the
dab rig sitting up on a little thing so
[SPEAKER_06]: that all they had to do was put it to
their face.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the dude heats it with the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just walking toward this car,
walking through rows, walking through the
[SPEAKER_06]: parking lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see him just... And I was like,
it's hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can fucking stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to turn that nail into
fucking water right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't say anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was none of my business.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, he's going to put the dome
on or whatever and let it cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw the dome on and fucking put that
dabber to that nail while it was glowing
[SPEAKER_06]: bright orange.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just cringed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not my place to say anything,
but my heart just tingled.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh God, that poor fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only are you ruining yourself for no
reason, you're also losing so much of the
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're burning up the turps, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're burning the turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: The downside is if you undershoot it,
you end up just wasting your hash on the
[SPEAKER_05]: nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It puddles instead of vaporizes and that's
sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I hit the e-nail, when I'm taking a
big fat dab, a lot of times, you guys,
[SPEAKER_06]: I come home from work and I want to dab
like a half gram, maybe a gram of hash in
[SPEAKER_06]: one fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are more people in this room.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll raise their hands and fucking
testify.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross and Jeff will pull a gram dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got hands up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Testify.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like to take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will do that on the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times when I'm smoking these
turps in the distillate, I bust out this
[SPEAKER_06]: one right here, my Elevate Klein Cycler
with the little banger on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a, they say it's quartz.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you money.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a little glass banger on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my flavor saver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it tastes a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think quartz versus Thai.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think sometimes got to say that the
quartz tastes a little bit better in my
[SPEAKER_06]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that on my short list of things I
want to treat myself with is an ice quartz
[SPEAKER_05]: banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really dig this one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the highly educated titanium base
with the quartz dish on top.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw some of that on Instagram and didn't
let myself look because I was doing car
[SPEAKER_05]: repairs at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: For a guy like myself that likes to travel
with a little rig like that, that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause this banger, the way that I travel
with it, that would get destroyed quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, where my dab rig sits most of the
time, that would be safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I can't risk the e-nail right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I could risk the bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: The puppy could take the bucket,
but not the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's safer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the cord that's the problem on the
e-nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just in practice, I know my household
well enough to me to know that that rig
[SPEAKER_05]: would get yanked off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That cord is dangerous at this table.
[SPEAKER_06]: That cord is knocked over and broken this
exact rig once before just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just wobbled and spun itself over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause the, you guys, the cord on this
e-nail was coiled in a box for a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: years it looks like and shipped from
fucking China and vacuumed packed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's going to be coily shaped for
the rest of his life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes you try to straighten it out
and it makes you think it went straight,
[SPEAKER_06]: but then it just starts coiling slowly and
wind itself up and tip your rig over.
[SPEAKER_06]: So turn your e-nail off when you leave the
house.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a reminder to myself also,
you know, I have no idea how many times
[SPEAKER_06]: I've come home and been like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never leave the house with an active heat
source running like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a basic human.
[SPEAKER_06]: Low tip is better when I'm doing a small
dab is what I wanted to kind of take that
[SPEAKER_06]: e-nail versus the quartz, the titanium
versus quartz.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the nice thing about the quartz is
you can bring that temp down even further.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just let it cool, get it, get it glowy hot
and let it go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't, don't be that, don't ever do be
that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Jason Margulies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got so many friends that'll heat the
nail until it's glowing orange and bust on
[SPEAKER_06]: a fucking timer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have timed exactly like from when
it glows right here, bro, you hit go and
[SPEAKER_06]: wait this many seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect fucking dab bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, I'm always like, no,
you waited too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have gone seven seconds sooner
than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's too cool for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it a little warm, but if I'm trying
to dab these turps, I'll oftentimes go for
[SPEAKER_06]: the quartz and go low temp, low temp.
[SPEAKER_06]: We say you got to taste it to waste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit it low temp, carb cap it, just get all
that flavor in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a little tiny dab and then grab a
Q-tip, heat the nail just a little bit and
[SPEAKER_06]: clean it out with the Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you got a fresh banger again.
[SPEAKER_06]: They call that the Q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heat the fuck out of it until it's
clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I throw another dab in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's how I roll with the banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not on the Q-tip tech and the low temp
tech, all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like take a fat dab and get it on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy Adam Hill would say, red means
go.
[SPEAKER_06]: He eats the fuck out of it and just throws
a mad dab in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's too much on my throat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Low temp is better for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Low temp is better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys, when you're trying to set the
temperature to your email, everyone's
[SPEAKER_06]: like, what temperature do I set it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Mike, you got something to jump
in with.
[SPEAKER_05]: The right setup is really key to getting
the most out of your hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take a really nice low temp dab on
an email and with the carb cap,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't waste anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even if you go really low,
it's still going to continuously heat that
[SPEAKER_05]: surface and vaporize everything off.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got it carb capped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it takes a second to get it done,
you're not going to lose anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually enjoy all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just, it's one of those things
where it takes the time and investing in
[SPEAKER_05]: the right tools to really get the best
bang out of your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of the reason I ended up
so baked here is because I've only got
[SPEAKER_05]: like half the pieces at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I low temp it, I ended up
losing a good bit off the top of my nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm taking small dabs anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that the first dab, every time I
come over here, I cough way harder than I
[SPEAKER_05]: have in a week or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I get a little bit higher than
I've been in a week or two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of that I think is because I use a
smaller rig than most folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: My rig's a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like, I prefer a smaller rig and
I prefer an E-nail on a small rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now I'm hitting the Hitman Sidecar,
the E-Series Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole rig- It's small to the point
and it heats to the point where he's got
[SPEAKER_05]: to keep an eye on the water level because
it will cook itself dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has happened before.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mad Rob is like fucking four inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love these little rigs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll cook itself raw during a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen that happen before and you
caught it before you hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Sloppy taking a dry dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: This Elevate Klein, it's taller,
but it's still got a very minimal amount
[SPEAKER_06]: of airspace.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the time that I put my dab on the
surface of this dab nail, for it to go
[SPEAKER_06]: down here, down this tube, into the water
and into my face, I want as little
[SPEAKER_06]: resistance as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to get that dab into my brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give it to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like all the percolators and
all the extra bubbles and shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's just stealing your dabs,
stealing your turps, stealing your flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want all that extra bubbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want enough water just to cool it down
from hitting that nail and then let me get
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually took dabs today through this
little rig without enough water in it,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I got ultra high.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid high because I didn't have
enough water.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of, it was kind of burny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It made my throat tingle a little bit,
but holy shit, I was red eyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I used a really good
portable hash pen, they never last for
[SPEAKER_05]: very long, but the first time I used one,
they gave you like that first dozen hits
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Burn the fuck out of my throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the no percolation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tastes like hot plastic?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was a different company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still tasted like hot plastic because the
mouthpiece was plastic, but fuck dude,
[SPEAKER_05]: that burn lasted all week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the throat burn for a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember like when you stay at a bong,
you'd fill it, you'd get it full and you'd
[SPEAKER_06]: keep sucking and that chamber would fill
and you'd keep sucking and all your
[SPEAKER_06]: friends would be like, pull it,
pull it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd look at them like, nope,
I'm going to get high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a big ass bong hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you pull it and then all that
smoke goes in your head.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the point of a big pipe or a big
bong or a big rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fill that fucker up and then carb it and
get smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you notice a dab rig, there's no carb.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just want that fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw the carb cap on to trap the heat in
the nail and put a little vacuum in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a little tiny hole in the carb
cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get less air flowing through.
[SPEAKER_06]: That heat stays in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every bit of air that comes through moves
that oil around on the top of the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it goes into your brain and then you
get stupid high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel the need to suck like a liter
of oxygen through my bong before I start
[SPEAKER_06]: getting my dab to my face.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful six in one that's
designed for rigs or bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll fit anything on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful, beautiful invention.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time I see it and I've got extra
money in my pocket, I'm like, that's
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I remember that I don't like dab
bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just way too much volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it on the inside of the glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, that's ash that's supposed to
be in my brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the side of the glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as much as you cough and choke anyway,
you don't need to spend that extra energy
[SPEAKER_06]: on your lungs pulling a liter of air up
through your fucking tube.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love a bong for flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my primary smoking device.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cleaned my bong yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Picked up flour today and yesterday
because that's mainly what I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for a nice dab, you got to go with a
smaller rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer when you start to talk about
flour, maybe you want to segue into
[SPEAKER_06]: something else that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer indica flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was going to go shopping,
like right here on the table, I've got
[SPEAKER_06]: some blue sherb that I grew at the Greener
Healthy Wellness Garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smell so yummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then here in this container,
I got some Jeff's OG that I grew.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are both heavy indica dominant
strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one just has like that funk to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And gorgeous by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well done sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This so far is my proudest grow in this
garden, but wait until you see the next
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm already impressed, but I prefer these
indica dominant flowers that sit you down,
[SPEAKER_06]: chill you out, cushy, piney, dank flavored
flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to roll a joint with that and
I'm going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just going to taste earthy and
funky and coffee-like.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then when it comes to my dabs,
if you notice all my dab selection,
[SPEAKER_06]: everything over here is like candy
flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And should I like the cactus cooler?
[SPEAKER_06]: And over here, this one doesn't even have
a label anymore, whatever that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some of the blue sherb,
of course, the solvent list.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got super lemon haze over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is Cold Creek Kush because
obviously I like those Kush turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been going super heavy citrus lately
for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only exception is the Durban,
which is all pine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was building up to the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing like lemon G turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flavor of lemon G live resin in my
face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I could only dab, I don't know
that lemon G would be my one and only,
[SPEAKER_06]: but if I had to pick three strains that I
had to dab for the rest of my life,
[SPEAKER_06]: lemon G would be in that mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may have to replace it with lemon
Jeffrey though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to set them side by side,
take dabs, and pick about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been going sweet for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a few weeks for a while and I
just went all sweet the last six months.
[SPEAKER_05]: You like the fuel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That heavy diesel flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've loved since the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get away from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that in your dabs or your flowers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Both.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour diesel live resin is so tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a little at home right now that I
can treat myself with.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't enjoy sour diesel concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember one time I ended up with some
sour diesel concentrates on accident and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure I ended up at my place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't care for that flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it as treats for when I did shit
around the house that I didn't want to do
[SPEAKER_05]: at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say it, but like some tangy or
some jelly bean dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God, I'm a junkie, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some strawberry banana live resin
at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strawberry banana tangy, the SBT,
bro, that everybody seems to be going goo
[SPEAKER_06]: goo over the strawberry banana tangy stuff
from Crockett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Crockett for making killer
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny how being a breeder and
somebody that works in a large scale
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation facility, seeing the
difference in buds that are grown and
[SPEAKER_06]: plants that are grown for flower
production and plants that are grown
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically for oil production,
we've got a cut that we gave it to
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody in another state and they grew
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once they grew it out and saw it,
they're like, fuck this plant and they cut
[SPEAKER_06]: down all of the remaining plants of it and
they sent the flowers to an extraction lab
[SPEAKER_06]: and that extraction lab was like,
what the fuck did you send us?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, some cuts that we got
from our friends in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, what the fuck is this shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the extraction lab ran it and they
called the guy up, they're like,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro, you got to come over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the dude went over there and he took a
dab of it and he's like, this is the best
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking hash I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, this is the best hash
anyone in this fucking building has ever
[SPEAKER_06]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any more?
[SPEAKER_06]: He made a sad face because he cut down all
of the fucking plants that he had.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, I still have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's still around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ugly.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plant doesn't fit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We live in the future here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We forget it so often here.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the rest of the country and for sure
the rest of the world, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_05]: legal cannabis products or cannabis
products period, we have stuff that,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you guys went legal yesterday,
you wouldn't see for five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It just takes that kind of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This fucking strain will not finish for
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's ugly, but it makes the best oil,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So things are going to change.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to start seeing different
types of plants grown for different
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're growing specific shit at the grow
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will only be made into oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got strands that I will never let
anybody see that flower because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the oil that comes out of it is
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be fucking up.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a while now, the hash has been stalled
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wax and shatter and butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And butters just basically wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of stumbled over if I'm not
mistaken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm wrong for butter lovers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then live resin came along and people
really started thinking about where can we
[SPEAKER_05]: go next with this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that people started playing
with CO2 oil because there's a huge demand
[SPEAKER_05]: for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you're left with this goo and a
syringe that's impossible to consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, I used to hate CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, no, I hate that goopy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't taste right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that they've cleaned it up,
the taste is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it's further refined like this or
separated completely, and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: reconstitute it back on with your desk,
like do-it-yourself style, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a lot of fun mixing up the little
cocktails for yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been just taking this shatter and
dunking it straight into the turps all
[SPEAKER_05]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a long expense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a process you guys don't even want to
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: The equipment alone, you could buy a
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of nice ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for the equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this isn't the only variety I've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a local outfit that's been
bringing samples by.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their first two samples were epic
fails, like unmarketable, unsellable,
[SPEAKER_05]: not unsmokable, way better than shit
you're going to get in Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did the name of the company have a family
member in the name of the company?
No.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was just not at all a good
concentrate, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing about it was solid.
[SPEAKER_05]: But attempts three and four were really,
really nice final products that are
[SPEAKER_05]: probably going to be really popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm seeing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's products that we get people who
ask them by name.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't have people asking for the
Leafs by Snoop, but I do have people
[SPEAKER_05]: asking for new styles of hash that come
out every couple of weeks.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we send material out to... Terpex
does all the extractions for us from the
[SPEAKER_06]: green...
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terpex does all the extractions from the
green and healthy wellness garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we send out material,
we send them a lot of fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_06]: material or we send them a lot of dry
material.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fresh frozen we can request.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's obviously going to be live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't even dab in your coffin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you just thinking about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hit me a rant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking at the hash over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks nice and just got a random
cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: We send fresh frozen material out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We chop down a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We cut it into small buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We throw those buds into freezer bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those freezer bags go directly into the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get frozen immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we run to the store and get bags of
ice and put those bags of ice into a giant
[SPEAKER_06]: cooler, put that frozen material into that
cooler, drive that to a location where it
[SPEAKER_06]: is then turned into live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point, we can have it turned into
live sap, live sugar.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can almost get a live shatter from some
of the strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sour diesel won't live shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you build a relationship with the
extraction company you're working with,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have two specific extractors that we
talk to a lot that work with Terpex and we
[SPEAKER_06]: can tell them what we want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, that strain's not going
to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or that strain is going to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we know that we can get triangle
killer sugar and rude boy sap on
[SPEAKER_06]: consistent levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rude boy live resin sugar is one of my
favorite fucking things to dab at ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is so terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_06]: The high is right where I want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some things get you on the top of the
head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some things get you in the back of the
brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some you feel on the shoulders.
[SPEAKER_06]: This rude boy hits me right in the eyes
and in the forehead and it makes me dumb.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes math skills go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just makes me goofy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, dude, I like pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just fucking, I want cookies after I
smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is the 710 episode, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been talking about 710 for a whole
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should talk about the origin of 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, do you have any idea where the
number 710 came from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why 710 is part of this culture,
part of this community?
[SPEAKER_05]: You flip it up upside down and dispose
that oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because a lot of the people that
started this movement were of the age
[SPEAKER_05]: where they had beepers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's about as far as I've bothered
to follow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Adam Hill coined the phrase,
710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day, it was all about 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get together at 420 and smoke some
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get together at 710, take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you turn 710 upside down, it does say
oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the best of my knowledge, Task Rock is
the person that created the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Task Rock and a couple other guys
were either in a chat or on a conference
[SPEAKER_06]: call and they were talking about stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, we need something a little
more bougie than 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's upgrade it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it with the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this was at the same time that hash
kids were separating from flower kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: By kids, I mean like full grown adults,
but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The hustler kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where 710 came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: 710 was coined as far as I know,
to the best of my knowledge, and I've done
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of research, but Task Rock
and a couple other cats are the guys that
[SPEAKER_06]: coined the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they created 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task Rock, of course, he's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task Rock has a couple of albums out.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite songs is probably First
Place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Do It Again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Boil That Oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also does Hits From The Nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of hash-related music.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash-related music.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love to listen to some task and take
some dabs or get dabbed out and drive
[SPEAKER_06]: around and listen to some task.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hypothetically, I would like to get dabbed
out and drive around as a passenger and
[SPEAKER_06]: listen to task.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task Rock is also the founder,
proprietor, the dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: For highly educated titanium, that's Task
Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the times, if you go to a
cannabis cup event in California,
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado, those are probably the ones he
goes to.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to those cannabis cup events and
you go to the highly educated booth to
[SPEAKER_06]: purchase some highly educated products,
you are probably going to pay your money
[SPEAKER_06]: to Task Rock directly.
[SPEAKER_06]: He will be the dude there that helps you
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The task is integral in the 710 community,
integral in the 710 movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been a big part of it since the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a huge supporter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task made up the number 710, not the
number, but the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that mic stands, it might need a little
bit of Viagra.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mic got droopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the quick equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might just have to hold it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might need to give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it a Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: There happens to be Gatorade on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give it a rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't look at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just ignore it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll work again in a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to our boy Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: 710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without Task Rock, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big D is the person that gave me my very
first dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the time he was with Broadway Wellness.
[SPEAKER_06]: He moved on to be Top Shelf Extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big D moved on to be the founder and
proprietor of the Secret Cup, not the
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret Sesh, the Secret Cup, the one with
the dragon and the logo.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first hash competition I think I ever
attended.
[SPEAKER_05]: First one I ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think Task, I think Big D,
I think Adam Ill, the guys from Health
[SPEAKER_06]: Stone Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, I'm going to give a little
bit of credit to Hitman Glass Duggy
[SPEAKER_06]: because he does make the rigs that a lot
of us are purchasing and smoking our hash
[SPEAKER_06]: through.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of those guys are pioneers of the
industry, old school folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Colorado, in the hash movement,
Spence did a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a huge shout out to Spence
and the Garden of Weed crew, Kind Bill,
[SPEAKER_06]: that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a lot in the hash, but honestly,
we all owe a huge high five to Derek
[SPEAKER_06]: Cummings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Derek.
[SPEAKER_06]: That dude did so much for hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an inside joke, but hashtag fuck
Derek.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just kind of an inside joke with
all of his friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Derek did a lot for learning about
hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Derek did a lot of research and learned a
whole lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course there's Tony V.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole bunch of guys doing stuff
for hash and Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: But shout out to all the people that
helped get 710 popular, originated that
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task Rock, we're going to play Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the original people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many people involved in keeping
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been fun to watch it grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes so rapidly now that it's legal
that we can do whatever we want with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The equipment, the products have just,
every couple of months I got to go buy all
[SPEAKER_06]: new shit just to have what I need to have
to be on top of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like any other tech right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every six months it evolves two to three
times faster and more effective than it
[SPEAKER_05]: was before.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Terps are available by themselves now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every part of the legal marijuana
industry, which is fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a huge variety of products about a
year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all getting really, really,
really good now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so much fun to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got to legalize it where you
live.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when I was like the only one that
had little jars of Terps on the table?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you probably will be for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people out there now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're available at a lot of shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are eating them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are probably like,
where the fuck are Terps?
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps are terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terpenoids are the compounds that mainly
provide the flavor and aroma to your
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and or cannabis concentrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're part of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Palaeids and the esters have a lot to
do with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flavonoids have a lot to do with the
flavor obviously, but the terpenoids are
[SPEAKER_06]: mainly what play the part of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: They work on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mostly the part that you get.
[SPEAKER_06]: They also contribute to your high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the OG Kush one makes me a
little more mellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives me a body thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of makes my body go wong,
wong, wong, wong, wong.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Go Strain Haze makes my head go
like I just dabbed a fucking bottle
[SPEAKER_06]: rocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, essentially that's what separates
indica from sativa is what you've refined
[SPEAKER_05]: into that tiny little jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everything around the THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some other stuff that goes into
that, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had to describe somebody to
somebody, if you had to show them
[SPEAKER_06]: strongly, this is the difference between
indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would definitely be a good way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just take that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those two examples.
[SPEAKER_05]: One's a heavy sativa, one's a heavy
indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're way too high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch, try this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just put them to bed with the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their problem was I'm way too high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't give them another dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'd give them a dab of some really CBD
heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some CBD heavy dabs that would calm
them the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy the cherry flavor, bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this talk about dabs has got me
wanting a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got some of this mob boss shatter
and I've ducked it into some Go Strain
[SPEAKER_06]: Haze turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the turps on the tip of the
dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks like a little wet spot on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Mike, tell all of our listeners how
they can find you on social media and make
[SPEAKER_05]: sure you include your Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can catch me at Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws on Facebook or at
[SPEAKER_05]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_05]: on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that dab was massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to turn colors right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even going to choke, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to keep talking in the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you can turn colors without
choking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see now he's pasty white.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's going to red.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a proper 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a shade of purple here in a
couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel it coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice dark red and then purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do it for the turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to get turpy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like having, I've always
described a haze strains and the nose
[SPEAKER_06]: strain haze is really, it's definitely
stands out for what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a velvet thing that happens
on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just feels like, like, you know,
when you smell lilacs or lavender,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's that specific thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost has a similar coating like that
that happens, but it's more enjoyable to
[SPEAKER_06]: me because I fucking hate lilacs and
lavender for some reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the smell of that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes my nose feel like I got particles
in my nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like lavender when I'm surprised
with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if we check into a hotel and we get
up to the room and it's all over,
[SPEAKER_05]: it drives me fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably worse shit in that hotel
room than that lavender, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I know, but it's the lavender
that I've like choke on and can feel in my
[SPEAKER_05]: mouth for like the next hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's, it definitely has a coating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we're just equally high.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to 710.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out the task.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something else I want to talk
about on this episode that is not really a
[SPEAKER_06]: dab related, not really 710 related,
but it needs to be mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amendment 139.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a group, I don't know exactly
who put this petition out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a group that was petitioning to
limit all cannabis products to 16% THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The buds that we grow at the green and
healthy wellness, this shit tests anywhere
[SPEAKER_06]: from 20 to 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing is lower than 22, I wouldn't
guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: The average THC content in Colorado is 18.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who the fuck is growing that shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Step it up, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Step it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's actually a pretty solid demand
for stuff that's between like 12 and 16%.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that retired after 35 years doing
shit they were drug tested for,
[SPEAKER_05]: they really don't want our moonshine
potency weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They freak out when they try to roll a
joint of it and smoke it like they did
[SPEAKER_05]: back in 1974.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, just take a couple puffs and put
that fucker out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they liked the whole like pass
it back and forth with their wife or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a friend who writes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so they like stuff that they can
smoke on a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just smoke on it and just have it burn in
while he's writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a call for that, but the
average is 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the estimates are that this should
have shut down 80% of the industry as we
[SPEAKER_05]: know it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't want to, I would move to a
place where I could grow high quality
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well no, immediately all conscience rates
gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the edibles gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the strains on the shelf gone.
We couldn't have dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the vapor cartridges gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what's the point of a vapor cart
that's 16%?
[SPEAKER_05]: That would fuel the black market so well.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the design is the people that
were behind it wanted it to kill the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know that a public vote to an
amendment 64 statewide would die
[SPEAKER_05]: laughably.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this was their more reasonable
attempt to give voters to go along with
[SPEAKER_05]: gutter cutting the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were three parts to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to add child proof
packaging, which we already do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted us to add a health warning
that said this causes like irreparable
[SPEAKER_05]: brain damage or some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already do health warnings that are
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're willing to add more reasonable
health warnings, but we're not really to
[SPEAKER_05]: add some random bullshit that you just
thought up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was going to limit potency to
16%.
[SPEAKER_05]: The group behind this claims they have 80%
of the public support on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What public where?
[SPEAKER_05]: That they won't tell you, but they're
pretty sure it exists somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: They definitely didn't ask any dad kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's 80% of the people at the last
anti-pop meeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But 80% of the people at Parker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my hometown.
[SPEAKER_05]: They really, really hate marijuana and
they wanted to shut us down this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They claim they have a huge amount of
support, which is nonsense.
[SPEAKER_05]: They withdrew their effort today.
[SPEAKER_05]: They essentially said they're going to
stop trying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason they stopped trying is kind
of funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: They claimed that the group of marijuana
industry supporters and businesses that
[SPEAKER_05]: formed to oppose this effort called up all
of the petition signature gathering
[SPEAKER_05]: companies in Colorado that are good at
what they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And can actually get a statewide ballot
effort on the signatures collected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's like a hundred thousand or
98,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are companies in Colorado that can
definitely get that done for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they all got a phone call from
the marijuana people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, we're going to hire you for
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead and bill us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just hung up the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they raised enough money to apparently
make that offer to the two biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: companies or three biggest companies in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the off chance that anti-pop people
tried to hire all three, they were
[SPEAKER_05]: prepared to pay all three to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the anti-pop people were like,
well, if we have to do this ourselves,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's go ahead and not do it.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which makes me laugh, especially when
they're like, well, we have an 80% support
[SPEAKER_05]: of the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just, they kind of played old school
drug dealer tactics though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just pop it up on Facebook and you
say, Hey, community that supports this so
[SPEAKER_05]: much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need all of you to grab a signature and
take it to work the next day and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, sign this 80% of the, it's just such
nonsense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have 80% of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they claimed that the marijuana
industry raised tens and millions,
[SPEAKER_05]: tens of millions of dollars to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this shit's public.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is know where to Google
and you can check how much they raised.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 400 grand.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sad part is that if you handed a
petition to most people and you're like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, would you like to limit the THC?
[SPEAKER_06]: And cannabis to 16%.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what the fuck they mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like stop bugging me.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I sign, will you stop bugging me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ring that fucking bell.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I sign this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sucks that people are just willing
to sign shit too, without even knowing
[SPEAKER_06]: what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: By law, you have to print the actual
language that you're asking people to sign
[SPEAKER_05]: for across the top of the sheet.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sign.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't be a separate page or nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's, there's a lot of rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the people we've, we've discussed
this before on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the people at Walmart are in
their pajamas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when you're, when you're out really
collecting this stuff and trying to get
[SPEAKER_05]: people to give a shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one reads it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just in a fucking hurry.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to sign it and get you the hell
out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a resident?
[SPEAKER_06]: You live in the county, 18 sign here,
sign here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much what you get.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that shit got dropped.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did not pass you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave up because the group behind it
is, has pledged to reform as a broader
[SPEAKER_05]: coalition of people uniting to fuck over
the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, it just sounds like a
whole bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of big words that they're lawyer
type for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The funny part is, is a big part of their
press release today.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, well, this former high
school principal who was, who was behind
[SPEAKER_05]: this said this and this, this local parent
who's behind the other person behind this
[SPEAKER_05]: said this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sitting there reading a press
release from a major anti-marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: personality in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the press release talks about major
funding from a national anti-marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: group.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you keep reading the article,
it talks about the actual people behind
[SPEAKER_05]: the initiative who aren't these local
lovable characters like a teacher and a
[SPEAKER_05]: parent.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're major politicians from around the
country who make a living doing stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're able to portray it as like,
oh, there's, there's just these little
[SPEAKER_05]: folks being picked on by big industry
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, do you threatened a billion
dollar industry and they raised 300 grand
[SPEAKER_05]: to knock you out of the fight?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, come on now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just gave me a perfect segue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we start wrapping up the show,
give me an update on what is going on with
[SPEAKER_06]: the effort to eliminate and or eradicate
recreational cannabis from Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So locally our petition effort has been
significantly more successful than the one
[SPEAKER_05]: statewide.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have all their signatures turned in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like they've got more than enough
valid signatures to make the ballot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two questions in front of the
courts right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first question is how many signatures
they should have collected.
[SPEAKER_05]: They collected 5% of the voter signatures
from last election down here, which was
[SPEAKER_05]: like 5,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: They collected 9,000 almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're covered there if it's 5%.
[SPEAKER_05]: But recently a bill was passed at the
state level requiring this specific
[SPEAKER_05]: question, if it's going to be put on a
ballot anywhere to have 15% of past voter
[SPEAKER_05]: signatures, which would jack that number
to around 14 or 15,000, which means they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have near enough signatures gathered
and they need to get back out there and
[SPEAKER_05]: gather signatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: That decision should come any day now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's Friday when we're recording
this, it'll be Sunday.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll probably be within four or five
days of this coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get that decision, hopefully maybe
as many as 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're Rasta Seb, this will be
Monday because he's from the future,
[SPEAKER_05]: he's from the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully within seven or 10 days,
we get that first decision about what
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage of the vote they should have
gathered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Odds are strong that the judge is going to
rule that 5% is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently we had a local politician make a
primary ballot and ended up in front of
[SPEAKER_05]: the same judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the judge's ruling was, yes,
he failed to follow the law here and here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he broke that rule there,
but elections are about choices and why
[SPEAKER_05]: not give you guys him as one of those
choices.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people were like,
wait, what, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: But kind of, I guess, like the judge gets
to make the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they wear the outfit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why they have the jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let him make them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the decision they made.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're kind of expecting the same thing
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another court issue that involves
some serious campaign finance stuff that
[SPEAKER_05]: could really keep them off the ballot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado and pretty much every state in
the union has very serious laws that
[SPEAKER_05]: govern their elections.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you would like to put something on an
official election ballot, there are rules
[SPEAKER_05]: you must follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: The anti-marijuana people down here are
terrible at following rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very fun character trait for them
to have if you're me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as soon as they said they were running
a public ballot, I was hoping for
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of important ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can't handle a licensing
hearing at the county level, running a
[SPEAKER_05]: county wide ballot issue is probably going
to trip you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like it has.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things is you can't raise money
in a jar to fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a thing in politics.
[SPEAKER_05]: If this donation's over $20, I got to get
your name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to get your serial number.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just how elections go.
[SPEAKER_05]: The money is tracked like that unless
you're super rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by which case, you can donate hundreds
of millions of dollars to a company to run
[SPEAKER_05]: evil attack ads and shit, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're a little guy trying to give
$24, you got to give me your name and your
[SPEAKER_05]: serial number.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just throw a jar up on the
piano.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the night, have 300 or
1,000 bucks in there and call it good
[SPEAKER_05]: enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they did that twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's major polling that
they've bragged about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people don't understand what kind
of money is involved when you poll people
[SPEAKER_05]: in a county like Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not a big county.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only 150,000 people down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: A poll like that still costs 10,
15, 20, $25,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: The good ones cost 25, 35, $40,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that'll really give you the
information you want are expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did one of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: They paid for one of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know all about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for some reason, they're lying about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to play out really
interestingly in court.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have access to the truth on those
surveys?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what the results they got
back, but we know they bragged about them
[SPEAKER_05]: enough to the local hospitals,
for the local hospitals to put literature
[SPEAKER_05]: together that involved or that referenced
the polling done.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know who did the poll.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know who paid for the poll.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know who probably got handed the check
that paid for the poll.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know who probably cashed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's disturbing that they're lying about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All they had to do was put it on their
campaign finance report and nobody gives a
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they keep claiming to the press
that they didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And eventually the judge is going to want
to know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's an issue that could keep them
off the ballot too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with the money in the jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big enough screw up to keep you
off the ballot.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to make law, you got to follow
law.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they hire a lawyer?
[SPEAKER_05]: They did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their main volunteer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's donated like $10,000 or $12,000 worth
of lawyer hours to their effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like six hours?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what he charges,
but that's on their campaign finance
[SPEAKER_05]: reports.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spent a disturbing amount of time
going through those reports.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun to work on campaigns.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The look on your face when you talk about
it is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it very well could be the death of
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really can't handle the loss this would
be to our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were on the edge for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Parts of town are still very, very bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crime is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Infrastructure spending is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we lose 60% of our construction
industry, 1,300 marijuana jobs,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the expansion that industry is
supposed to go through over the next
[SPEAKER_05]: several years, all of that real estate
floods back onto the market, that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: death blow.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those people that moved here because
somebody like myself had a job and was
[SPEAKER_06]: like, I need a helper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got somebody that I know in another
state that I trust brought them out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those people and myself would be fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a huge number of five people
that moved here within the last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people are employed by the spot?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 30, 35.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many of them are there in Pueblo West?
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 1,300 people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally, if this vote passes,
1,300 people are out of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a full 1% of our population down
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You add that immediately to the
unemployment rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like I got fired for stealing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 1,300 people got put out of work
because an industry closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one gets to apply for the job I just
lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of us are now applying for whatever
jobs were currently available when our
[SPEAKER_05]: industry shut down.
[SPEAKER_06]: What percentage of those people go home
and buy a bunch of fucking lights with
[SPEAKER_06]: their first unemployment check and build a
black market grow and start flipping black
[SPEAKER_06]: market weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we do about 20 million in annual
sales down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I figure half of that immediately goes
back into the black market and the other
[SPEAKER_05]: half goes either up the highway to
Colorado Springs or down the highway to
[SPEAKER_05]: Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tourist money goes to Trinidad and
Manitou.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical money goes to Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody doesn't feel like that's an
effort worth putting in for a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just goes back to the black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put some seeds in the dirt in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shine some lights on that bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lose out on 5 million in tax revenue
next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's paying for all kinds of cool shit
that wasn't getting paid for before
[SPEAKER_05]: because we didn't have the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: The city's starting to look decent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_06]: The potholes are going away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's starting to look... Little by little,
stuff's getting more... I noticed that the
[SPEAKER_05]: last street I drive on on my way to your
place has really just got repaid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they just repaved the whole street.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that thing's been jacked since I've
known about Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole boulevard has been rocked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pot for potholes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really does work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just little by little.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are like, why aren't our schools
perfect?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had legal weed for two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't all our streets perfect?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any info on the scholarship
that was awarded to the child?
[SPEAKER_05]: The governor doubled it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was king of the world, the
scholarship would be bigger and spendable
[SPEAKER_05]: in more places, but it's still really
awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sending 25 kids to college.
[SPEAKER_05]: That probably wouldn't have been able to
go without that two grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain a little bit how that happened to
people that haven't kept up at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our local county commissioners,
the voters passed a local excise tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of the production, when you grow
marijuana and then sell it to a retail
[SPEAKER_05]: store, it gets taxed at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that money goes into kind of a slush
fund for dream projects we couldn't pay
[SPEAKER_05]: for before.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I grow the flowers at Green and
Healthy Wellness, they have to be packaged
[SPEAKER_06]: and then transferred to the store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where the tax happens?
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was in Pueblo County, that's where
the tax would happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Colorado Springs passes an excise tax
on medical, then it'll happen there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we already did that down here for rec.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first year that tax has been
in effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So money's just starting to trickle in,
but we expect three and a half million
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars from that excise tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the bulk of the marijuana taxes
that Pueblo County is going to make next
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get 3.5 from the excise tax-ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an estimate so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it actually plans out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're definitely going to get 1.7
to 1.8 in licensing fees and sales tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the industry exists?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's through the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if the election goes against us in
November, we still get to offer it until
[SPEAKER_05]: next November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your licenses can expire as it comes up
for expiration until November 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the shop that gets their license in
November the 1st of this year is in the
[SPEAKER_05]: best shape to operate as long as possible,
regardless of the election outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that made sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a death blow to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing so much with, it's not a lot
compared to our whole county budget.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem with our county budget is
that it passed its breaking point a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: of million dollars ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just have to look at middle school
kids walking in the middle of the street
[SPEAKER_05]: with the buses and the car traffic and go,
sorry, no money for sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or crossing guards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or crossing guards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took asbestos out of a couple of
schools.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I read that in the newspaper and I was
like, asbestos in schools, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's hurting my face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just had to think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was way down in San Juan County
because that's how we're spending that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The state also collects an excise tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first 40 million from that fund
goes to school construction through our
[SPEAKER_05]: state's best program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the best program, literally when you
apply for it, you explain how your school
[SPEAKER_05]: districts broke, how they've never had
money since the forties, and how you badly
[SPEAKER_05]: need to do stuff that should have been
done 30 years ago, but you've never found
[SPEAKER_05]: a way to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're doing stuff like taking the
lead out of the pipes, taking the asbestos
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the gym.
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting pads in the playground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like, or building a playground
period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paving the road to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All kinds of crazy stuff that we really
should have done decades ago, but just
[SPEAKER_05]: never had the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were never going to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we can fund it with weed money
because it's just enough more than what we
[SPEAKER_05]: need to do everything else that wasn't
getting funded.
[SPEAKER_05]: So loop us back around to the
scholarships.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry, the scholarships they gave each
kid that wanted up to 400 kids,
[SPEAKER_05]: a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: 400 kids got a thousand bucks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was the offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only 25 ended up applying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of the reason for that is you have to
be a Pueblo high school graduate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had way more than 25 of those
dicks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone thinking that?
[SPEAKER_05]: But you had to go to college in Pueblo
County.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, if I was king of the world,
it'd be at least anywhere in Colorado.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Nebraska don't need my fucking
weed money.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just wanted to keep the money in the
county.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they just wanted to keep it in the
county.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to promote the local
university.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of cool things happening
down here at our local university.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why not keep it all local?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a good music program, a good mass
call program, but I don't know about other
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The governor liked the program so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: He used state marijuana taxes to double it
to two grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, honestly, that's books for a
whole year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's meals for most of a whole year,
for half a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on if it's you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I was a college student,
so some of these numbers aren't real
[SPEAKER_05]: unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might just be a decade old,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, $2,000 down here in Pueblo,
that's fully the difference between I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: able to go and I'm not able to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, if $2,000 is going to really
make or break that difference,
[SPEAKER_05]: like college in New York or wherever else,
I'd be happy to send you with that two
[SPEAKER_05]: grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably wasn't a make or break anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it requires a lot more to live out of
state than it does in your hometown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd still stay with the fam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that takes out a huge amount of a
huge amount.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a fantastic program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the anti-pop people are all over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, this is just propaganda.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, we're making sure that more
kids get to go to college.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not propaganda when that kid goes to
college.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that propaganda?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some real shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things people refuse to accept
is that marijuana was always here in a way
[SPEAKER_05]: that's so much larger than anyone really
wants to admit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's 60 billion coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six zero billion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's a huge amount of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody can fathom that much
cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In $20 bills, it's a couple of high
schools full probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's an insane amount of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two Olympic pools just stuffed with
hundreds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all just under the surface.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your neighbor's house.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the park your kids play at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the school your kids go to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's even the fucking prisons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like prohibition doesn't work at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right under our noses.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always has been, it always will be.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just mostly invisible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only people who are able to be visible
with it are the people with nothing to
[SPEAKER_05]: lose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one's willing to admit that in
Colorado anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's like, it's new, especially the
anti-pop people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all we did was shift where people buy
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're able to do so many cool things
with that money because it's a legit
[SPEAKER_05]: industry now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make turps because now we got
science.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to be afraid to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get caught buying the equipment
that it takes to make these turps at the
[SPEAKER_06]: store, they turn you in for making a
fucking meth lab back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it can be like, no, we're with
this dispensary and we need all this
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment to make hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can more effectively treat
patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone forgets about the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all about getting turped out now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to spend the first 20 minutes with
a new big fat bag of weed looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: mold, looking for mildew, looking for
washers, spider eggs, all kinds of nasty
[SPEAKER_05]: funks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten toenails in weed before.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's shit we used to put up with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that it's all gone now,
the benefits stream, it's endless.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so far past the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for a place like Pueblo, the money's
vital.
[SPEAKER_05]: South of us, a town even smaller,
the sheriff was in the paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't sure what to think at first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look what it's done to the downtown area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They built a river walk down there because
of cannabis money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trinidad's not going to die now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pueblo was, we had steel here and steel
isn't as big as it used to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: People want to go lightweight now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's titanium and we don't have a
titanium mill.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a steel mill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people were leaving and people
don't want to work at a steel mill forever
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of the technology era.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are getting the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stan was going bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lived here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike and I have been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were here before all the cannabis shit
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen this town.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a little cow town when I
moved here and it's flourishing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's actually going somewhere now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of proud.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're finally crawling out of the funk we
were in for like 40 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flood fucked us up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, it was when the steel
mill started to slow down.
[SPEAKER_05]: A whole huge generation of people didn't
have an easy way to feed their families
[SPEAKER_05]: down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't easy to find work anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really had to work at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I moved here, you had to know
somebody that was hiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how this town is.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of those towns where you could
fill out a thousand applications and
[SPEAKER_06]: unless you know somebody here,
you're not going to get a job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the job and housing listings never
make it online here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you drive up and down the streets you
want to live on and look for someone
[SPEAKER_05]: putting out a for rent sign and walk up
and talk to that person before it sits out
[SPEAKER_05]: there too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing with jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard a friend of yours got fired.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wander into wherever they used to work and
talk to the manager stat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because otherwise there ain't no job for
you in the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's slowly changing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have hiring or staffing agencies now
that help people get a foothold in the
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an industry down here that's going
to need a hundred more trimmers next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Linus.
[SPEAKER_05]: The real downside is that we're not
publicizing in all 50 states when it takes
[SPEAKER_05]: the work in this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: But people think that they can show up
late and take a shit and be 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: late and hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talk to people every day that are
shocked to learn it's like a real
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think you can just hang out and smoke
joints all day and fuck off.
[SPEAKER_05]: They thought their high school weed dealer
had a store now where he just kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: hung out and played Xbox and then waded
weed at his table.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you gave him money and it was
weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they'd leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: They walk in and they see what looks
basically like an Apple store or a purse
[SPEAKER_05]: or shoe store in the mall.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just gave me a chance to tease
something that we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to wait until you and Lindsay are
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about the weirdest
shit that people have ever done in a
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was asked to do that episode today by
someone at work who listened to the
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary etiquette episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about that when
Lindsay's available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay just got back from a little
vacation and she took the night off.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was invited, but she needed a nappy
poo.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's cuddling up with Scooby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Scooby the dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: What up, Scoob?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Scoobs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to that air conditioner over
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to get Lindsay on and
we're going to talk about some weird shit
[SPEAKER_06]: that's happened in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a pretty good story myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dispensaries are awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really magical place where the
bananaramic shit happens on the regular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when we had a store way back in
the wild fucking West days, some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy shit that would happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got to save those stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a cheesy ass grin on my face because
we ran the place before you could get a
[SPEAKER_06]: weed card.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day you could walk in and go,
my leg hurts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need weed card.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd say, how much money you got?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd tell them they'd write you that
many plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great fucking day.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't even care back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like weed card for sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was in the very first days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like even the doctors were at the fringe
of society because the DEA was still
[SPEAKER_05]: threatening that if a doctor wrote a
recommendation for marijuana in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_05]: that they could lose their DEA license to
write prescriptions for anything,
[SPEAKER_05]: any other drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the doctors that were like the
first five doctors in Colorado to sign
[SPEAKER_05]: paperwork, period, were the kind of
doctors where like, if you were there
[SPEAKER_05]: because you fell on something and it went
through like your forearm or your leg,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'd start talking to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after 15 minutes or so, you'd be like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doc, I'm just going to the next doc up the
road.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care that I'm impaled for
something that's not going to kill me
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that changed six months later when
they stopped hounding doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that weird ass doc that used to
come to- Ponytail?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, with the ponytail.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was the husband.
[SPEAKER_05]: The husband had a ponytail and a cane.
[SPEAKER_05]: The doctor was the woman who wouldn't look
you in the eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about the crazy guy and the
crazy wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to come together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well see, I was working in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lady that owned that dispensary used
to bake edibles and she would show up with
[SPEAKER_06]: trays of edibles and she'd be like,
Mike and Jeff, you have to try- Pony,
[SPEAKER_06]: this carrot cake, this banana bread,
this cookie.
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes, here's the nine products I make.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's your nine samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you restock the shelves with the
rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five minutes later, she'd go, which one
did you eat?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd go, it's 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was at work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she would go, well, which one are you
going to eat right now in front of me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she'd stare at you and then look
at the pile of options you had,
[SPEAKER_05]: really curious as to what you might pick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally oblivious that you took this a
little more seriously than she did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you're not interested in finding out
how strong she made them this week at 11 a
[SPEAKER_05]: .m.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 15 minutes after you ate the first
one, she'd ask you what the next one was
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some days where I don't know
how we made it through clothes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some times when the numbers
were a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some days I wasn't sure people
were keeping numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure there were some eight gram
quarters going out the door sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there was a window that we had to
stay with in between and we just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: kept it from going too far outside of that
little box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Karen and her homemade
Edibles that used to fucking wreck my
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were fucking restless about that
banana bread.
[SPEAKER_06]: Josh and I fell down the stairs,
like fucking rolled down the dance.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a switch back stairs too and
they would tumble down it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Laughing like ladies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember walking up three flights of
stairs in ridiculous heat because it got
[SPEAKER_05]: really hot in that building.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd get to the third floor knowing
that that was where I needed to go and
[SPEAKER_05]: have no idea why I was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd get halfway back downstairs before
I remembered whatever it was I went up
[SPEAKER_05]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: That place was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Edibles, I'm pretty sure I
mentioned eating a 1000 milligram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, excuse me for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: A 1000 milligram Edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't eat a 1000 milligram Edible unless
you want to be fucked up for a day and a
[SPEAKER_06]: half.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not me, probably three days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like a civilian, if you gave that
to like anybody else that we know that
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't smoke like a soldier.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pull up an article at home
entitled, I drank the weed lube.
[SPEAKER_05]: She claims to be high for three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 100 milligram Edible, if people get
novices gobble that sucker up six,
[SPEAKER_05]: eight hours is what people report.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you ate the 100 milligram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff's talking about a 1000.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I ate a 1000 milligram Edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honest, I haven't been, I've been gun shy,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't eaten an Edible since then.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a little bit scurred.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it to myself the other day and it
wasn't even with a really big dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I popped a couple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I'd be comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to the movie theater.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just blown the fuck away.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were so many food choices.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before I could figure out what I
wanted, I heard my wife giggling next to
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like she's not a smoker, but she knows
when I look up and I'm just too big to
[SPEAKER_05]: pick from the menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't mean to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it happens to the pros too,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1000 milligrams was rough on my system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: My whole body felt weird for a day and a
half.
[SPEAKER_05]: People assume that that's like the
comfortable intro to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumption and it's not like smokings,
the time test, smoke some flowers through
[SPEAKER_06]: a pipe, smoke some flowers through a bong
or a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get used to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a dab one day, take like three dabs
in one day and then start taking big dabs
[SPEAKER_06]: and then dab every day and then eat some
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Progress slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like a good rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you can, you can, you can look
people in the eye and say, I don't eject
[SPEAKER_05]: what I'm addicted to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just buy glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different kind of glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just rig after rig after rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass,
517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need a rig, go get a rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really need to legalize it in your
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really can't stress the benefits
enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make your table look like mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just glass rigs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just want, you want to hear this kind
of shit at your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to hear glass rigs taking on
each other all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: At Oil Slick, it's a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's 85% of this table cover.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike's giving a shout.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the table is covered in oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm about to give away something again.
[SPEAKER_05]: You better wrap it up fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants this old shoe?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really ironic.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another story that matches up with
what you just said.
[SPEAKER_06]: I stepped in dog shit today.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time in a really long time that
I stepped in dog shit and I stepped in
[SPEAKER_06]: some shit today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening

[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's wife, thanks for letting Mike come

cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day I posted a picture of a
butterfly just to get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: variety on my page, but I usually post a
whole bunch of good cannabis photography,
[SPEAKER_06]: big bud shots, big room shots,
trichome shots.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to post a whole bunch of great
shit.

[SPEAKER_06]: Send us some demo guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need some to pick apart.

[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said I'd be right back with our friend
Jesse and guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, let's tell everybody about your
social media so that they can stalk you
[SPEAKER_06]: while they're listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can they find you online?
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram, jessiegrows, at jessiegrows,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: At jessiegrows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I post a couple picks a week there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glorious cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just crap I find interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those are very similar things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a website?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've got, I do Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on SoundCloud and we're also on
our own website at coloradopodcast.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys support the Colorado
podcast and my friends, Jesse,
[SPEAKER_06]: Despicable D and our boy 44.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very podcasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's loosely cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get around to talking about weed every
now and then, but wacky and wild
[SPEAKER_04]: adventures for the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the mullet of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so using that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your podcast had a haircut,
it would certainly have a mullet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mic may jump out of that little clip
if you have it like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good adjustment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys support his podcast,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jesse is kind of an outdoor grow
expert.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been on the show several times if
you've listened.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows a lot about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot about indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had some outdoor questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse wants to talk a little bit about the
differences in small basement cultivation
[SPEAKER_06]: compared to large commercial growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get into that also.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's talk about an email that I got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got an email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the email on my phone right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just set the phone aside today.
[SPEAKER_06]: But shout out to the guy that sent me an
email.
[SPEAKER_06]: He asked, when he's growing outdoors,
how big of a hole does he want to dig to
[SPEAKER_06]: put his plant in?
[SPEAKER_06]: I told him through an email, I told him to
listen to the show and I'd have Jesse on
[SPEAKER_06]: for more info, but I told him basically
make the hole as big as you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else can you tell us about that,
Jesse?
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally, over the years, I've noticed
a plant's somewhat limited, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: when it's in the ground by the size of its
container.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your hole has a pre-mixed soil in it,
the shoulders of the plants aren't going
[SPEAKER_04]: to go too far past the edge of that hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started off with two by two holes and
worked up to three by three holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I do four by four holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it'll probably keep going
someday, five by five holes.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're doing these four by four
holes, you're doing a four by four square,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four feet wide, four feet long?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: How deep are you going?
[SPEAKER_04]: 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to go deeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned a little bit more about the
root system of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I right in thinking that cannabis wants
to root outward instead of downward?
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it does like to go down,
especially if you're going from seed
[SPEAKER_04]: plants to get the tap root in there,
which can be extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most
[SPEAKER_04]: part, by 18 inch or three
[SPEAKER_06]: foot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a lot of damn dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how many cubic feet that is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'd have to do the math on the size
of the hole that you just said,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's 5.5.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's got to be more than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because one of those Fox Farm bags is 1.75
cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many of those bags do you think it
would take?
[SPEAKER_06]: 3.8 cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how growers think in math,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably how it's supposed to take
cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd take three chromic spells to
fill it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of root space.
[SPEAKER_06]: How big are these plants then?
[SPEAKER_06]: In your example, how big are your plants
at the end of the season?
[SPEAKER_04]: Four or five foot around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all the way around, not just
through one spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't hug your plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get your arms around them and
hug them?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, hell no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of limit my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can only get about six foot tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was able to let them get bigger,
they'd probably end up eight, nine foot
[SPEAKER_04]: tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're limited by privacy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's such a bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do such a great outdoor grow to limit
you as a bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to fight it real hard to keep them
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have learned a new trick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just plant later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant later, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the new trick?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super high tech?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to bend them as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to top as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just take them out later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag lazy tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoop tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when are we, are we in the flowering
phase officially yet, or do we still have
[SPEAKER_06]: a few days to go?
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we've still got a week or so
to go.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in about a week here in Colorado,
and we were doing research before the
[SPEAKER_06]: show, from coast to coast, there's only
about a half hour in sunlight photo
[SPEAKER_06]: period, in natural photo period.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse was doing the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And difference between what I was finding,
it was like New York, the sun was coming
[SPEAKER_04]: up at 539 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Los Angeles, it was coming up at
like 608 or some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's odd.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so photo period, it's going to
start really shrinking from here on out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And first you're going to get your indica
varieties into flower, and then your more
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa varieties will follow along behind
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your flow and blueberry, those are really
going to start taking off right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Flow specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone in Colorado that grows flow,
that bitch is going to go into flower real
[SPEAKER_06]: hard here in about a week, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll be spitting out calyxes real soon
for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see pistols in like 20 days,
I bet.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant later.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just such a ridiculous solution for
easy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been my goal lately is just
K-I-S-S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the size of your plant, sorry,
I keep clearing the throat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, we're taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about these dabs for a brief
second.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was dunking my dabber into 90% THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 91% THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a distillate from our friends at
EvoLab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I take the 90% distillate that's
on my dabber and I dunk that into pure
[SPEAKER_06]: turpinoids of ghost train haze also made
by our friends at EvoLabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is amazing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the best highs you can get.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first couple of times I smoked this,
I got stupid high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just goofy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to go back to work and I pretty
much just ended up doing stuff on the
[SPEAKER_06]: computer for the next hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like, yeah, metric needs to be
updated somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I got to sit down in a chair for a
minute, but a shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why my throat's a little bit
clogged.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do apologize for being so congested
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those OG Kush dabs were heavenly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it though?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got OG ghost train haze turps and OG
Kush turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a couple of nights ago,
I took some of this 120 micron blue sherb,
[SPEAKER_06]: fresh frozen, solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I rolled out a little piece into a
taco shell and I put some, what did I
[SPEAKER_06]: have?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a cactus cooler.
[SPEAKER_06]: A live resin on top of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smeared that on like taco sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I took a piece of Durbin poison
shatter and rolled it into a little snake
[SPEAKER_06]: and put that in the middle, like some taco
meat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I dumped the dabber into the 90%
THC distillate and had that on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I picked up the taco with the
dabber and dumped that into the ghost
[SPEAKER_06]: train haze turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was blast off high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was rocket high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have put a little THC in there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: My arm hair was wiggling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, woo!
[SPEAKER_06]: I was making funny faces and funny noises.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really high for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first turp dab, my arms and legs went
very pleasantly numb for like almost
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something about smoking just raw
turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I immediately, I was like, damn,
this is medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's great recreation,
but for someone somewhere that's
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to take just the normal shatter
I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got this Durbin poison mob boss
shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just take little chunks of that and
dunk that into the OG Kush dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes it taste so amazing.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mob boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one I haven't heard of in a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: When this is gone, I don't know if I'm
going to be able to properly get high
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore because I've been smoking this
distillate and these turps so heavily that
[SPEAKER_06]: my tolerance game has upped itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I go smoke with other people,
they're just like, dude, what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, don't you want more dabs?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're in the corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, come on, let's party.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more quick question on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think the turps, I mean,
I think I already know the answer to this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'll just ask, do the turps complete
if you dip it in just like a normal
[SPEAKER_04]: shatter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the turps complete something there or
make it more powerful in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_06]: It pushes it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It pushes the high a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: It certainly pushes the high up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the, my theory, it's probably not
such a theory.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the turpinoids work along with the
cannabinoids, just like the entourage
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The turpinoids that we're using guys,
it looks just like, it looks like pee.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just little drops of gold in a vial.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the consistency of like a really
high grade, like a machine oil or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say really runny olive oil,
a little runnier than olive oil maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just dunk the dab right into it is
what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been putting a dab on the dabber and
just dunk it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did, I dunked it too hard one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just dunked it in there and gave it a
little swizzle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it hit the nail, I heard the
turps go like sizzled and I had turp face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my mouth just tasted like ghost train
haze forever, but it was almost
[SPEAKER_06]: unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, I OD'd my face on turps,
but then I was rocket high.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of, you can almost wash away the
flavor with too much, like it's so
[SPEAKER_04]: overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even get anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just burn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You maximum overload your mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, I can't taste anything
because you just ruined my palette.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like when you eat something too spicy
for the next hour, everything just tastes
[SPEAKER_06]: spicy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to our friend that sent us an email
about digging holes, the bigger the hole,
[SPEAKER_06]: the bigger the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse recommends about a three by three,
four by four, about 18 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fill it with the best soil that you can
afford.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put some amendments in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give them a list of five.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have good amendments to throw in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Worm castings, oyster shell, alfalfa,
kelp meal, neem seed meal, and caranja
[SPEAKER_06]: seed meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's six.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to throw in crab shell or oyster
or shrimp shell meal in there too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much set there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I hope you wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_06]: If not hit that little 15 second back
button twice and you'll get it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that stuff in that big hole with your
soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe put some perlite in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For rice holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lava rock.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some sort of drainage.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get some oxygen in there,
but you don't want to take up too much
[SPEAKER_06]: root space with a bunch of rock and
perlite.
[SPEAKER_06]: So figure out your mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outdoor soil doesn't need to be as airy as
indoor soil, especially in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can do yourself a great disservice
by putting too much perlite in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to increase the frequency
of having to water it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's why you're the outdoor pro and
I'm the indoor guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to my friend that sent me
the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep the emails coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have any more follow up questions,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get them on the show for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mulch that soil up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it mulched.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes a huge, huge difference at the
end of the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally, totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to talk about a bunch
of stuff for outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got questions this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our friend Fred, Fred Garvin,
he keeps the messages coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fred listens to the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: He listens to both of our shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to do more of the swap
casts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll duct tape Adam next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up 44?
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also love picking on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Fred sent us a message a while back.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was making seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: He put pollen on female plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those plants have now been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're forming seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: He put them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had many questions about putting them
outdoors, about acclimating them to the
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor area and how to get the timer
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I messaged Jesse about this,
Jesse had a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse said that once those plants are
pollinated, if you go put them outside and
[SPEAKER_06]: the light cycles a little bit off,
they're not going to herm because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: already pollinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've pretty much passed their,
I guess if they were humans, now they
[SPEAKER_06]: would be in menopause if they were
females.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they can't, they're past that
cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their whole sexual reproductive thing is
done.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already decided they're making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a manifest destiny to complete.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if a girl's pregnant, you can't
already get her pregnant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those plants that we told Fred to put
outside should be a hundred percent legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also mentioned in one of his emails
that his outdoor plants were in full
[SPEAKER_06]: flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's totally going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally fine there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to Fred for sending me
messages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you've got at least an iRegenetics
sticker or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me a message,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me that it's you because I know that
that's not your real name, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know better than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me an email and we'll get you some
more stickers or something if you want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love all of your input.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to clear that one out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to edit that, throw it clear
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a friend on Facebook that her or his
name, I'm pretty sure it's a her though,
[SPEAKER_04]: is the last name.
[SPEAKER_04]: First and last name is a movie star.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I called her out on it one time in a
private message.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I know your name's fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you figure that out?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, duh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like so-and-so, so-and-so,
and so-and-so, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're clever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just slipping on your secret tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody is who they say they are on
Facebook, but I use my real name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you think about what you're posting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't spend time trolling people if
you got your name in Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't spend time trolling people if
you got your name in Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember what they are off the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I learned a few.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: As I go, I'm like, that one's this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just absorbed those slowly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so he's got his plants
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then, his shit got attacked by
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he asked, I don't have his email in
front of me, but basically he said,
[SPEAKER_06]: none of this plant material is going to be
consumed or smoked by people since it's
[SPEAKER_06]: all just seeded.
[SPEAKER_06]: How nuclear can I go to spray the fuck out
of it for these spider mites?
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion would be as nuclear as he is
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I told him.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what I told him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told him, keep in mind his health while
he's applying pesticides and keep in mind
[SPEAKER_06]: the health of the rest of his garden,
because I know he's got other cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plants out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the insects in that garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The normal biodiversity of that area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be aware of that.
Bees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, don't kill the bees.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the bees go away, everything goes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have food if we don't have bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw my dad's neighbor spraying Roundup
in his yard the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and chased that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, see those three white boxes
over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: And instantly he was like, oh man,
I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got him set up with some Epsom salt and
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll get rid of almost any insect that
you don't want to round.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Several, several tablespoons of Epsom salt
per gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask you about how to get rid of
fucking grasshoppers right now in a ganja
[SPEAKER_06]: garden outdoors?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a very popular question lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're super heavy everywhere this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife, Bernadette.
[SPEAKER_04]: My life.
[SPEAKER_04]: My life.
[SPEAKER_04]: My beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a list of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot require or recall any of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of them, knowing the way they
work and how grasshoppers work,
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt really were necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I didn't feel like, you may kill
one or two grasshoppers with it or you may
[SPEAKER_04]: discourage one or two, but it's,
so my big thing, mow the weeds around your
[SPEAKER_04]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the biggest ones that take
away their food supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, molasses traps, which is, um,
a mason jar that is a quarter of the way
[SPEAKER_04]: filled with water, a quarter of the way
filled with molasses buried to the rim,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, around the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's kind of arcade, you know,
really simple here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's building the moat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's, they fall in it and they
can't get out.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, try to attract Blue Jays and Robins to
your grow area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Robins, I don't know how to attract
Blue Jays.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know really like peanuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is going to show up if we throw
out peanuts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is that going to bring rabbits?
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose so possibly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my first idea, I told my friend to put
a chicken in his yard to get rid of his
[SPEAKER_06]: grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to bring me more problems?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in the beginning stages, chickens love
grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have juvenile marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you've got a four or five foot tall
bush, uh, the chicken is going to use it
[SPEAKER_04]: as shade and it really isn't going to
notice it too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might pick at the understory a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might clean it up for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might do some lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Pedro, it's time to go to work buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chickens don't have to have badges.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a whole bunch of undocumented chickens
running this fucking ganja farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're fucking doing pest management and
lollipopping plants for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're geniuses over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's train some chickens, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, four cocks tree service.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This got weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, blame it on the Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag blame it on the Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: One other comment on, uh, grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hippy dippy when it comes to growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, as soon as I hear about a grasshopper
problem, I feel like something's out of
[SPEAKER_04]: balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of killing the grasshopper,
you might want to look at the bigger
[SPEAKER_04]: picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something's missing there or if you're
doing something wrong or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say that's like 75% of the
time that is the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, I feel like this applies to
smaller grows like those guys out on Salem
[SPEAKER_04]: road where they've got four acres planted
in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, that's a completely different
scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have those issues
regardless.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a lot of damn cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went out and drove and looked at it
today, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a near Bula.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a drive out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the green mile for a reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing huge things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone talks shit about Pueblo,
Colorado, but everywhere around us is
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouses and outdoor grows and just
acres and acres of hemp and acres and
[SPEAKER_06]: acres of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so rad right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive out there a 50 and 96.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need more places to more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know that there's a technical
term for these restaurants, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: fast casual, I think more fast casual
restaurants because that's what the grow
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and people like us, that's what
we crave.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want the Taco bell, the Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated going here earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you got there is that Sonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's D I don't, I there's nothing at
Sonic for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_06]: McDonald's offers nothing for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many fast food places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes Jimmy John's, if that's even,
you know, in a Qdoba and Chipotle,
[SPEAKER_06]: because you can get a veggie burrito
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much the options.
[SPEAKER_06]: The beans at both those places tastes like
hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just got to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: See even the vegetarians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course vegetarians know what's up
with a good batch of beans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a Facebook post the other day
about, sorry, that microphone stands a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, about if you know the smell of good,
or if you can tell good beans based on
[SPEAKER_04]: smell alone, you might be from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have that rich earthy
smell to them and not too salty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need more like a, like a Panera and
like, I don't know, just more of that
[SPEAKER_06]: style.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't even have a Qdoba here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little delis and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: A witch witch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokyo Joe's.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can go for that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Witch witches.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All kinds of free advertising for a bunch
of shitty restaurants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomato Joe's in Pueblo on, I think that's
main street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I eat there?
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a place I could eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a veggie sandwich for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's just, Oh, your mic is totally
getting away from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just going to rock star.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that how you do it on the Colorado
podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to dance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize for the thing going limp on
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a couple of veggie sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right by the library.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go eat there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put this train wreck back on a,
on a, on some rails here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not bring 44 sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't bring 44.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not allowed to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the exclusion zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: When, when is that done?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: We missed you bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't wait till you come out and play
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jesse wanted to talk about something
that I find to be really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: That people don't realize people want to
jump into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: People move from all over the country to
Colorado, to Washington, to California,
[SPEAKER_06]: to Oregon, to Michigan, to all these
places that were cannabis growing is
[SPEAKER_06]: legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they show up here and they have either
grown in their basement and in a legal
[SPEAKER_06]: state for a couple of years and had two or
three lights, or they set up a small grow
[SPEAKER_06]: here in their garage or their basement and
they run four or six lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they think I'm going to open a
big ass grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're either going to do it
legally or illegally.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to get permits or not,
or maybe they're just going to do this in
[SPEAKER_06]: an illegal place.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been growing in their basement for
a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're out there in the sticks in
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're like, f**k it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to buy that old meat plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to hang us up a hundred
blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe they do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the mistake that a lot of these people
f**k up is they don't realize that going
[SPEAKER_06]: from the basement to a large grow
facility, it's not just taking this much
[SPEAKER_06]: air conditioning and multiplying at times,
however, more or many lights you're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You run into a whole new s**t stew of
problems when you start going to big scale
[SPEAKER_06]: growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The humidity is ridiculously hard to
control in a large room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard as s**t to remove a lot of
humidity in a very large room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also hard to regulate the temperature
and the airflow and the CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of tricks to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the biggest mistake you see people
make when they go from when a dude goes
[SPEAKER_06]: and just builds his first big one,
when new people get their OPC license and
[SPEAKER_06]: they can build a grow, where do they f**k
up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always air conditioning, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And humidity never even gets considered
because they think this is the desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is the desert, but they think
it's not going to be an issue because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: so dry here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bunch of BS.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to go pumping water into
those plants every single day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they transpire.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are thousand watt lights,
a bunch of them right above those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the water wants to come out and go up
toward those lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it hangs out up by the ceiling
and then it falls back down and then it
[SPEAKER_06]: hangs out and it gets between two leaves
and it festers for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you know what it does?
[SPEAKER_06]: It turns into a f**king powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: The spores are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just starts flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just waiting for you to give it the
prime tradition.
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole grow room is the perfect
condition for bugs and f**king funguses
[SPEAKER_06]: and problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the air conditioning and the humidity
are always definitely the first thing that
[SPEAKER_06]: I think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A big grow room is a living organism that
is full of lots of other smaller living
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was explaining it to a buddy this way
earlier today and it itself has special
[SPEAKER_04]: care that needs done to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just the plants inside of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got 85 lights in the flower room at
Green and Healthy and we run 50 tons and
[SPEAKER_06]: we've got a 30 in the middle and two 10s
on the opposite sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 tons of air conditioning to cool that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got three air, see that's smart,
three air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If one goes down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got two backups that can kind of,
if the 30 goes down, it gets warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: But luckily we're running Gavitas with the
Gavita master controller.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you tell it that if it gets above 86 in
here, I want you to dim the lights until
[SPEAKER_06]: it gets back down to 77 and then you can
go back up if you need to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That Gavita master controller is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to run two of them because we have
so many lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, they're so easy to program
that it doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're 50 lights each, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they only do 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to do 50 because we're on 85
lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nanos do 199 each.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what sucks about that is you
still might have to buy multiple units if
[SPEAKER_04]: they're in different rooms because you
can't break them into zones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily our room is one 85 light big giant
open room with like six rows of madness in
[SPEAKER_06]: it right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to my friends at Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are growing on a small scale,
a medium scale or a large scale and you
[SPEAKER_06]: want nutrients to push your garden and you
want to see what you can really do,
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking Veg Bloom is something I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far I'm six, no, I'm seven weeks in
and this is the best grow I've done at the
[SPEAKER_06]: Green and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a run right next to it that
was not Veg Bloom and I've already passed
[SPEAKER_06]: the size of those buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're being harvested at week nine and
these other buds are at week seven and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're already bigger than the week nine
buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I support Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do three.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the only place you could go
from your last performance.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time we crushed it, we did pretty
damn well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the boys at Green and Healthy
Wellness and the whole Terp Jungle for
[SPEAKER_06]: helping me out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even shout out to the new guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not enough air conditioning and then
nobody considers getting rid of the
[SPEAKER_06]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: There needs to be an exit for all of the
moisture that comes into the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be filling the room with CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: But where is all of that old stagnant air
going that's in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get rid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to be in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you walk into the grow room and it
feels funky to you, it feels funky to the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be able to close your eyes and
breathe and not notice that you've walked
[SPEAKER_06]: into a grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should just feel like normal,
like this living room right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Swamp cooler going, it's a little funky in
here, but it's like 90 something degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: today, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things I've noticed, like we were talking
earlier, foliar spraying, even just
[SPEAKER_04]: watering, brewing a damn tea, brewing 200
gallons of tea can spike the humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get that 200 gallons of tea too close
to the whites and it just starts
[SPEAKER_06]: evaporating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It heats up the tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then all that moisture in the room carries
heat and heats up the room as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go through the hot and cold cycles
naturally through the day, the building
[SPEAKER_04]: getting heated up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, most of these grows are in fairly
thin-shelled commercial warehouses that
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't insulated as well as they could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get the heating and cooling effect
from just the natural outside temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to build a concrete wall on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to fur it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the construction term,
we had to fur a wall out six inches with
[SPEAKER_06]: concrete to kind of insulate ourselves a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only person that might have to
do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The east wall of our facility,
the west wall of the facility,
[SPEAKER_04]: the way it all sits as the sun starts
going down, it just bakes it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The wall goes from being in the 70s all
the way up into it's radiating heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see those waves coming off when
you go outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ours was the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the winter came, it got so cold on
that wall that we could see moisture on
[SPEAKER_06]: the inside of the wall.
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wall is going to do that too if we
don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your wall is going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll get a PM issue because you're
introducing moisture right there and that
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature fluctuation near that wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn everything the damn hard way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't have it any other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have seen the guys that did the
concrete over the front of the building.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were three dudes that didn't speak
much English.
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed up in a truck with a truck,
a wheelbarrow, a whole bunch of cement and
[SPEAKER_06]: some janky scaffolding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two dudes carried the scaffolding to where
they needed to be and they just pointed
[SPEAKER_06]: and grunted a couple of times,
right here, right here, right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They set up the first level and then one
dude climbed that and they threw parts to
[SPEAKER_06]: him while he was standing on the
scaffolding and he stuck him in place and
[SPEAKER_06]: then climbed up that and hung and grabbed
other shit and built a four-story scaffold
[SPEAKER_06]: by himself, climbed up and down it like a
spider monkey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They start the cement from the top and let
it run down and he's up on the top of the
[SPEAKER_06]: scaffolding and he yells, uno.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy on the bottom is mixing cement in
a wheelbarrow with those little trowel
[SPEAKER_06]: things in his hand and he puts a pile on
the thing and he doesn't throw the tool,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he throws the concrete, just chucks it
up into the air between the scaffolding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the dude up top puts his trowel down,
doesn't even look, catches that fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: cement on it and smears it on the wall
like Daniel's son.
[SPEAKER_06]: Left, right, left, right, left,
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he yells, dos.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the guy throws two of them up and he
puts both of his little tools down and
[SPEAKER_06]: catches both of them and smears it on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's running left and right and just
yelling, uno, dos, as he gets to the
[SPEAKER_06]: middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the guy throws how many he needs and
he just keeps fucking smearing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as it's coming down, he goes to the
top and pushes it down and then jumps to
[SPEAKER_06]: the next level and repeats.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they got it all done and went
back and smoothed it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took these three dudes, seriously two
hours to do the entire front of this
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking building, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hire those guys for fucking
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck you, Trump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard working motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know my background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked in the construction industry for
over a decade and there's a reason why
[SPEAKER_04]: there's not that many white guys employed
in the construction industry anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, take that Trump.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, Trump.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with hiring some
illegals to come do some construction
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do the shit that white people think
they're too good to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't pay me enough to do some of
the shit that some of those guys would do
[SPEAKER_06]: just to make enough money to send home to
their family.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Asphalt and black tar roofing,
I do draw the line there without a doubt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fucking white as this paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want me on a roof.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, any kind of roofing I draw the
line at, to be honest, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to get air conditioning and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to have an exit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to have a vent drawing stale air
out of the building and getting it out of
[SPEAKER_06]: the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something super important when
you're going from a basement grow to a
[SPEAKER_06]: larger commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys have to run carbon filters?
[SPEAKER_06]: We should be, but we're allowed one more
complaint before we get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's economics.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fine is cheaper than the filters that
we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we had to here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the immediately those,
like one of their big concerns was carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: filters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got six of those big fuckers all
over ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've even got the inline ones on our air
cooled lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're disgustingly lucky because across
the street from us is homeward bound dog
[SPEAKER_06]: crematorium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so every day around noon, you smell
garlic bread and then you realize they're
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking cooking animals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Across the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a dead animal being cremated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I told the new guy, we got a new guy
and I smelled it the other day and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: like, Oh, I can't even let him do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I walked into the other room where he
wasn't go, Hey bro, you smell that garlic
[SPEAKER_06]: bread?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he goes, yeah, who's cooking?
[SPEAKER_06]: I go, that's the dog crematorium next
door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't enjoy it too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Rover.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he just looked at me like,
that's, he said, that's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just roasting that motherfucker,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny because the first few days
I worked there, I smelled something and
[SPEAKER_06]: there were two girls that used to work
there that are no longer affiliated with
[SPEAKER_06]: us, but they used to work there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd be like every day at like noon
or two o'clock, I smelled garlic bread and
[SPEAKER_06]: they were standing in the grow room,
just sucking it in one day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, where is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once I realized what it was a few days
later, I was like, those girls were loving
[SPEAKER_06]: the smell of burnt puppies, fried kittens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: This podcast just got really morbid.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason I brought it up is just carbon
filter systems in a home grow versus a
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drastically different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hugely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I said what we need is way
expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need like HIPAA filter grade shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: UV lighting possibly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a small UV light that I use on
small plantlings.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run it over, I just walk through the
grow room and just hover that light about
[SPEAKER_06]: four to six inches over every little
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it keeps them nice and bug free
because the bugs want nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PM, there is not any.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that thing is helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was using that on another guy's garden
that had bad PM.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it took eight days to just
deteriorate all the PM.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know an old guy that has not enough
fucking filtration or refuses to blow the
[SPEAKER_06]: air out of his house because he's afraid
and he keeps getting PM.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they keep learning new tricks on how to
get rid of it for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: It keeps us on our toes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So filtration is something that you super
definitely need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that stale funky air out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to need UV lighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to need HIPAA filtration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your air conditioners have exchanges.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to pull the air from the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to blow back into your
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also a large portion of that is going
to escape into the outside atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to be stinking it up that
way also.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need carbon scrubbers inside the
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty fucking hard to keep the
smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we didn't have a... And they came to us
and they're like, hey, we can smell
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, yeah, we would try to keep
the smell down.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you know it's us?
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, well, we've been to all the
other grows and you guys seem to know more
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave us a compliment.
[SPEAKER_06]: The NED in the city loves us because we're
friends with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we don't hide from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some dispensary owners that
don't get along with those people because
[SPEAKER_06]: they're shifty dicks and they're just
keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're trying to be on the legit side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they come over and we're like,
hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually... I'm looking forward to our
first visit because the place I work at
[SPEAKER_04]: now is completely different than some of
the other places I've worked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice when you can look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they'll have some issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they will.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're always going to, that's their job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not scared of anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that we have messed up on it's
either because we didn't understand it
[SPEAKER_06]: properly or... Invite the department of
agriculture in for a walkthrough,
[SPEAKER_06]: like invite them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you invite them, they won't
give you any violations for whatever they
[SPEAKER_06]: find.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll tell you to correct it since you
invited them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll be like, you've got 90 days to
get it corrected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we come back, that's when we'll
actually be able to put you on like a
[SPEAKER_06]: warning notice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you invite them, they show up and
they're like, oh, good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can be like, I need help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come show me what to correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of the way to do it with
the department of ag and the guy that's
[SPEAKER_06]: been going around is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of his name right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I can almost remember his name in my
head, but he's a cool little dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an older dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's kind of a short guy, but he's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's fun to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very informative, very educational.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'll talk to you like you're a human.
[SPEAKER_06]: He won't treat you like a stupid grower,
like some of the industry people do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like electricians and HVAC guys trying to
talk to us like we're fucking retarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: HVAC guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was dealing with one yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about ready to strangle the guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had to walk out of the office.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, you're fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes, sometimes some contractors are
a pain in the ass to deal with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're building your big grow,
find some contractors that you can trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Pueblo, good fucking luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado,
you'd be better off paying crews from
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver to come down and build your grow,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gagliano.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a good builder?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's very connected in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows he's on first name basis with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shit goes pretty smoothly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're trying to get a grow built in
Colorado, in the Pueblo, Colorado region,
[SPEAKER_06]: find a guy who does construction by the
name of Gagliano.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gagliano's construction in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you contact them, be like,
hey, I was listening to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy named Rasta Jeff told me about
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anything that we do business with,
you owe him 2% commission and just make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that he sends me 2%.
[SPEAKER_06]: 2% is not a lot to ask for.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's very small.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 2%.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you got a dollar, you'd give me,
if you had a dollar in change,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's why I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: If he was in coins on the floor,
you wouldn't care if I picked up two
[SPEAKER_06]: pennies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, not a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two pennies, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you got to break a buck, I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's breaking the big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you got the soft, the soft hundred
pennies, I could take two of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find yourself a good contractor is the
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of all this.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause contractors can fuck up your whole
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked in another facility that the
blueprint was drawn by one guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The HVAC system was designed by another in
the electrical, which we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was designed by another guy and they
were all, it was like we took a Ferrari
[SPEAKER_06]: engine, maybe a Porsche turbo kit,
and then maybe like a Lamborghini body,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the suspension system for a
Corvette.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, you got all these dope
ass parts, make it go fast, Ricky Bobby.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like fucking, we're like, but the air
conditioning, doesn't work when you turn
[SPEAKER_06]: on all the lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's not enough power to do all of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, yeah, you need good
contractors, good engineers, a fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very key is an engineer that
understands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you're not always going to find a
contractor that understands indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand how much humidity is
coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rarely will find a contractor that
understands it, but you can find engineers
[SPEAKER_04]: that know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And engineers are smart people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can explain shit to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's, that was real key in the
uncle bud company development.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a really good engineer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'll let you give them a nice plug.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to write it down so that I
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to, uh, relay concerns I had
to, to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, you know, we got to make
sure this doesn't happen like electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, we, we just have to have
plenty of electricity, three phase power
[SPEAKER_06]: all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not quite, but we got two meters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many amps are you allowed to pull?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we were 400 on both.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on each box.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get 800 total amps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere near drawing full capacity at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of amperage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get to flip the fucking on switch?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got two inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever done it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it feel ridiculous when it,
when the contacts touch all that power?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you, if you're not strong enough
to push it all the way through,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, cause that's a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of freaking electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just gotta go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just push it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some smaller folks might not be able
to push that thing all the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a little wiry dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see Adam up there trying to push it
like Mickey Mouse all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam and 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam and D both.
[SPEAKER_04]: D on top trying to deal with his broken
hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stop it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the, uh, the Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't give me love.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another thing we kind of touched on
this one, get a fucking certified,
[SPEAKER_06]: qualified, reliable, professional
electrician.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your contractors do fuck up,
you can fire them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't just be like, you know, I hired this
guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to stick with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you fucking don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not dating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can call them on it and you can
make them come back and fix it or take
[SPEAKER_04]: away their junk and you're not going to
pay for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take away their junk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every contractor has got a pile of his
shit in your facility while he's working
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold it hostage until you get what the
fuck you need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that's kind of a fucked up way to go
about it, but if you just lock the door,
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't it like, bro, you done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: My walls are all crooked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make my wall street and then I'll pay you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to do shit, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The flooring flooring has always been a
bitch in every facility I've been to.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flooring has been an issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just hard to get floors right in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a brand name of specific paint
for you, but I don't know it off the top
[SPEAKER_04]: of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one little flake out of 2000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's had, it's had, uh, almost three
months of, of work on top of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you dropped something heavy to get
that one chip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The grid on your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a stainless steel table.
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew it was a table.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking knew it was a long ass hydro
table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like tables.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put your plants on tables, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Raise them up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get them up where you can work on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got ours on the floor right now and
that's something, uh, cleaning,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, mopping up after six plants,
12 plants is one thing mopping up after
[SPEAKER_04]: 176 plants is a completely different
story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got an assistant grower now and every
like few days he's like, what do you want
[SPEAKER_06]: me to do, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, just clean up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, seriously?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, just go fucking every
little random thing that's fallen out of a
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the perlite that's on a table or any
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a pair of scissors laying
around, go clean all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Measuring jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Start from the top in the flower room,
go all the way down.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's old trellis or old pots in
there from something that's been
[SPEAKER_06]: harvested, that's got to go sweep every
goddamn corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get out the shop vac.
[SPEAKER_06]: Suck up underneath all the weird random
little nooks and crannies that we got in
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that's not going to be used
doesn't need to be in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think like scissors and boxes of
material that shit should go in the
[SPEAKER_06]: storage room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Store that or put it right outside the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're fortunate enough to have a storage
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, put the broom and dust pan and trash
can outside the flower room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't have that in the flowering room
or the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simple little tasks that you don't even
think about doing in a small grow can
[SPEAKER_04]: literally take days in a big grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Defoliating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaving legs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaving legs and defoliating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Staking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys are all netting,
but I'm doing a big seed run, so that
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't really an option.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like double and triple layer trellising.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get crazy on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bend them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a guy that, a former employee
that would defoliate the entire room for
[SPEAKER_06]: an entire shift and he would do 10 five
gallon buckets full of leaves and he would
[SPEAKER_06]: push them down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you just chop leaves all day and then
go back and scoop up the leaves out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: trays into five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'd probably fill 10 five gallon
buckets.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd fill one of those big like 30 gallon
trash cans halfway full.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just leaves just from the first run of
defoliating.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is you don't have to do in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to weigh all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to track it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I hate that part of it so much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Document what all that shit weighed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Manicured weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even manicure it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just pulled the damn leaf off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a, you know how you're
supposed to like mix it with soil or
[SPEAKER_04]: vinegar, oil or something like that before
you can throw it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's, let's catch the listeners up
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a commercial grow, when you,
if you have, see maybe a bud isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: desirable or they're the bottom part of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I throw that shit away.
[SPEAKER_06]: When that's in the trash can, you have to
cut it up into little tiny pieces and then
[SPEAKER_06]: you have to mix it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Jesse said, with a soil or a kitty
litter is what they recommended or gravel
[SPEAKER_06]: or vinegar or something else that you can
put in their cooking oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything to make it unusable and
unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like you got a good idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got three worms.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Feed it to the worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're loving it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they love their can of meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use a shit ton of worm castings too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it helps cut down costs there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre-cycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when we get our greenhouse built.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a whole wall in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a shelf system full of
worm bins and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Worm shit and into a, into a funnel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a warm shit funnel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tunnel it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've, we grind it up pretty small.
[SPEAKER_06]: We chop it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I chopped it up with a, like the,
the shears just go ham on it with the
[SPEAKER_06]: shears.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we make lasagna.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically we take the old pot that the
plant's been harvested from and shake that
[SPEAKER_06]: soil into the trash can.
[SPEAKER_06]: We let them dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've all sat around and dried for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dump all that soil into the trash can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw a bunch of the waste into there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dump a couple more pots, more soil,
couple more pot or more waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep it like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a way to get rid of all of our
old soil at the same time and kind of be
[SPEAKER_06]: used to have a use for it instead of just
wasting all that good dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I know it's recyclable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally know I can use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we use so much cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: We buy 14 big bags of cocoa at a time when
we go, because that's what fits in Hunt's
[SPEAKER_06]: car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're talking like the big tall bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those bags that are right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The 1.75 cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are bigger than your average bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I, that's what I use at the
house now too is cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've upgraded.
[SPEAKER_06]: And shout out to, shout out to Way to
Grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope nobody just heard me burp into that
microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Way to Grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was buying cocoa grow the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked the botanic hair cocoa
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I prefer the aeration bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need that aeration in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Way to Grow was nice enough to throw
in a bunch of bags of Fox Farms ocean
[SPEAKER_06]: forest soil for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: They carried that shit to my car and
they're like, you buy a lot of shit here,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, fuck yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know exactly where that soil was going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to my friends at Way to Grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do listen to the podcast,
contact me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'd love to have you as a sponsor on
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of Jeff account.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know my account name and they laugh
every time they hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They laugh every time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we've got the commercial account and
the name of the account is really funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know the name now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They already know what to type in when I
walk up to the register.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you told me one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need a good fucking electrician.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a way to get rid of humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a way to get rid of heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need plenty of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to seal up all the cracks,
all the nooks and crannies.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to be able to clean the fuck out
of this place.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be a semi-clean facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want some old car garage where
the floor is all greasy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a floor drain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Floor drains are crucial.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And water, you need access to water.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of warehouses out in Pueblo by the
airport, they don't have water ran to them
[SPEAKER_06]: because they didn't need water for
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you get one of those warehouses out
there, sorry, just had to make sure it was
[SPEAKER_06]: on track here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get one of those warehouses out
there, you might not have water.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to be getting trucks
of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to pay to get water
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something people aren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get a large grow on private land
out, say in Pueblo County somewhere,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have to get water rights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because you have land doesn't mean
you're granted water rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if there's a well there, you have to
purchase water to offset what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: taking out of the office.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there are enough grows around that
area that that jurisdiction deems the
[SPEAKER_06]: water is compromised by you coming,
they can decline your water rights.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't have any water.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, I mean, even to the point that
they don't care that you're going to town
[SPEAKER_04]: to buy it and that you have a big truck,
it's sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you can't prove that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a side track with the Department
of Natural Resources now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone has any questions or anything,
you can hit me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Message our friend, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the great people that we meet.
[SPEAKER_06]: These people would never take you and I
seriously.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's got a semi ponytail, a beard,
fucking tattooed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got, is that a trout on your arm?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got, dude, I knew it was a fucking
trout.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a trout on his arm.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a Colorado flag.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a chili.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just one arm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he's got a Monarch butterfly and a
snowboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one arm.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's tatted up and I bet a lot of the,
and I'm six five with dreadlocks and red
[SPEAKER_06]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much a good, and a crooked
hat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wear Dickies every day cause I
destroy clothes and it's easier just to
[SPEAKER_06]: wear Dickies that are indestructible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these contractors and business folks
would never have taken us seriously before
[SPEAKER_06]: the scandalous industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I find it so funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've noticed when I go to restaurants in
Denver and I'm wearing like a,
[SPEAKER_06]: just a dad kid shirt, basically my Irish
shirt and my hat crooked and a pendee and
[SPEAKER_06]: skate shoes and my Dickies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I walk in red eyed before restaurants
would kind of be a dick to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd kind of be like, Oh, this guy's
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's fucking up our vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now there's always some young hip
waitress.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what's up guys at work in the
weed industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to tip the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want some great service, honey?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want, I don't want fancy things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a nice, some good hash and live
comfortably.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go to a lot of good shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go see the dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever they come around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go see fish every time they're
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you check out the dead company?
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the dead and co and it was fucking
rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: This most recent one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just this recent one when they're in
Boulder at Folsom field.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to see one of these shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you have to come with me one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to, I used to eat a bunch of
psychedelic drugs when I used to go to
[SPEAKER_06]: those shows and I've quit doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a head injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody that listens to the podcast for a
long time heard about the head injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a year and a half and I still
have effects from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I hate to admit it and talk about it,
but I still have like TBI.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got post-concussion syndrome and I've
got a traumatic brain injury still.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had, I played high school football at
very major concussions in high school and
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I didn't let them heal up
correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder sometimes how that affects
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever, you ever doing shit and you
go, Oh, that's from that time I hit my
[SPEAKER_06]: head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever have those moments?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have those moments where I wonder if
that's, you know, I just blame it on that
[SPEAKER_06]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yep, that's, that's from the
time I smacked myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now when I'm reaching to the left
for no reason and my jacket's to the
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is why that's from the time I smacked
my fucking head.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try to get back on track.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know where the fuck we were
talking about concussions and building
[SPEAKER_04]: grows large facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Large facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about needing water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water tanks, water filtration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your average on the shelf growth store
water filter can't handle the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: water that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you need a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use a thousand gallons of water every 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's 105 lights total.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing a hundred and fifty five to 165
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sea burst still not even at full
capacity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in full flower and I've got plants
that are five feet tall with big fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: donkey dick buds on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And either way, that's still a lot more
than your basement growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so much more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using, I figure you use about
indoors, you probably use five gallons of
[SPEAKER_06]: water per light every 48 to 72 hours ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way I used to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you guys are trying to figure out
how much water you should be using in your
[SPEAKER_06]: indoor, every 1000 watt or 600 watt light,
600, 1000 watt light, it should be running
[SPEAKER_06]: about five gallons every 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your temperatures and your humidity and
everything are dialed in and your plants
[SPEAKER_06]: are at their optimum growth, your plants
are growing a little slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're probably overwatering them.
I would agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's usually the first sign of
overwatering some plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be average.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say five gallons of plant per plant
per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Per day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when it gets super hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it okay to just turn on the hose and
just let the hose just fucking flood those
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to concentrate it more just around
the plant because I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: wasting, you know, just to conserve it
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you could totally do like a field
flood irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually know of a wholesale place here
in Pueblo County that floods their field
[SPEAKER_04]: just like they do with cantaloupe or,
you know, watermelon or anything.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just flood the whole field out,
let it soak and let it dry and reflood it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just doing a flood and drain outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they do it like two or three times
a season.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to go explore and visit more of
these outdoor cannabis and hemp grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see how you guys are doing a lot
of this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to learn from your tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see what I can implement into my
indoor tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can show you a couple of cool ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to see a bunch of big stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: The overwhelming majority of these places
are no-till raised bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no-till, you guys, they make an amended
soil with a lot of special amendments and
[SPEAKER_06]: then very specific amendments that I'm
ignorant to, honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what goes into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beneficial nights, warm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Live worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Live worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's living soil, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the plants are harvested.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you pull out the big root ball or
do you just leave that in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You pull out the stem around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually want to leave as much of the
root ball in there as you can because the
[SPEAKER_06]: worms are going to eat it, turn it back
into nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Life goes in circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pull the plant out and you put a new
one in and you send her off again.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use a lot of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're stacking stuff into the pot and
then the worms will eat all of that
[SPEAKER_06]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff will decompose and become
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then so you're going to start losing a
little bit of depth every time,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the depth of the soil is going to
move down and then you can just refill it
[SPEAKER_06]: with your fresh top.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you recharge no-till is you go
back and top dress in all your recharged
[SPEAKER_04]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's extremely economical.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why most of these places are
running out and they're such large scale
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's just- Do the plants taste good?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because being an indoor grower who uses
mainly bottled nutrients for most of my
[SPEAKER_06]: grow career, I've always been taught to
flush my plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they those guys that say, I don't need
to flush because I've been flushing the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that those guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So since they're not feeding a whole bunch
of bottled nutrients, a bunch of chelated
[SPEAKER_06]: salts, their plants aren't backed up with
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their plants are probably more able to,
I can't even remember the word right now,
[SPEAKER_06]: assimilate.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the nutrients that are going
through, they can use it a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes up and goes down.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get rid of it a little more.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of buffet style.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get to pick and choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of just being force fed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants actually finish themselves off.
[SPEAKER_04]: They start fading just like they would if
they're flushed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they know.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just like, Hey, my season's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see a difference in specific
strains?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does strain A versus strain B,
do they finish differently in the no-till
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done enough of it to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just curious if that was nutrients
running out or if that was actually the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant realizing, Hey, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm flushing myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know in my experience, the way I grow in
the grounds, kind of no-till pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Girl Scout Cookies and Flow will
finish themselves off without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Forum Cook Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flow will finish herself off you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been going for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start wrapping it up because I'm
actually expecting dinner to show up in
[SPEAKER_06]: the next 20 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started thinking about that about
15 minutes ago too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you messing with your phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, he's dealing with his dinner.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, Hey, I'll be there in 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, give us 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got to go foliar spray some
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to spray?
[SPEAKER_04]: Essential oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pesticide, pest management,
integrated pesticide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pest management with essential oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are to 13 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just about the end of that spray period
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lights just shut off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go and I'm with it a few
more times and get in there with that
[SPEAKER_06]: green light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you wear the forehead green light or do
you have a room light?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I got the forehead one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the full room ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inevitably that light switch always
gets left on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't notice it when all the other
lights are on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's just running that green light for
nothing all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little CFL.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the green light on my head because
then it's looking where I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually focused where I am instead
of just, then you don't get shadows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shadow myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the lights from behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked a lot about building,
getting your large commercial grow going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any things that you want to
add before we start wrapping this up so
[SPEAKER_06]: that I don't cut off any of your useful
data for our listeners?
[SPEAKER_04]: Find a person that can be vouched for by
many people throughout the community to
[SPEAKER_04]: work with your engineer, to help design
your building and pay him what he is
[SPEAKER_04]: worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, if it'll be a guy like me
or Jeff, and even if he's not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow for you, pay him what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your end product will drastically
improve and work better by doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my first week in green and healthy
wellness, I made minor improvements.
[SPEAKER_06]: They improved the financial, it just made
sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fixed their books a little bit just by
fucking doing a couple of adjustments,
[SPEAKER_06]: like making the garden more profitable
just by eliminating this and adding this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just took me a week to make a whole
bunch of small improvements just because
[SPEAKER_06]: the person who set it up and was running
it was not an experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to bash this person,
but they weren't a forward thinker.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't look far enough into the
future.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have foresight to realize that
if I don't put glue here, this shit's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to come apart eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I fixed a lot of just small details.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have any heaters in the,
so it was winter when I started,
[SPEAKER_06]: there were no heaters in the reservoirs
and they're feeding the plants 54 degree
[SPEAKER_06]: water and they couldn't get the pH of the
fucking water to come up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just pouring in pH.
[SPEAKER_06]: They couldn't get it to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just pouring in like a half a
gallon of pH down and like, it won't move.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I stuck my hand in there and I was
like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go, where does the water come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes to the hose.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Oh, so municipal water,
it's coming from the fucking line.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's underground and it's 30 degrees
outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I stuck a thermometer in there and that
water was 54 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, well, that's why the pH won't
move.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why the plants have the claw.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all had the fucking downward claw,
but the plants were purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everything was purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were happy about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so I put aquarium heaters in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, let's go to the fish store and
get the biggest aquarium heaters they have
[SPEAKER_06]: put two in each one, set them at 74
degrees and let them run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get the glass ones or like the
stainless stills?
[SPEAKER_04]: The glass ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: They work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I learned that they sell big R cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're for heating animal like horse
trotters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stock tank heaters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those would have been more economical,
but I didn't think of that because I'm not
[SPEAKER_06]: a farm boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ordered in a couple at the store last
winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been selling the glass ones and I
had found the stainless steel ones and
[SPEAKER_04]: they sold them up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid that glass one's going to break
and they're on accident somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in thousand gallons.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in 50 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someday it will, but yeah, they fell safe
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not going to get shocked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not in there right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's summertime.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I took those motherfuckers out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, a lot of the shit you're going
to go spend money on at the hydro store,
[SPEAKER_06]: go check out the aquarium store before you
do that because it's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even Granger, to be totally honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't always have to buy all your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big R has a lot of very useful shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The normal grow store, not the hydroponic
store, but like the local garden supply
[SPEAKER_06]: center has a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Home Depot and Lowe's and Target have a
lot of good shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just do not buy nutrients, soil,
anything that is going to be consumed by
[SPEAKER_06]: you or your plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't purchase that at Home Depot,
Lowe's or Target.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only accessories made out of plastic or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of grow store specific still
at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hobby Lobby sells Fiskars scissors for
$12.99 as opposed to Home Depot and
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere else is $19.99.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little titanium tip, Fiskars trim
scissors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I do them cheaper than that,
but I'm not sure.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Hygro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're $9.99 that row, we'll go get
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: One Love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget that you guys change your names.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not as involved with the store anymore
as I was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the wife now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always been the wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's her baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: She does a good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just in Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I were there, I'd shop there,
but I'm right up the street from the store
[SPEAKER_06]: in Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I needed 14 bags of soil, I don't know
that you'd have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays we probably would.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Commercial orders are a little... That's
something we should mention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Commercial ordering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck the first time you want to
figure out how much fucking soil you need
[SPEAKER_06]: to fill all those pots because that's a
math challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard Jesse and I sit here and try to
figure out how much soil we needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to go back to the
store a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't expect...
[SPEAKER_04]: At all stores, you're going to be able to
get commercial quantities of things when
[SPEAKER_04]: you need them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to think ahead about stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have to start letting... We let
the store near us know that these are
[SPEAKER_06]: products that we use on the regular.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you keep these stocks, we'll buy them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we come here and you don't have it,
we will drive directly to another store
[SPEAKER_06]: and get it because we don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it took them a couple of rhythms.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took them a couple, hey, you don't have
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, it's coming Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: The trucks come Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we compromised with the... We can't
fuck with the day the trucks run.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some shit we can't ask for.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get it on your next order.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring it on the previous order.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are ordering a truckload of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a truck of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two main truckers that they
literally move, I would say, 60 to 70% of
[SPEAKER_04]: the gross supplies sold in gross stores
all across Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all open down the front range.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Gary and James.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's probably one warehouse
that gets fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three main warehouses in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it just gets distributed from
there out to Pueblo Springs, Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a company named Denver Air is one of
the only delivery companies that will work
[SPEAKER_04]: from Denver South on a daily route.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go to Way to Grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go to Grow Generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go to all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to Grow is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going big, they're going big
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in Pueblo and you want to buy
stuff for your small grow, definitely hit
[SPEAKER_06]: One Love.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if your big, huge, gigantic county
greenhouse grow, we already deal with a
[SPEAKER_04]: handful of half a dozen clients out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know what it takes to service big grows
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're in Pueblo and you're out
there in the county, go hit them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know if they were able to handle
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll get you a commercial account
going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drop shipping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to semi-pull up to your
farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just drop off loads of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so much fun watching people carry all
your shit in for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Jesse said, he said to hire somebody
that knows what the fuck they're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about when it comes to working with your
engineer to build the grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something super important that just sounds
egotistical coming from myself and Jesse,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also hire a master grower that is a
master grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interview people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at pictures of plants they've grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought people to my home grow to show
them that I can grow on a commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, here is what I can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put me in a big grow, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they trusted me and they gave me the
opportunity by seeing the cleanliness and
[SPEAKER_06]: the organization of my home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can go look at their grow before
you hire a master grower, do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're the business guy and you
think you're going to grow it yourself and
[SPEAKER_06]: be professional, you're going to fuck it
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got faith in your skills.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got faith in your mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: But cannabis is something that takes a lot
of practice to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like playing an instrument.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have natural skill, but you're
not going to be Bon Jovi the first time
[SPEAKER_06]: you grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to fucking practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to tour a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to have 10 cycles
under your belt before you even think
[SPEAKER_06]: about going big.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full cycles from clone all the way to
drying and curing all the way to moving
[SPEAKER_06]: the packs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot to figure out.
[SPEAKER_04]: My boss gets, or my head owner,
he gets down and dirty in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has this like child like excitement
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never, well, I know Hunt,
he gets down in the grow room too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hunt packs lots for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hunt comes in at six in the morning on a
certain, on Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hunt will be there at six in the morning
and I'll come in a couple of few hours
[SPEAKER_06]: later and he'll have a hundred pots filled
with soil being like, Hey, you can get all
[SPEAKER_06]: those transplants done today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you a head start.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, hell yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he sweeps.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sweeps the entire facility if I need
him to.
[SPEAKER_06]: He takes out trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's like, bro, you're not here to
take out trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're here to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go grow cannabis for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a below your pay grade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that doesn't feel fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm not too good to clean the
shitters and take out trash, but you're
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should be hands on with the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels good though to have, to work for
people that realize you don't want to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that stuff that you would do it,
but you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it feels good for them to,
you know, tell you don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_04]: about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy that part.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the time I get the giant facility
all to myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just put on headphones and yeah,
which makes me feel like sometimes I got
[SPEAKER_06]: to clean the shitters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to sweep the floors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind doing it for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I go take a shit, I clean the
shitter when I'm done, because I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to be that guy leaving a hot seat and
some streaks for the next guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like rinsing your plate as soon as
you're done eating.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking some Windex right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just hose that bitch down and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: For people that don't know much about the
industry or don't live in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is not common at all to find owners
that are actually involved in the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's I think me and Jeff are both
fortunate to work for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it's equally as common to
find rich dudes that own Porsche
[SPEAKER_06]: dealerships and want to double their
fucking money by opening a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_06]: being a dickhead to everybody and don't
know anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very similar stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very similar guys that just want to double
up because they have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they, so, and that's where my talk
about hire a real master grower loops
[SPEAKER_06]: around.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people want to hire their cousin
because they want to give their cousin a
[SPEAKER_06]: job or their nephew or their fucking
brother-in-law because he grew weed in the
[SPEAKER_04]: seventies and he talks a good game.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your investment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cost you a million bucks to
get your, your grow and your dispensary
[SPEAKER_06]: going easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 600,000 for, to get started.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you need like another 400 for
some payroll and whatever pops up and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to need a lawyer and an
accountant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for a small, small facility,
our little facility, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So unless you trust your fucking cousin,
a million bucks worth, your future is on
[SPEAKER_06]: the line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your business is on the line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your grows on the line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us growers are weird people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been taught to hide this for so many
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guys that are good at it did it like
when we were hiding it and we were kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: sketchy about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes some of our background
history on the application is a little
[SPEAKER_06]: vague.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we've got a big furry ass beard.
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have squirrels hiding in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you got dreadlocks down to your
ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have the whole damn zoo hiding
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't, we don't like sharing secrets.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't like to share too many secrets
and give out too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been fucked over before.
[SPEAKER_06]: By dispensary owners, by street people,
by friends, by family, things have gone
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're a little, we're a little
protective of ourselves and our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard my boss say it the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growers are some of the only people in the
industry that don't actually need a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could go make their own money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say this, but I actually need my
job.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made more money being a black market
grower than I ever have in the legal
[SPEAKER_06]: industry, but I don't have to look over my
shoulder anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to, when I hear ruffling
outside the front door too early,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think the door is about to get
kicked the fuck in because I spent plenty
[SPEAKER_06]: of years of my life just wondering is
today the day they kick this fucker in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a loan for a car.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a loan for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard work, but it can get done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brand new car in the driveway that I
couldn't have done when I was a street
[SPEAKER_06]: hustler because now I've got paychecks and
pay studs and I pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I pay child support because I've
got a child that lives with their mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just because we don't live in the same
place, I'm required to fucking pay child
[SPEAKER_06]: support, which is cool with me instead of
just driving it over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to go through a system which
documents it being paid.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were always on my ass about my
income.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're paying child support, but we want
to know where your money comes from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, why does it matter if the
bill gets paid?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kept telling them like,
my mom pays it or my grandpa died.
[SPEAKER_06]: He left me money and just fucking told him
that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I'm like, Hey, look, I work at
this place and like, okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so having a job, not looking over my
shoulder is well worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the stress reduction, although
there's other stress that comes from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I can be, I am more proud of my
grow now than I was when I was a black
[SPEAKER_06]: market grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was kind of cool having that thing
in the basement that nobody knew about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would disappear for fucking 12 hours
at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be like, where have you,
what have you been doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trimming weed, but I can't tell
you guys that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just went home and took a nap.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hire yourself a master grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: We may look like weirdos.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be tatted up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get yourself somebody that's on fucking
time, somebody that doesn't drink and do
[SPEAKER_06]: some drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've had some problems in the past
with employees that have recently hired
[SPEAKER_06]: that one guy was a party too hard the
night before and was too drunk to come to
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I had another guy that ate too
many mushrooms the night before and
[SPEAKER_06]: tripped way too hard and had a headache
and couldn't come to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a job to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I rely on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants rely on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't show up and water those
plants, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't show up on time and a pump
died overnight, because pumps die,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're fired.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole garden's dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fucking fired.
[SPEAKER_06]: There goes your million dollar investment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hire yourself a real master grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody that knows what they're doing,
not just your cousin.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might look like weirdos.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be introverts.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we're on time, we show initiative,
we're dedicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to be a soldier.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to be dedicated to the grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to respect the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to be able to build a relationship
with the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need somebody you can communicate
with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone that can multitask.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone that can deal with a contractor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone that's not going to be a dick when
the electrician shows up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone that's not going to run out the
back door and med shows up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you know what you do when med shows
up?
[SPEAKER_06]: You hand them all the compliance binders
with all your info and you tell them to
[SPEAKER_06]: have a good day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they get to sit there and figure out
what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can't come in and check until
they tell you they need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just hand them those compliance binders
and wait for them to find an issue.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go back to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, I'm not the owner,
so you can't even tell me shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll call the owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just call the owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Med's here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing my job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like we've gone a long way in this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're an hour and 15 minutes in,
but there's a lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_06]: This podcast was everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what the news was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps?
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Terps are awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the news.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, Terps are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps on Terps?
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps all day long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Terp suite and all those
kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got one more thing written down on my
paper of notes that we need to talk about,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it is the Uncle Bud Company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me all about the Uncle Bud Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uncle Bud Company is the company I'm
employed by.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a grow and a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got an MIP and an OPC.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's MIPs of Licensed to Make Cash in
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medically infused products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana infused products.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use a CO2 extraction method.
[SPEAKER_04]: Primarily, we make vape, or when we
started off, the company's still new.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're evolving.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started off with CO2 oil, vape pin
refills, and cartridges.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bringing out a line of edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going through testing and approval,
which is a bit of a process right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: but those will be on store shelves soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll also be bringing a ... I don't
know how I can state it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bringing a fractional distillate
product that's similar to a product called
[SPEAKER_04]: Clear to the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll be bringing our version of
Terpenes to the rec market too.
[SPEAKER_06]: This distillate is the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read the label on the distillate
that I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is raw distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is total potential cannabinoids,
94.1% TH cannabinoids total, and then it's
[SPEAKER_06]: broken down CBD 1.1% THC 90.94% THC in
this distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just taking rotovap and everything,
and pulling out the terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_06]: pulling out the cannabinoids, and making
them into separate products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another process in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't cover all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It involves something named after a farm
animal.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really vague.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said that you had edibles being tested
that would be coming out in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those only going to be available at
the Uncle Bud company, or are those going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be available at recreational and or
medical shops statewide?
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a storefront as of yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much easier that way.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our CO2 oil right now, I know here in
Pueblo it's available at The Spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also available at The Spot in
Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your CO2 oil that you guys made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a recreational product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: The edible products we're coming up with
at the moment, we've got a barbecue sauce
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going through the proving process.
[SPEAKER_04]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barbecue sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, the people that own my company are
from Georgia and Texas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are going to be high as fuck
because barbecue sauce is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dude, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many milligrams of THC per serving?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the thing we're figuring
out right now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a bottle's got to be limited at a
hundred milligrams, so it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller bottle.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it'll be like two servings,
so 50 milligrams per serving.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're going to make some ribs,
you can just squirt the whole bottle
[SPEAKER_06]: across some ribs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the heat when you're cooking the ribs
going to fuck up my medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the things we've got to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, there's a whole, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a vegetarian, you guys, so I'm just
hypothetically talking about barbecued
[SPEAKER_06]: ribs over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea of the proving process the
state requires for a new style edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rigorous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're doing popcorn bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, popcorn balls are huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some popcorn balls that were coated
in clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dude, that was high.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a part of the, a lot of our demand
we've been getting for clear right now is
[SPEAKER_04]: coming from edibles manufacturers because
they don't want any smell or any taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it so much easier and it's more
viscous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easier to work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not chunky like BHO.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a higher percentage, so it's easier
to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easier to redo the math and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Less goes further.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shot it to my friends at TNT
Extractions.
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave me a 1000 milligram chocolate
bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of like biting into,
it tastes like, they told me that there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a gram and a half of shatter melted into
that chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tasted like they just took a gram and a
half of shatter into a chocolate bar and
[SPEAKER_06]: just dropped the shatter directly into the
chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when I bit into it, it was
chocolate, chocolate, chocolate,
[SPEAKER_06]: hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just like, and I had to chew
through the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like, okay, chocolate again,
chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the hash was like, my teeth,
you know when you take a dab and your lips
[SPEAKER_06]: get sticky?
[SPEAKER_06]: My teeth were like, they're making this
noise.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I pull them apart, they'd sound like,
when I pulled them apart, they would do
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, damn, I'm hashy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got so high that I made a list of things
to do because I went to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate it and went to fucking work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a list of shit to do and I would
read on the list, water plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd walk to the water and turn on the
hose and be like, what was I about to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was I going to water some plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what was about to happen,
but I haven't eaten any edibles since that
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a little bit leery of edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an incident a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear some action at the front door.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's wrap up this podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you for coming and doing an
hour and 20 minute podcast with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to Bern for letting me borrow your
husband for an hour and a half and taking
[SPEAKER_06]: some dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Uncle Bud company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I'm going to wrap up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming, Jesse.

Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you make it in?
[SPEAKER_06]: She made it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to go so quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's food here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.

[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get you on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how to do that?

[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need help, I will get you on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get this podcast on iTunes
because iTunes is a place most people
[SPEAKER_06]: listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stitcher is number two, iTunes is number
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you'll really see your comments and
shit will come in on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least we're not just stuck on
SoundCloud now, which is probably number
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 or 14.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I can't listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even have SoundCloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on my phone, so I'd have to go through
your Facebook post and then use the link,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then it was just a pain in the- and
then if I get a call, then I have to start
[SPEAKER_06]: the episode over and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I use SoundCloud for is
just to check our show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's as soon as we're on stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played with your statistics yet,
your metrics on Stitcher?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get too attached to it, but it's fun
to go look and see what your ranking is
[SPEAKER_06]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first night I kind of looked at it,
but it didn't have any info.
