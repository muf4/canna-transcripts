[SPEAKER_00]: I emailed Sabrina Fendrick from BPG who's
not into the dynamic delivery thing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, Sabrina mostly wins dynamic
delivery battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hand wrote it on it and then I sent
it off to her, cracked her up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we do in our free time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're MedMen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be excited for dynamic
delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not MedMen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sold that Emoryville license.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold a license to MedMen,
but they're separate, independent,
[SPEAKER_00]: license separation but they weren't using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it was an operational
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but it was a license that they applied
for with the advocacy that BPG is known
[SPEAKER_01]: for with the city and then got MedMen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not entirely sure how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both Canarex subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hate from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She provides a different service than I
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm excited for that red box
competition up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're coming anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to happen with or without
objection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would love to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: MedMen can answer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no Beverly Hills store location,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to talk about Department of
Consumer Affairs and not confusing
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beverly Hills has a ban, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say my store location is in
Beverly Hills with a permit issued by the
[SPEAKER_01]: city of Los Angeles, would that be
confusing to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's Beverly Hills post office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some friends that live in
Beverly Hills as far as their mail is
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned, but they're an unincorporated
LA County and there's lots of pockets of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, sure, but I don't think the
confusion to the consumer about what city
[SPEAKER_00]: they're purchasing their cannabis in
matters so long as it's a compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're telling them they're buying one
thing and giving them something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: the BCC is more confused with someone
being confused that the bottle of infused
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity liquid is being marketed as wine as
opposed to their concern with them saying
[SPEAKER_00]: their store is in Beverly Hills when
technically they're probably Beverly Hills
[SPEAKER_00]: post office and it's unincorporated LA
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they can't be in unincorporated LA
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a city of LA permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's a piece of LA city that pokes
into Beverly Hills and uses their post
[SPEAKER_00]: office or whatever they want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, you want to arm
yourselves as the most compliant operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that you would want to...
They're a marketer first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's why they also have a
dispensary on Fifth Ave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because that's the most
profitable location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are companies that are going to
go with the like, let's go slow and roll
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's companies like them that are
going to go big and loud and different,
[SPEAKER_00]: different business plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see how that develops,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When the American money comes into the
American market, I am excited for the SEC
[SPEAKER_01]: filing discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not traded on the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When all those companies that American
money comes, it's going to be a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: market change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, without a question.
Thank you.
Thank you.
