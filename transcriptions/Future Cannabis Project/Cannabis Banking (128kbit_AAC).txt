[SPEAKER_02]: The conversation we didn't really complete
is one on banking, and that's why it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasure here to have Tim Schaefer with
us, the California Deputy Treasurer of
[SPEAKER_02]: Public Finance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to share with everyone what one
company wrote me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is Bloombox, and these folks
provide B2B software as products and
[SPEAKER_02]: service.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said legalization didn't help us
with investment capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's no way to safely bank or
insure these investment funds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller investors cannot incur risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Larger V-type, VC-type investors are still
bound by so-called vice clauses commonly
[SPEAKER_02]: embedded in their partnership agreements
that prohibit even indirect investments in
[SPEAKER_02]: federally scheduled substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this really and strictly a schedule one
issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: A complex question with an equally complex
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking, many businesses, is a question of
a banker being able to engage in
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable risk management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you an example that has
nothing to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many banks will refuse to open accounts
for check cashing services, for horse
[SPEAKER_00]: racing tracks, for payday auto lenders,
for card rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because often these organizations can mask
occult activities which will create
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory risk for the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they avoid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, notice that it's perfectly legal to
be in the card room business or to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: horse racing track, assuming you've got
licenses from your locality to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce the notion of cannabis,
a federally scheduled drug, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem begins to metastasize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem metastasizes in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my view, bankers are risk averse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is a risk management business,
the default position can easily become
[SPEAKER_00]: risk avoidance rather than risk management
if there's no clear pathway to economics
[SPEAKER_00]: that would work that introduces the next
facet of the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because there is this growing
wave in our nation to discuss cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it may be de-scheduled
scares the banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because they can set up an apparatus
that will require a great deal of
[SPEAKER_00]: investment only to look up and discover
that we're now off schedule one and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the same category as a card room
or a racetrack and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therein is, I think, one of the
Rubik's cubes that need to be solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I would encourage
you all to become familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hezekiah mentioned this in the last panel,
is this document right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available on the State Treasurer's
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of it is Banking Access
Strategies for Cannabis-Related
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you just a few seconds of what
the four primary recommendations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, at least for the here and now,
develop a system that will accommodate the
[SPEAKER_00]: cash industry rather than trying to force
it into the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out a way to accommodate the cash
industry a little bit better than we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that inside the office the armored
car bus route strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 38 bus run by Brinks that makes a
scheduled stop everywhere and picks up
[SPEAKER_00]: currency to pay taxes and fees to the
state and to the local agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, develop a data portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who are familiar with the
Washington system know that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: control mechanism in that state are,
figuratively speaking, kind of bolted on
[SPEAKER_00]: the framework that was used for liquor
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, investigate the feasibility
of establishing a state-backed financial
[SPEAKER_00]: institution that would cater to or
accommodate the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I get questions on that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, and this to me is the
big one, develop a consortium of bankers,
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, cannabis industry folks,
the stakeholders that were discussed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last panel that are medical customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them together in a group that will
devote some energy and time to lobbying
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legislators and federal regulators
about the evolving nature of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the four things you'll see in
the report and we're underway with each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those four now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I can add a little perspective
from the bank side, up to about a year and
[SPEAKER_01]: a half ago I ran America's fastest growing
bank for a period of three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew from 1.9 billion to over 13
billion that period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aggregating deposits is the most difficult
thing that's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a look at it, you've got to,
if you have a perspective, A, asking for
[SPEAKER_01]: deposits or giving a loan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously asking for deposits is more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to take higher risk strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That involved EB5, broker dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cash businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regulators are spent approximately
half of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 150 business days in our offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, measuring and analyzing our
higher risk businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banks themselves can hold 25% typically if
it's well run of their collective deposit
[SPEAKER_01]: base in high risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is it's a fight for
what high risk deposits can actually sit
[SPEAKER_01]: on that balance sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that comes inherent risk that Tim
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and again, if you take a look at the
smaller banks that are participating,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are about 300 banks across the US
right now that actually actively engage in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: To actually have a KYC and AML program and
BSA program that facilitates it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: costs tens of thousands of dollars if not
hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, if you look at these
smaller banks, they don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: technology and some of the core processing
solutions to actually interpret and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand exactly where that money is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that entire process on an ongoing basis
ends up costing hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars because you need personnel and
staff to actually manage that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the main challenge that they're
having and to Tim's point, it is very
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging and the natural mentality of
the banker can be risk averse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other side of the challenge is the
actual payment side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think about Visa, MasterCard,
a bin basically is where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: transactions pass through.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think of every $100 that passes
through a bin, only $1 can actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: high risk related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by definition, cannabis is high
risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also need to come up with additional
payment mechanisms that will help evolve
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not only just a cash business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately I've been saying that we have two
policies at play.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is to allow cannabis and the other is
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's impossible to move forward unless
one is gonna win.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're back to you have to organize.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: The courts aren't gonna help.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to actually force this issue and
the absurdity of the contradictions
[SPEAKER_04]: between what is really happening and what
the population in this country wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately Congress has to do
something about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone back and forth with Fiona Ma and
other folks in the state government about
[SPEAKER_04]: a bank and while it's a really wonderful
idea and I support it, there's just too
[SPEAKER_04]: many, I think too many barriers because of
federal prohibition to allow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So until we get Congress to do something,
and this is just an old song, I feel kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of stupid bringing it up, but until we get
our Congress people to actually do
[SPEAKER_04]: something about it and organize
effectively rather than the old left-wing
[SPEAKER_04]: firing squad.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that joke, how does a left-wing
firing squad line up in a circle?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everyone's gonna have to learn how
to organize and work together,
[SPEAKER_04]: put the egos aside, and then we gotta go
to Congress because that's where
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately I think this has to get fixed.
[SPEAKER_05]: From personal experience, our companies,
we've lost two bank accounts just this
[SPEAKER_05]: month.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the reasons was we deposited more
than $5,000 per month into the account,
[SPEAKER_05]: which as a business owner, having $5,000
deposited in cash is not a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially in a cash business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other was because even though
we're a non-plant-touching business,
[SPEAKER_05]: we accept money from plant-touching
businesses and that account was
[SPEAKER_05]: subsequently shut down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now I'm gonna have to talk and
find one of those 300 banks because I have
[SPEAKER_05]: tried to open new bank accounts and we
have to put our website down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our website mentions cannabis and we have
been unable, so far we've only tried this
[SPEAKER_05]: week, but we've been unable to open a new
bank account, which is very discouraging,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially for someone who has to run a
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what change we can make.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna have to read that report too,
but hopefully these rules can change
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly because that's one more deterrent
to running a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of all of everything else,
banking is also a huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that banks have an incentive
to enter into this space because the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that they grow their revenue is through
acquisitions of other banks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they don't wanna jeopardize those
acquisitions by entering into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: space, so they're deferring and staying
away from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm from Portland, Oregon,
so in Oregon we have two more main credit
[SPEAKER_03]: unions that provide banking services,
checking and savings, $500 a month for a
[SPEAKER_03]: checking and savings account.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's to cover the cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they only have 600 accounts total and
there's over 4,400 businesses in Oregon
[SPEAKER_03]: right now that are cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of draws a picture of,
or paints a picture of just the extent of
[SPEAKER_03]: how little banking is offered to the
cannabis industry right now.
Thank you.
