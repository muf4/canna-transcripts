[SPEAKER_05]: We spent a lot of time talking today,
and so I feel like I learned a lot about
[SPEAKER_05]: Solitube.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically that it's just a very,
very reflective ductwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can get a lot of sunlight into
your building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a lot about just the whole
chemistry between behind photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed your talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from the perspective of Solitube,
is there anything that you can utilize in
[SPEAKER_05]: that, like the sort of horticultural space
is relatively new market for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're always learning about
certainly PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we better calculate for PAR?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we aid in the horticultural space
in properly designing a system?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we account for daylight?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we use the current design tools and
tweak them to support horticulture?
[SPEAKER_04]: At Solitube, they developed a really good,
it's a daylight calculator.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I heard you mention it's not
really available commercially,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you guys have a DLI calculator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a daily light integral tool that
we can use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are DLI maps or DLI daily light
integral maps available.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a bit of digging, but you can
find these for all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_05]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for different crops, less so with
cannabis at this point, but for all these
[SPEAKER_05]: different crops, there are recommended
DLIs, even down to just like different
[SPEAKER_05]: developmental stages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one strategy is just trying to hit that
target DLI.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for something like whether it's
greenhouse or whether it's a solution like
[SPEAKER_05]: Solitube, one challenge that you guys are
going to have is just by virtue of the
[SPEAKER_05]: fact that you are still reliant on
sunlight, there are going to be parts of
[SPEAKER_05]: the days and certainly times of the year
when you're really not getting enough
[SPEAKER_05]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to work cooperatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really see the synergy between our
products and the work then that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: done and how do we merge everything
together to make the most efficient system
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, but really address the needs of
horticulture and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something that you
really taught me is I really didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that the plant required different
spectra at different points in its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never really occurred to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes total sense now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we were designing with the system
is the dynamic interplay between the
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of sunlight that's available and
then your LEDs that are inside of the
[SPEAKER_04]: room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting how often people will
get caught up on, oh, well, there's not
[SPEAKER_04]: enough sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: The counter to that is really any second
you can turn off the LEDs or turn them
[SPEAKER_04]: down, you're saving money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to a certain extent, if you're up
in Alaska and maybe if it's not completely
[SPEAKER_04]: dark for 24 hours, but if you're in Maine
or your way up there, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: less light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You rely on the LEDs more, but it's less
than what you would be doing if it was 100
[SPEAKER_04]: percent artificial light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think your idea, too, I think you
had explored augmenting the daylight
[SPEAKER_01]: spectra with your tunable LEDs and really
helping address the different stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's tons more research to be
done on the specific spectral composition
[SPEAKER_04]: as it relates to secondary metabolites and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that we have indications
now that blue, blue light during veg and
[SPEAKER_04]: red light towards the flowering phase sort
of, you know, being back in California
[SPEAKER_04]: reminds me of the sunset over the
California coast in the fall where it gets
[SPEAKER_04]: very deep red.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there really just isn't empirical
research in the cannabis space that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: aware of at this point that is truly
looking at how do the different light
[SPEAKER_04]: spectral compositions affect those
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and to that end, that's actually
something that my research program at
[SPEAKER_05]: Fluence is pretty focused on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there isn't a lot of research out
there right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's more is that on both the
recreational side and on the medicinal
[SPEAKER_05]: side, there isn't a clear desired
metabolic profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: People know a lot about THC and a little
bit less so about CBD, but they know it's
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then further still, they know that
there's this class of compounds called
[SPEAKER_05]: Gambinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this class of compounds called
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that we like some kind of
cocktail of these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does CBN matter?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can look to a few different parts
of the world that are kind of driving that
[SPEAKER_05]: more clinical research and trying to
understand how these different cocktails
[SPEAKER_05]: of chemicals affect the human body for
medicinal use or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Israel is kind of the world leader in this
for what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, like we are explicitly trying to
understand how different light qualities
[SPEAKER_05]: and lighting intensity and even light
scheduling, how these affect these
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I have some published
work on for my PhD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also something that we have one
study that's publicly available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it with proof cultivar last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a grower up in Portland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was Jeremy Plum.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that study, they were looking at,
well, they, Fluence.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were looking at the red-fire-red ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we basically took one of our standard
products that has a lot of white diodes
[SPEAKER_05]: with some red diodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we took out the red diodes and added
far-red diodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were comparing these two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of these things had a red-far-red
ratio of about 17.5.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, a lot of red,
not very much far-red.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other one, the red-far-red
ratio was about 6.1.
[SPEAKER_05]: So still high-red, but a lot more far-red.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we found there was that it did
really interesting things to the terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we found there was that it didn't
just, in blanket terms, it didn't just
[SPEAKER_05]: boost monoterpenes or decrease
sesquiterpenes or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It selectively manipulated certain
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what this says to me, and also kind of
why I want to explore this further,
[SPEAKER_05]: is because what it says is that with
specific light qualities, you can
[SPEAKER_05]: manipulate and craft really specific
chemical cocktails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as soon as the market knows what it
needs, either recreationally or
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinally, we'll know how to provide
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And get the two-in-the-light recipe,
essentially, to the desired outcome of the
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do to support this process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that the goal of the IAES
conference is about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in some ways, we've sort of jumped over
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in my mind, reducing the cost of goods
sold on your cannabis flower is an
[SPEAKER_04]: absolute necessity for long-term business
survivability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a good place to start is with LEDs or a
hybrid system where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing in sunlight with those LEDs,
just to simply get your cost of goods
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon enough, we'll have interesting
commerce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at the guys that have
built a $30 million facility in Columbus,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a market which they can remain?
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're not focused on reducing those
costs and increasing their operational
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiencies at this point, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think in terms of that
particular initiative to try and
[SPEAKER_05]: understand the biochemistry a little bit
better and the mission to drive certain
[SPEAKER_05]: chemical profiles, I think Solitube is a
little bit removed from that story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mean that as a criticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have the control over the
experiment that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we could learn from working on
projects together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really learning how we could use your
tunability to augment or work with
[SPEAKER_01]: daylight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when is the right time to have
daylight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, the fun thing is,
I mean, ultimately with our product,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we need to turn it off at a certain
phase in the developmental cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to say that in the research that we
were up at Sonoma, we fueled with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Solitube.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we fueled photosynthesis with the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then we drove photosynthesis with the
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could sort of steer things in a way
that you'd like it to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really just pushing that further,
we were just doing proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first question was, can plants grow
under these things?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it was, how can we increase our
productivity?
[SPEAKER_04]: So exceeding 28 grams of square foot or 30
grams square foot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we peaked at around 33 grams per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And doing that with the absolute minimal
amount of electrical input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were experimenting with different
strains to see which strains were the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you remind me where was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonoma County, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to throw me off because I'm
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_04]: He won't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we ended up hitting, though,
in terms of grams per watt was greater
[SPEAKER_04]: than two grams per watt of input.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2.8 I think is what you achieved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't seen I haven't seen numbers
higher than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially we were looking at real
time readouts of our electrical usage and
[SPEAKER_04]: using it as like a speedometer to the
point where we could just let's get it
[SPEAKER_04]: down to 40 watts, you know, growing 100
square feet of cannabis on 40 watts.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, extremely energy
efficient.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think the question,
the next question is, what do we do to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with utilities to get programs to
support this process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's going to be key
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can the utilities do to incentivize,
you know, really functional, well
[SPEAKER_01]: designed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrid systems, hybrid systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and to that end, I mean,
kind of like I said in our panel earlier,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the best authority in the company
on this, but we have a couple of people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are focused very much on utility
rebates.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of utility providers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fluence has been very successful,
probably one of the most successful LED
[SPEAKER_04]: providers in the cannabis space at getting
those utility rebates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they essentially will award you
back the incremental costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how much more does it cost to do LEDs
versus the HPS?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to see an energy savings.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then get that incremental cost
covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, really in terms of hybrid light
systems as well, it's a matter of getting
[SPEAKER_04]: the notion that there are other ways to
approach a hybrid light facility design
[SPEAKER_04]: than just a standard greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we think about the sun grown
indoor, the solar tubes with the fluids
[SPEAKER_04]: inside of an insulated room, really what
you're getting there is an environment
[SPEAKER_04]: that's much more resilient to the outside
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's in Canada and it's snowing in
the winter, you're able to maintain your
[SPEAKER_04]: internal temperature with a lot less
energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so continuing to get the word out
there and demonstrating that the
[SPEAKER_04]: technology works in multiple areas,
in multiple climates, and then sharing
[SPEAKER_04]: that with the industry, but also utility
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really becomes collecting more data
then in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: More data, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating a synergy between SolarTube and
other companies like Fluence to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: put this data together to demonstrate how
it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some successful demonstrations are going
to be key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were mentioning you have like
several, like over 20 just in North
[SPEAKER_04]: America, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Studies have lined up for 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's impressive and it's terrifying
and exciting and a million other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, Fluence has had a tremendous
amount of success in the cannabis space in
[SPEAKER_05]: North America and worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's great for us because we can
leverage that success.
[SPEAKER_05]: To really have a pretty aggressive
research program, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a big part of the strategy is how
do we continue to innovate in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: how do we try to address some of these
bigger questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Our research, of course, is not limited to
just cannabis, but since that's what we're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have in North America probably seven or
eight really good studies ongoing right
[SPEAKER_05]: now that will round out within 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty excited about those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't be overly specific, but I'll share
what I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I guess you could say our
research questions fall into a few big
[SPEAKER_05]: bends, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, foremost, there's just maximizing
yield, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And people always want to know what is the
right spectrum for their top light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, usually when someone's
asking that, we've already overcome the
[SPEAKER_05]: debate of LED or HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you also studying temperature
effects and PPS?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the optimal ratios are?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the questions of the rest of the
environment parameters, whether it's
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature and day and night temperature
differentials and if it's irrigation and
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrition and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are research questions that we ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: For my team, they're sort of second
priority.
[SPEAKER_05]: My team is focused foremost on light,
light intensity, light quality,
[SPEAKER_05]: light sort of scheduling, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so we're looking at things like
different top light spectra.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whenever we do a study, we're looking
at things like yield, not just total shoot
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass, but also harvest index.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how much of your yield is bud,
which you actually care about?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is leaf?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is stem?
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at these carbon allocation
ratios, we're looking at dynamic lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, should you be doing
something different at the end of your
[SPEAKER_05]: crop to drive secondary metallos in a
certain way?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about just a 24 hour cycle?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like sunrise, sunset?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you done that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, we haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what was really interesting
with your foundational research was how
[SPEAKER_01]: you were able to show that the plants do
like to have a dynamic source to a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they woke up in the morning changed
depending on the light source and when it
[SPEAKER_01]: was exposed to these subtly shifting
patterns of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching them follow that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was interesting when we were
looking at the time lapses back.
[SPEAKER_04]: The LEDs would come on, let's say 7 a.m.,
but the amount of sunlight that would come
[SPEAKER_04]: into the space really wasn't, you know,
a beach ball at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Significant until like, say, 9,
30, 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as soon as that sunlight did get in
the space, the plants were just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they were essentially waiting
for that, you know, to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting to think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, you're still achieving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were, you know, at the start of the
day, you were achieving the PPFD that was
[SPEAKER_01]: desired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was truly the change in the spectral
content that all of a sudden changed how
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants reacted, which is kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Change in spectral content?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you attribute this, do you think,
to far red?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that sort of red far red just
shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where we started essentially was that,
OK, they come up, they wake up when they
[SPEAKER_04]: see the sunlight and then there's this hot
spot that moves and they started following
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just sort of an observation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't really empirically have an A-B
control.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seemed to me that the plants were
sort of appreciative of the fact that they
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't just sort of blasted with the
maximum amount of light for all 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was just sort of this sort of,
you know, dynamic, something a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: more natural.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you could test it further.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could push it further.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it just seemed to be that there was
some element where it's more of a natural
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle for them and that they seemed to
prefer the sunlight as it moved through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I know that you have some
some education in circadian rhythm
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were to try and pursue a study like
this, we the sort of collective body of
[SPEAKER_05]: plants scientists, not Fluence and not
Solitube, you know, like whoever,
[SPEAKER_05]: if we were to try and explore this in the
cannabis space, how would you recommend
[SPEAKER_05]: going about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think first of all,
I think we'd have to figure out a way of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to sample, well, studying the
the various organic compounds that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, change throughout the change
within the plant over the course of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day and actually do some controlled
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at specific action spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it change the organic compounds
present?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening within the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it becomes a, I mean, it's an
interesting question and is probably best
[SPEAKER_01]: answered with something that has a very
stable spectral content that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: control but replicate the daylight process
and then figure out then how does
[SPEAKER_01]: daylight, how do we use that dynamic
nature of daylight and the chrono spectral
[SPEAKER_01]: dosage associated with daylight to now
really drive the plant, the plant over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what we, you know,
all of us are scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate data and like collecting
data up until this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis cultivation and the industry
practices have been basically community
[SPEAKER_04]: consensus that was developed in the black
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a totally different set of market
pressures.
[SPEAKER_04]: That businesses are operating under.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so anything really that furthers,
you know, I used to joke two years ago
[SPEAKER_04]: when it was, you know, I can grow three
pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, well, do you have any data
that shows that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then get in line, you know,
so my grandma can grow three pounds of
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we're getting somewhere where
we're moving beyond that community census
[SPEAKER_04]: and challenging assumptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's it's all towards the drive of
increasing plant quality, but also
[SPEAKER_04]: operational efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really, we are getting to the
point where we have evidence based design,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Process development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I think we're right on the
cusp of being able to really change kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the old not stigmas, but the way things
have always been done or how people have
[SPEAKER_01]: certain preconceptions of how it should be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm really excited with the
research that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that really drives the
industry and certainly rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that you've done is it's it's
been fun to watch from a distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really enjoyed being able to read
your papers and research over the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks and become more understanding of
everything that you've done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Given all of our respective backgrounds,
and I think we're all ultimately trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: contribute the same same things for the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like there's an awful lot of
room for potential collaboration.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited about the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a cultivator, do you have a question
for a bunch of light scientists?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, I guess I was kind of thinking
about moving forward and how this all
[SPEAKER_02]: really comes together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's obviously more data,
more experimentation, collecting that data
[SPEAKER_02]: and going back to yield above and beyond
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, it's really about yield of
the secondary metabolites and terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: content and sort of trying to determine
how we are activating these genetics on
[SPEAKER_02]: different levels with this system and the
synergy of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whether it's cannabis or any other
crop, something that we look at is really
[SPEAKER_05]: the interaction between the genetics and
the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you apply this to sort of human
development, the sort of nature versus
[SPEAKER_05]: nurture type thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I would say that understanding
the environment is crucial because
[SPEAKER_05]: inevitably, for better or worse,
there are going to be companies that are
[SPEAKER_05]: doing things with breeding programs and
maybe genetic modification is going to get
[SPEAKER_05]: involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of these different things kind of
on the sort of more biological side,
[SPEAKER_05]: more genetic side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we start playing around with that
before we understand how the environment
[SPEAKER_05]: impacts any of that, it's just going to
become a very convoluted mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Changing too many variables at once.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think keeping control and testing one
thing at a time is going to be key to
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_04]: Data is no longer evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Collect it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of like going down the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's each of your understanding of how
kind of plants, what kind of light a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plant needs at different stages
of its life cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm certainly the novice here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually look to these two gentlemen
because I just know they like light and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've certainly learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the spectral content over the life
cycle is definitely new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I wasn't aware of
actually before today, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Jonathan, you and David
certainly are the two who best answer this
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that the best light for
plants is the plant that they evolved to
[SPEAKER_04]: utilize for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be that of the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are spectral banks within PAR
that we know drive certain segments of
[SPEAKER_04]: growth based on the absorption profiles,
correct me if I'm wrong, of chlorophylls
[SPEAKER_04]: and carotenoids.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's pretty clear that we can
use blues and reds in early flowering or
[SPEAKER_04]: veg and then late flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: One that often comes up as well is UV and
the application use of UV and what that
[SPEAKER_04]: means for secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I personally haven't seen empirical
research that shows one way or the other
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly what the UV does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think, you know, we're all sort
of looking out into the horizon that there
[SPEAKER_04]: is more to untangle with the spectral
composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we truly know has yet to be
known, which is, as a scientist,
[SPEAKER_04]: something that you find exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the UV trigger the plant's protective
mechanisms and development?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's one theory.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll pass to David.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you get a little bit more specific
on that?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I'll start by answering the UV
question specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: The short answer is... Stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, that is sort of a good way
to think of UV as a plant stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to some degree, you can think of it as
just sort of a more extreme blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, just like Jonathan said, the
empirical evidence in cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely lacking.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a whole, sort of the photobiology of
cannabis is a pretty sparsely populated
[SPEAKER_05]: world right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But UV in particular, there's really only
a handful of papers that have directly
[SPEAKER_05]: explored UV and cannabis chemical profile,
basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one that people tend to reference is
by a guy named John Lydon and his research
[SPEAKER_05]: group from 1987.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were doing low doses of UVB.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they had a peak emission of 310
nanometers or 285 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically what they found was that
with these low doses, the THC
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrations went up proportionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a pretty well done study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But nobody has done anything on it since.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, this is a question that
we're cautiously looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough to do really good UVB research
because it's also a little bit dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, UVB, for one, you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it's on, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And secondly, I mean, the shorter the
wavelength that you have, the less time it
[SPEAKER_05]: takes for it to do damage to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's really just about the total
amount of energy that's being applied to
[SPEAKER_05]: your eyes and your skin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's literally just, it has enough
energy to break molecular bonds,
[SPEAKER_05]: including DNA bonds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And your DNA is always repairing itself,
but sometimes it makes mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you say, you know what,
DNA, I'm just going to keep hammering you
[SPEAKER_05]: with this UV, eventually your DNA is going
to go, all right, well, I've had enough
[SPEAKER_05]: cancer time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, all that to say, if we take a
look
[SPEAKER_05]: at UVB, it's similar to like when we go
outside and we have exposure to UV light
[SPEAKER_05]: and we get a suntan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's our skin protecting ourselves
from these UV light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants do the same thing to some extent,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's if you look at grapes,
or if you look at red leaf lettuce,
[SPEAKER_05]: or if you look at blueberries,
all of that pigmentation, that anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_05]: is for protecting against high energy
photons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now with cannabis, the question that we're
asking in one of our studies right now is,
[SPEAKER_05]: do you need to do this with UVB?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you do it with UVA?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or can you just do it with blue,
which is A, for us, way cheaper to
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacture.
[SPEAKER_05]: The diodes have a way longer lifespan,
and it's way safer for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the jury's out.
[SPEAKER_05]: The photoreceptor is also a little bit
different between blue and UVB,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's a whole separate thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you read it on a weed growers
forum doesn't necessarily mean that
[SPEAKER_04]: empirical science was done to truly
understand that, you know, it's not an
[SPEAKER_04]: authoritative source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think what was pretty interesting
today, which I'd never drawn the
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation before, but was very
interesting during our session this
[SPEAKER_01]: morning, was when we were talking about
the fact that obviously we have photopic
[SPEAKER_01]: vision, we have the photopic spectral
response curve for daytime vision of the
[SPEAKER_01]: human eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what was very interesting is that
when I realized that the circadian
[SPEAKER_01]: response curve through the human eye in
the IPRGCs, the retinal ganglion cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually directly follows the same action
spectra as the blue end required for
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis in the Cree curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that was pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if there are any similarities
we can start to draw because my experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and expertise is in vertebrate
chronobiological and photobiological
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of interesting because we
know that the human eye and the
[SPEAKER_01]: vertebrates have obviously some danger
zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we get outside of the visible
spectrum into the UV side of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be interesting to know whether maybe
plants have the same problematic response.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of a danger wavelength, what you're
promising.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, isn't it just tough to supplement
UV back into an indoor space,
[SPEAKER_04]: predictively?
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say that's tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, before LED, there are a number of
other technologies like fluorescent tubes,
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's a few other things
historically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a tanning bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great example.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other sources of UV.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I know, none of them have great
lifespans, and they're not particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: bright, not that you want a whole boatload
of UV.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think it's particularly
challenging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've even seen some really interesting
deployments of UV.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like outside of cannabis, UVB and UVC
can actually be deployed to deal with
[SPEAKER_05]: superficial pests like powdery mildew and
botrytis, things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen solutions where if people have,
for instance, a long kind of four-foot
[SPEAKER_05]: wide table, and they have an irrigation
boom that moves the length of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: they have mounted the UV bar just to this,
and it just kind of passes over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a sterilizer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, there are other things too,
like certain sort of strategic
[SPEAKER_05]: applications of UVB or C.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can induce systemic acquired response
in some plants, in other words,
[SPEAKER_05]: boost their immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're doing more than just that
surface sterilization.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're also saying to the plant,
you know, be hardier and defend yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's doable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my note from your presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the photoreactivity and boosting the
immune system and perhaps pest resistance
[SPEAKER_04]: with the UV.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not done with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So forget cannabis specifically,
just like for each of you as people who
[SPEAKER_03]: study plants and light, what's kind of
like some seminal research that like,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you look at the body of light plant
science research, kind of like what was
[SPEAKER_03]: groundbreaking in each of your opinions,
like in the understanding of how plants
[SPEAKER_03]: react to light?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess, yeah, I too, and I'm
going to say this first one where I'm not
[SPEAKER_05]: at all trying to just sort of toot my own
horn.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a question that I've been kind of
asking for a little while is about plant
[SPEAKER_05]: acclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, you know, if you grow plants in
one light environment for a little while,
[SPEAKER_05]: what does that mean for what we understand
about light that you use later on?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a bunch of applications for
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know you said not specific to
cannabis, but cannabis is a good example.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if the light that you use during
veg has any influence on how the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: respond to the light used during flower,
that's a pretty big question that affects
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But on sort of more like commercial
agriculture side, you can look at it from
[SPEAKER_05]: the perspective of maybe strawberries and
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberries are propagated basically
clonally.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can think of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's on like these runners kind of in
a field and they're in a certain light
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it's sunlight, but maybe you've
propagated them a different way in a
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, does that light environment
where you got all of your strawberry stock
[SPEAKER_05]: for your production change how those
plants will respond to the light that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're giving them when they're when
they're fruiting later on?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really interested in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess the other big thing to me
is is this question of far red.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's I have a love hate relationship with
the sort of far red discussion just
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's been going on for quite a
while and it's changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's challenging because there's a lot of
really conflicting evidence about what far
[SPEAKER_05]: red does specifically for photosynthesis
and does it drive photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not going to take a stance here
because again, there's just this
[SPEAKER_05]: conflicting evidence that I'm still
weeding through trying to understand it a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I think about far red and if
customer calls and they insist that they
[SPEAKER_05]: want to speak to the research group of far
red, that comes to me and I usually just
[SPEAKER_05]: say, well, look, it has pretty well
understood sort of morphological impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can count on it most of the time
to kind of stretch out your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a really compelling reason
to do that, and there are some,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you have a compelling reason to do
that, then yeah, it's a good choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're just trying to add it to get
more yields, there are probably better
[SPEAKER_05]: tools we can recommend for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's something I want to
understand a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that both of you have said that
kind of has piqued my interest was the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that, you know, based on the
different types of plants that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: where they come from, defines what it is
that they want or what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of curious as we start to look
at increasing the yield of certain plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: if studying kind of where they're that
what their home environment is,
[SPEAKER_01]: how, you know, if there's a specific
growth season, how does special content
[SPEAKER_01]: change, say from spring to summer to fall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that needs to be
replicated that we can replicate then?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the lab in the indoor environment
to further reinforce kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biological need or.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you were mentioning, too,
is like CRISPR and bringing in DNA
[SPEAKER_04]: technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen any studies where people are
trying to add another chlorophyll or like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, mutant chlorophyll?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have heard of people talking about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more conversation about this and
kind of like microbial space and plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a bunch of wild stuff
going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something called chlorophyll F,
which I did a YouTube video on a little
[SPEAKER_05]: while ago, which is great because that'll
be a version of me explaining and
[SPEAKER_05]: remembering how that works.
[SPEAKER_05]: This version of me doesn't remember,
but it's nice to say chlorophyll F.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sensitive to different peak
wavelengths than chlorophyll A and B.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's typical in plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, in theory, if you were to
take something like chlorophyll F that has
[SPEAKER_05]: a different absorption spectrum,
a different spectra and a few other
[SPEAKER_05]: chlorophylls and somehow mesh them all
into one where you just super effectively
[SPEAKER_05]: absorb all the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also the reality of that is just like
there's this whole light harvesting
[SPEAKER_05]: complex where all of these pigments and
proteins interact in a pretty specific
[SPEAKER_05]: mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Downstream signaling pathways get chaotic
and complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't just add a gene and have
that protein nicely integrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I don't know very many seminal
papers in plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I I think that the big
realization for me was once I understood
[SPEAKER_04]: what the McCree curve was and then I saw
what an HPS light output, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: just how did this even happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did we even get here?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you were to make data driven
decisions, this wouldn't even have been an
[SPEAKER_04]: option that you would pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that, you know, really,
it was more about me wading into plant
[SPEAKER_04]: photobiology from a neuroscience
background, you know, not from not from a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant sciences background at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not, you know, immensely familiar
with those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just quickly, we had talked about the
legendary Bruce Bugbee before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had talked about Bruce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Bugbee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his most recent research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just give the the since you only
read the synopsis, can you give the the
[SPEAKER_03]: synopsis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very poor synopsis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't be fair for me to comment
beyond that because I haven't read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, I read the abstract in the
punch line.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I understood it was that he was saying
that far red light should be included in
[SPEAKER_05]: the definition of par or for synthetically
active radiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because presumably in this paper,
and it feels awful to be commenting on
[SPEAKER_05]: this because, again, I haven't read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But presumably in there, he has evidence
that says or clearly demonstrates that far
[SPEAKER_05]: red drives photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really looking forward to reading
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Find a time on a flight somewhere.
Yeah.
All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
