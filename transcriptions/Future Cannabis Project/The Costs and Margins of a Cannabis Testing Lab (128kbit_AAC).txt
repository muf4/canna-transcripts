[SPEAKER_00]: You're the gatekeepers for the regulations
that comes with cost.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, so like lab margins, just talk about
a little, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, laboratories, so everybody thinks that
if you own a lab you make a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you think about how a lab
has to run, right, and think about what
[SPEAKER_01]: our primary product out, people think is a
COA, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's customer satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we like every other business have to,
our product is happy customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in order to make a happy customer,
you have to be able to meet a reasonable
[SPEAKER_01]: turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to meet a reasonable turnaround
time, that means you have to build your
[SPEAKER_01]: lab in a way that you have capacity,
you know, unused capacity, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment you build max out your capacity and
something breaks, your customers are now
[SPEAKER_01]: unhappy because they're not getting
turnaround time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is a vicious cycle that we go
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you think about it from those terms
and what the margin on your unused
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity has to be to be able to meet
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, now you're looking at to start up a
lab, you need at least two of everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: and two of everything gets you about 50
samples a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's not a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, you know, with 50 samples a day
and two of everything, you can keep that
[SPEAKER_01]: many customers happy, however many
customers give you 50 samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's one large company or a bunch
of small companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you would like to get larger than
that, oh, and here's the important part,
[SPEAKER_01]: two of everything will set you back
somewhere between depending on whether you
[SPEAKER_01]: go at high end or low end equipment,
a million and a half to two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the entry fee to play the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't include building,
that doesn't include all the other lab
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment that needs to be able to help
run a lab like the pipetters, doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: include your salaries, or anything like
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab salaries are pretty substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, you don't want unskilled
labor running your machines that cost
[SPEAKER_01]: $800,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a bad idea.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so that's just to get
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, now, if you would like to scale,
and try to be a larger player in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, now you're looking at having to
have, well, let's use Steep Hill,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, our Berkeley lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I have one, two, three, four,
five, five LCs, another liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another four or five liquid
chromatographs with mass spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, to be able to do pesticides,
I have seven GCMSs to be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: residual solvents, some pesticides,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, ICP-MS, you need a few of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you need at least two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I said you need two, at least two
of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so now, you know,
that's, you're looking at just,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that's, that's just the chemistry
that has nothing to do with microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and all the incubators and all the
stuff for that, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then, oh, wait, we forgot
water activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forgot microscopes and cameras for
visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to have a quality
assurance manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have training programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have, so now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have to have people who have,
who have been trained and are certified in
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can't be just any sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a statistical sampling
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be, you know, so, so,
you know, then you have to have a vehicle,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because by law, or six, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or by, because by law, right, you can't
lease a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or rent a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to own the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the BCC regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so now, oh, wait, storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forgot storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to get storage cut down to a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 45 freaking business days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I had to devote part of my lab to a
locked storage facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these, and because none of these things
were actually considered before the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations went into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as all of these things kept
piling up, they kept dumping it like at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same spot, the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and I'm not saying that it was
done maliciously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it kind of was the, the, oh,
well, that's, yeah, that's a good spot
[SPEAKER_01]: they have for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let them keep it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point they, they wanted the batches
to actually be held in a facility at the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, whoa, dude, we don't even
want to keep the excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should sample twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the one sample with us and leave the
other sample locked in quarantine at the
[SPEAKER_01]: producers because they have, it's,
you know, I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we saw what happened in
Washington state with the lab where they
[SPEAKER_00]: were caught smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lost their license or it was like
under jeopardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those things could ease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a testing lab in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than throw the stuff away,
they were caught, you know, smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it was a lab chain that was
in California, loosey goosey playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all labs are, you know,
well, so if the state of California thinks
[SPEAKER_01]: that wasn't happening in California,
they were sadly diluted because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our track and trace system,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our track and trace system is still only
marginally functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I believe it is functioning,
but I believe that the majority of people
[SPEAKER_01]: are still not on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without track and trace, you can't
track and trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, so that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, can they audit after the
fact?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we, you know, so, but now here,
here's the other problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was this whole other level of
stuff that nobody considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how did we get rid of all this
cannabis waste from the laboratory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call it local.
[SPEAKER_01]: The local trash pickup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh hell no, we don't take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being treated as hazardous waste and
some of the most expensive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we have to pay for, for tonnage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not cannabis before they'll take
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be mixed with water or kitty
litter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to, and we had to pay the
combined weight, not just the weight of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis, the weight of the water and
the kitty litter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real unintended consequence right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you seeing unintended consequences?
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
