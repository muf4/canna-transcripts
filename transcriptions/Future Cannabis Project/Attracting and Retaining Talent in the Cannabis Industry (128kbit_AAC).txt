[SPEAKER_02]: Attracting is not the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's lots of people right
now who want to get into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry on the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a big buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of people who want to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sifting through all of those resumes is
something that's a little bit trickier and
[SPEAKER_02]: he touched a little bit on that that we
have this really lengthy hiring process to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that the person that we're
bringing onto the team is really a good
[SPEAKER_02]: fit because we do struggle with a lot of
turnover and it's very difficult to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: someone on, have them fill out all that HR
paperwork, train them in all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different things just to have them walk
away a couple weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like more of a struggle is sifting
through and finding the right addition to
[SPEAKER_02]: the team.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm looking for when I'm sifting
through resumes is more people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing experiences from other industries
than necessarily people who are bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people who have cannabis experience
have experience in an illegal industry
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're expecting things like cash
at the end of the day or not having to
[SPEAKER_02]: show up to work on time or being able to
be overtly medicated while at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a huge misconception is that oh
you guys are just all back there smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: all day like no this job is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna be working a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finding people who are interested in
cannabis the way we do it and not cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that it was done five ten years
ago is is a little bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking for people with either
retail experience, inventory experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: medical experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have experience in local government
like yes I will definitely hire you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are all things what we found is
that you can take these skills and adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: them to cannabis instead of trying to
bring somebody in and teach them customer
[SPEAKER_02]: service.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know if I can take someone who came
from a retail background they understand
[SPEAKER_02]: how to talk with people, how to to study a
product line and do all these other
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a lot easier for me to train
than necessarily someone who's just a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can meet lots of cannabis
enthusiasts that are very intelligent but
[SPEAKER_02]: there's also the flip side of it that
that's all they're interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important to make sure
that you're finding people with diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: interests that can that can do a lot of
things for the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me the the thing that I a lot of
times hire for it's something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot train.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot mentor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's is integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that's the same way that I do
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have a company that I don't align
with their business philosophy I no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: carry their product because I cannot I
feel like as an activist and a leader in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry is I want to support the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that when I'm hiring people
or buying product I want the best and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that puts us into the situation of okay
now you have them how do you keep them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an industry which has never
give paid vacations or even proper pay
[SPEAKER_00]: legal pay and you know Cassie and I
regularly have meetings on do we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: where can we give raises you know who
needs a raise who's due for this who needs
[SPEAKER_00]: a vacation and we want to make sure that
that's taken care of because if I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: offer it there's a another company that's
coming for that does offer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's I mean that's which is a
really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives us to step up our game on how
we're going to take care of staff before
[SPEAKER_00]: we hired solely from the fact that there
were people that didn't want to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: any other industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only wanted to work in cannabis and
only ever had work in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their standards were not at the same
level as a lot of other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as we're pulling people from other
industries over here as I was the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: hired Cassie and when I worked with
another store specifically in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were under the only the medical
umbrella is I would love to find people
[SPEAKER_00]: that had worked in healing and other areas
specifically natural healing even pharmacy
[SPEAKER_00]: technicians I mean they're understanding a
lot of the medications that some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: patients were on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a healing background was
actually something that really attracted
[SPEAKER_00]: me to actually bringing Cassie on was
because she had such a diverse background
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in natural healing and that's
what I feel like cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes if somebody is like my
sales manager was a sales manager for
[SPEAKER_00]: Nordstrom like this brings their best
practices over to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know it was somebody that they
were ready to get into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our goal is to keep them on which
should be really difficult specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're losing your management team
and we're having such a deficit in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry of finding and keeping good but
tenders because they move up quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as they're good at their job and they
reap the benefits of the training that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're receiving on their job and a year
they're a perfect candidate for a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good sales rep position for a company
which is going to offer more flexibility
[SPEAKER_00]: in their schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you know Cassie and I
have to understand that we need to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these needs that we can keep
qualified candidates on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good but tenders are definitely being
poached by brands but they're also being
[SPEAKER_02]: poached by management positions you know
because good management is also in deficit
[SPEAKER_02]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know if you've got good skills and
a good work ethic a lot of times you're
[SPEAKER_02]: moving up the ranks very quickly which
then we lose our best people on the front
[SPEAKER_02]: lines you know because your but tenders
are the face of your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the people who are out there
talking to patrons every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some people that that is their
that is the goal that we have both decided
[SPEAKER_00]: upon when we hired them that we knew that
they would be moving into a different
[SPEAKER_00]: track that they would be coming on and
soon would become a team leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a team leader is before you get
to assistant manager and then assistant
[SPEAKER_00]: manager before you get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's sometimes we hire people that
just plug right into one of those roles
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't go from that section but we
want to have upward mobility for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our positions and all of our staff member
to understand that one of the worst things
[SPEAKER_00]: for any business is where people feel
stuck in that job and they can't move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do oftentimes hire and promote
from within.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's times that we need to bring in
something to add to our best practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this goes back to the
retention question is how to retain
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes good pay and good benefits to stay
competitive with other industries is
[SPEAKER_02]: essential.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just having people feel good within
their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like seeing internal promotion like
if I work hard I can get to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: These goals are fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had mentioned this a little bit
before of just organizational structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: People understanding how the business
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your role in your job description.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is who you report to and this is who
they report to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that really gives people a
lot of confidence in in the business that
[SPEAKER_02]: they OK they know what they're doing
instead of sometimes like oh well
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it's me which kind of happens a
lot I think in cannabis and then people
[SPEAKER_02]: get cranky like oh well we're making the
same wage but I'm working so much harder
[SPEAKER_02]: where when you when you say OK you are
working harder you're a team leader.
[SPEAKER_02]: People feel a little bit more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel as though they're being
recognized for what they're doing and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that that helps retain employees
when you can say I see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to reward you for that and keep you
happy in this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I am merit based not
seniority based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've worked here for a year and
you're not showing me that you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not showing me that you deserve
more and many issues then that's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However if I have somebody who comes on
and they're just killing it every step of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way if I don't support that and let
them know that you're doing a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: job here they're going to start pulling
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big on positive reinforcement for my
staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cast and I both are very much so we praise
our teams and praise our staff members
[SPEAKER_00]: when we hit goals when when we have
somebody that just goes above and beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: like we utilize something that I brought
from another business over to our industry
[SPEAKER_00]: into cannabis here at the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert in cannabis but I think
that's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: through Slack or you can you know it's
helped us tremendously and using software
[SPEAKER_00]: systems has allowed for us to increase our
efficiency in our store and create better
[SPEAKER_00]: dialogue and communication between each
other which I think helps with staff
[SPEAKER_00]: morale because staff morale can just be
very detrimental to your staff if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not taking care of them if you don't have
you know good discount program in place
[SPEAKER_00]: where that they can afford to buy their
own medicine then it creates issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're gonna have issues of theft and
you're gonna have issues of shrinkage and
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're moving into metric where I can
have a 2.5% variance on my inventory
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna be a big issue for us and
making sure that our staff is is you know
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their best to not have sticky
fingers and often times when employees of
[SPEAKER_00]: any business when I came from retail world
and in veterinary if you take care of your
[SPEAKER_00]: staff and you respect them then their
integrity level actually goes up there
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't feel like well I'm
being shorted over here so I'm gonna short
[SPEAKER_00]: them over here and that's something that
we're all gonna have to understand moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward especially when we're gonna be in
such strict compliance is how is our how
[SPEAKER_00]: our employees handling inventory are they
actually reporting it properly and which
[SPEAKER_00]: will be quite interesting to get in this
next six months because this is where a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the I think the fruits of our labor
will actually come through is because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Cassie and I I feel like we've always
been ahead of the pack and leading in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and every time we've hit
milestones we're like July 1st like we've
[SPEAKER_00]: not stressed as bad as I've seen my
brothers and sisters in this industry I
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely agree with what you're saying
about communication being really important
[SPEAKER_02]: for retention morale I have been in a
situation where you have a bud tender
[SPEAKER_02]: who's told completely conflicting
information by two managers right so when
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got somebody here they're trying to
do a good job but they're hearing this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing from one person this thing for
another person and they got a patient
[SPEAKER_02]: yelling at them right now like that is a
very stressful place to be in so by us
[SPEAKER_02]: communicating better and again back to
this organizational structure you have
[SPEAKER_02]: people who just feel more confident in
what they're doing they know yes I can go
[SPEAKER_02]: back and get this inventory because I
understand the protocols where when that
[SPEAKER_02]: communication isn't there there's a lot of
times where mistakes happen and people are
[SPEAKER_02]: yelled at for those mistakes even though
they were never really told what they were
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to do in the first place and I
think one of the biggest misconceptions I
[SPEAKER_02]: think about cannabis staffing is that
being a bud tender which we call them
[SPEAKER_02]: customer assistance I'm just gonna switch
to that is an unskilled position because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really not we're asking people to
understand an entire product line to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand complex regulations and body
systems and body systems and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: addition of that final one these things
are changing on a day-to-day basis and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're dealing with angry clientele who
doesn't understand why those changes are
[SPEAKER_02]: yes we're obsessed with the regulations
and reading through them every day but for
[SPEAKER_02]: the most part is patrons are coming in
they're like what do you mean I need a bag
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you mean I don't need a bag
anymore this is really difficult I think
[SPEAKER_02]: for for bud tenders to deal with and so
they have to be trained to deal with how
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna study that how are they
gonna come in to work on a Monday and and
[SPEAKER_02]: explain all this stuff and then Tuesday
they have to explain a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: things that's not for the week I don't
think so I have I well and we used to have
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly staff meetings and we did our best
to make those happen however now when a
[SPEAKER_00]: business is open you know we're here from
7 in the morning until 10 11 sometimes at
[SPEAKER_00]: night having staff meetings can't exist
and so something that your team
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented which I think was brilliant is
they have shift meetings so it's a coming
[SPEAKER_00]: on a G shift and it's something that y'all
all write a document together that's
[SPEAKER_00]: shared between everybody all the
management team to where the same message
[SPEAKER_00]: is being delivered at every single like
shift change so that everybody's up to
[SPEAKER_00]: date with this changing policy and which I
think is brilliant and that's what we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be doing because in the past when we've
taken it away from one cook in the kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've started to give responsibilities
out and that's when employees start to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like well who do I go to on this I'm
getting one person telling me this and one
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where we have to create to
continue to define those roles where the
[SPEAKER_00]: staff doesn't feel like there's too many
cooks in the kitchen like oh I go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sales manager for this or the inventory
manager or the processing manager and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we need to make those roles more
defined and that's what we continue to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is just when we were met with these issues
we write better SOPs I think our training
[SPEAKER_02]: programs are pretty innovative I think
that I've heard a lot of times from
[SPEAKER_02]: employees like oh well I was the cashier
they trained me for like two hours or like
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everything there is to know about
cannabis like I don't even know everything
[SPEAKER_02]: there is to know about cannabis you know
so I think that that is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: something that sets us apart is that we
make sure that the people that are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: in that are using our POS system that are
taking out and restocking our inventory we
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that they absolutely know what
they're doing it might seem like overkill
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like hey you're gonna bud tent for me
but that's really the best way to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: and to make sure that that transaction is
rung up correctly to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the inventory protocols
inventory how easy is counting right I
[SPEAKER_02]: have a four-year-old she's great at it but
how complicated are inventory protocols
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure that not only floor stock back
stock holds defective products things like
[SPEAKER_02]: all these different things have to be
found in inventory so it's not simply as
[SPEAKER_02]: easy as going out on the floor picking up
a bucket and counting it you also to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure none of those packages are damaged
that they're all in fact the same name so
[SPEAKER_02]: these are all things that people think oh
inventory so simple but it actually
[SPEAKER_02]: requires a little bit more of a walk
through the process so I think that's one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that I feel like we almost get made
fun of by our employees for extensive
[SPEAKER_02]: training program but I also feel a lot
more confident that the information that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're giving to patrons is standardized
because I know that they've all been
[SPEAKER_02]: through this with me and they know what is
good and not good to do and say and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of myths in our industry
that are sold as facts and so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm really excited on is this next
phase of lab testing when we're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: into terpene testing that I have a good
friend who manages stores in New Jersey
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're the only time they're allowed
to say sativa and indica is when they say
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not true and that's where I'm
really looking forward to us when we have
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody come in the door and like I need
something that's good for sleep you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like we can go to a strain that's
high and linalool and nursing versus let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just say like OG Kush which is oftentimes
one of the top terpenes and OG Kush is
[SPEAKER_00]: pining which is a stimulant that's why OGs
hit you hard and so I'm really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to this and that's where to hit on
Cassie's base is that training you know if
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient comes in there diabetic and
they're on insulin and they want to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis like we need to let them know
that your blood sugar could shift and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could become more responsive to your
insulin which is a benefit however if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're injecting yourself with insulin
every day and you don't realize and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same dose every day and you're not
checking your blood sugar often you may
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with issues of low blood sugar if
you're on warfarin and which is a blood
[SPEAKER_00]: thinner it could increase the
effectiveness of your warfarin these are
[SPEAKER_00]: things that patients and and customers
need to know and as an industry we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: a very terrible job of explaining this
solely for the fact that the research is
[SPEAKER_00]: not readily available to everyone but it's
it's getting there and I also think that
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is very unique about how we
do things very differently is solely just
[SPEAKER_00]: our hiring methods and how we work and how
we sift through resumes and how we you
[SPEAKER_00]: know bring on people to our team as an
introduction to where the entire team
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't just like phase like oh there's this
new personality here and it shifts
[SPEAKER_00]: everything over and it can create bad
stuff around like everybody feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: they get brought on as a team member so
they know that the whole team pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: are one of them which makes them feel
great about coming to their job and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the team knows that they that this
is going to be a good candidate I think
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes just starting people out if it
starts on a bad note those are employees
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't tend to last long like they
come into work dreading coming into work
[SPEAKER_00]: their productivity shows so I think in
general like our hiring practices and our
[SPEAKER_00]: just our accounting practices are very
different so we basically begin with we go
[SPEAKER_02]: through resumes and we pick x amount of
candidates that we invite for a group
[SPEAKER_02]: interview so we usually hold it's a little
different because the volume of the store
[SPEAKER_02]: but we usually hold four group interviews
which we try and fill with as many people
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible and then from that you know
that's held with me and then one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: other managers who does a lot of
scheduling it's ten candidates with me and
[SPEAKER_02]: another one of my my assistant director
and she's in charge of mostly scheduling
[SPEAKER_02]: and things like that so you sit down with
the two of us and we filter through we ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you a bunch of fun questions like Brett
said we go off your resume so everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: introduces themselves and why they want to
be in cannabis but after that I'll pick
[SPEAKER_02]: from your resume hey you've worked 12
years in retail tell me about an upset
[SPEAKER_02]: customer or you know you've been a
paralegal that's we don't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: those but sometimes clerks and things like
that you know talk about different
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting structures that you had to do
and how you kept those organized you know
[SPEAKER_02]: so we ask people specific questions to
their resume and it's great we learn a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of things we also try and touch base on
their cannabis knowledge do you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between THC and CBD Indica and
sativa etc so from there we choose our
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite candidates which return then for
a working interview now the working
[SPEAKER_02]: interview is not done with me and the my
other manager who has done the group
[SPEAKER_02]: interview this is done with other members
of management and then with the team so
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually come in and they spend two
hours in a department so sometimes they're
[SPEAKER_02]: more in reception sometimes they're more
in sales but they're actually working
[SPEAKER_02]: alongside team members I think the biggest
benefit to this is that who you say you
[SPEAKER_02]: are in a job interview in front of people
who you know are hiring managers and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that is sometimes very
different than how you act amongst your
[SPEAKER_02]: peers so this has been I can't tell you
how many times I've loved a candidate and
[SPEAKER_02]: then somebody else is like no they were
you know rude or unprofessional or all
[SPEAKER_02]: these other things that comes from my team
members not just other members of
[SPEAKER_02]: management but their peers the people
they're gonna be working alongside and
[SPEAKER_00]: they give examples of what the situation I
don't just say like it from a just a
[SPEAKER_00]: condescending way like I just didn't like
them like there's actual proof behind that
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's actually a best practice that I
took from veterinary industry because in
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas you're not required to have a
license to work as a veterinary technician
[SPEAKER_00]: or to run anesthesia or to place IVs or
anything like this and there's multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons for that it's also one reason why
you know we have Texas A&M is the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: vet schools in Texas so it's a way for
them to actually work with more people and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are hiring people for a lot of
reasons like they're hiring people to work
with us because they are kind of like a
health care professional and they're
hiring people who are really well equipped
and they're able to do this work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right way and I'm not saying that the
veterinary costs are significantly lower
[SPEAKER_00]: there however hiring people is much more
difficult it's kind of like the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: as when I was buying product before that
didn't have lab testing and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things like I had to require all those
things well when hiring vet technicians
[SPEAKER_00]: they needed to come in and show me that
they knew how to place IVs that they knew
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do these things even though they
may even have a license that says that
[SPEAKER_00]: they they are registered vet tech some of
the And it was a lot of it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that tech staff are very close
knit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this was not going to be a
personality type that worked well with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they didn't have the skills to allow
them to work well with it, it was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I got into cannabis, that was such
a foreign thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you just hired pretty girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and they're like, no, now you
actually force them into, uh, stepping
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of their comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big thing I look forward to is
critical thinking skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, okay, so you came from banking,
you were, you know, a bank teller,
[SPEAKER_00]: you did this, like I need to know that you
can translate some of your business
[SPEAKER_00]: practices over to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's in general,
I won't get on that soapbox, but critical
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking skills in general suck most of
the time for a lot of people, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: younger groups and others, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that is another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we do get a lot of really young
applicants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to pull from other places to get
a truly more diverse workforce,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I know patrons love to see,
like we have a lot of older patrons yet
[SPEAKER_02]: they're always talking to young staff
members.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really hard to have, you know,
someone half your age tell you what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not that there's, there shouldn't be
understanding for their training and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that there, but I think it is
really important to make sure that your
[SPEAKER_02]: staff does look like the diverse
population, that you get a good sample so
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, there's somebody that
pretty much everybody can relate to on
[SPEAKER_02]: your sales floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows for a lot of empathy across
the team of understanding where what may
[SPEAKER_00]: work for Brett, who's epileptic and they
don't have it, they're going to go off of
[SPEAKER_00]: what works well for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we also promote cross
like, but tending cross patient
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting, where bringing another but
tender or patient consultant or customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: a consultant consultant to help on a with
a patient or a customer so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: give that that person the most well
rounded experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back to the interview process after
that, not working interview that we go
[SPEAKER_02]: through where we test for all these
different skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree that it is it's good for
current employee morale, because they feel
[SPEAKER_02]: as though they have a little bit of say
and they're not just gonna somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna come in that they're not gonna like,
you know, they they feel as though they're
[SPEAKER_02]: part of building this team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after they do that, we have a 30 day
probation period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna come in and you're gonna
work for us for 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an internship, you're basically
going to get paid nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just gonna make sure you can cut
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's above minimum wage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we bring them in at this lower rate to
make sure that again, that you weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding us lip service during your
interview that you're really someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a good fit for this team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody listening to this who's
actually been in a dispensary knows that
[SPEAKER_02]: the the front lines, you know,
what you're seeing on the sales floor is
[SPEAKER_02]: very different from the vibe and back of
house, you know, so being able to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: all of those sections, and as much as it's
an interview for us to make sure that this
[SPEAKER_02]: is a good candidate, I think it's also an
essential time for that candidate to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that cannabis is for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they might have thought,
oh, it's going to be cool to work in a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the ins and outs of being there
and having to take seriously something
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe has been only fun in your life
is too much of a transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that 30 day period is also
super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's during that time that you get
your sexual harassment training and your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis trading and you fill out all the
paperwork and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can extend the probationary period
based on if there were any issues that had
[SPEAKER_00]: come up that they weren't hitting the
milestones that we were needing them to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's where at the end of
probationary period, we may decide that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not a fit for the team,
or we may feel that we need to extend the
[SPEAKER_00]: probationary period so that they can have
a better understanding of what we need
[SPEAKER_00]: from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's prevented largely
with good communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're every time they're coming into
work, we're doing a better job of like
[SPEAKER_00]: guiding them through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an industry that has just
regularly hired people and just plug and
[SPEAKER_00]: play and just let them learn on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just doesn't work well in general
with any job.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think is something that's unique
about us is just our accounting and our
[SPEAKER_00]: payroll services.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are getting a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are getting pay stubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like you paid your taxes,
paid your taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not getting hit with that at the
end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're paying our taxes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know that we're paying
employee taxes and workman's comp,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that's something for
us that is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that's been in my
business practices since I've gotten into
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that payroll should be
realistically taking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 30 percent of our budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if we're sitting there
where we've grown so much recently at
[SPEAKER_00]: times that we're making up 10 percent or
11 percent of our budget is payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a key thing for Cassie and I when
we need to go and say, hey, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: hire people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sitting here only making 11 percent
of our budget is going towards payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we need to do raises and we
need to do hiring so that we can fill that
[SPEAKER_00]: void.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know as much as like,
oh, I'm saving money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, you're really not
because you're burning out your staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, it's and a big component to
that is now offering pay time off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself took vacation this summer for a
week, the last week of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have to be here for the July
1st deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Cassie just came back from
vacation herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us as directors, we get burnt out
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're working 50, 60 hour weeks
regularly and I'm traveling significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: for my job as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get burnt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm able to just step away to get
three or four day weekend and come back at
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I'm able to just my productivity
scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've noticed that if it's doing that
for me, how could it not do that for the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of my staff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think another thing unique to H.R.
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think we're doing a lot of that I'm
not sure is happening in other
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries is performance evaluations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you sit down with me every couple
of months and I fill out the same form
[SPEAKER_02]: like ranking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like communication skills
and dependability, like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different things with places to comment on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this way, I can make sure I sit down
and I'm appreciative of my best employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can also help to develop
someone who's struggling because a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times as you're filling these things out,
you realize, OK, I'm frustrated with this
[SPEAKER_02]: employee because of her tardiness or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's all these other fabulous
skills that they bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you I reach her on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And having that one to one time and
mentorship and things like that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I feel like it's something I'm
teased by with my team, like we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to sit down and read this paper again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in general, it does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel more confident that they're
going to have time to to know how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, to ask me any questions,
to give me feedback about how,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the the company culture is
feeling for them, I think is really
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that I don't see a lot,
you know, that routine evaluations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people do them when somebody's
either troublesome or getting a raise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see it in the past with those two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which I do when I'm doing a written
warning, which is not very often when I
[SPEAKER_00]: do, I do a performance evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But largely, that's actually just as
important to me as it is to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows me that when I go into this
having this conversation, that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it from a perspective where I'm
like, I'm mad about this specific thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it allows for me to give much more
constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're doing wonderful in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I see the skills that you're applying
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take those same skills and apply it to
this area so that you can fill that
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's causing you to have this
write up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So performance evaluations aren't even
they're not just necessary quarterly or
[SPEAKER_00]: every couple of months or depending on the
employee status is even it's used to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the the manager to have a better
discussion about the changes that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to see in the employee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one thing I just kind of
touched on a little bit that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: important is I also really appreciate
feedback from my customer assistants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear what their thoughts are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard so many creative and innovative
ideas in these meetings, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're not always sure how to speak
up about, hey, you know, at my old job,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had inventory and we did it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not always sure how to talk to me
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the performance evaluation is that
perfect time when they have my undivided
[SPEAKER_02]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuff really comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's really important
because it allows you to see who your
[SPEAKER_02]: staff really is, because not everybody is
super extroverted and like going to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: you over the head with their skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people need a little bit
more development and they still have great
[SPEAKER_02]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still should be implementing them,
but they just don't always feel confident
[SPEAKER_02]: in talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking that time to sit down one on
one, you can really get a feel for who
[SPEAKER_02]: your best team members are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.
Thank you.
