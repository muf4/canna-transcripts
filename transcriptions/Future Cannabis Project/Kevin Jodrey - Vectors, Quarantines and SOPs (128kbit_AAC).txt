[SPEAKER_00]: So if I chemically treat, I can control
most all pathogen problems, but cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is so regulated that it creates this
situation where you have to be hyper clean
[SPEAKER_00]: to the degree that like when I show up at
jobs and I'm like, are you gonna dress me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, no, no, we know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I'm a fucking vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where's my contamination shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people are not aware of
the fact that, you know, like the aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, that's our special guest of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The multiplication rate of that thing is
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the aphid family, even though we're
working with a different type of aphid,
[SPEAKER_00]: root aphids changed French wine forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wiped out an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to go to American root stock,
which they didn't want to do because they
[SPEAKER_00]: had to admit that the pathogen came from
America like 1870.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes over, smashes the whole French
industry, they have to go to American root
[SPEAKER_00]: stock because they had resistant
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed an entire industry because no
one could deal with the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still is that issue where you still
can't use specific grapes in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: regions because the moisture level in the
soil just allows them to flourish and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are non-resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bring in this aphid issue and it is
deadly in an operation if you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: having a container containment that's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think anybody really designed
the operations to have that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: sterility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the cleanest ops I know is
the, it's an indoor, but it's a Wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: Brex op down in Long Beach where you have
to go through basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: blow tubes to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like you're going into like
a virology lab, but that's the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be able to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's the change is that
on these massive mega operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to have to rethink the whole
workflow, containment, who goes where,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's allowed to be where and how you
absolutely keep yourself protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you get an infestation and
canopy that dense, there's nothing you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't bring in any kind of predation
that's going to outcompete the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction rate of any of these
predatory problems for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, and I think they drink some
of the shit that we're allowed to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, these fucking aphids like
thrive on some of the shit we use to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know what it is,
but I don't want to name any names to some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these products, but there's only a few
of them you can use in the late flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's at the point where I
think the aphids, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: just drink that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them die, but they multiply so
fucking fast that it just, it blows the
[SPEAKER_01]: doors off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You scream.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets to, uh, so you sent me a
picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a special guest, but,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk about kind of just in
case you brought them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just quickly, do you want to talk about
some of the stuff you've seen and
[SPEAKER_02]: operations you've consulted on and kind of
some standard operating procedures and
[SPEAKER_02]: best practices for bringing things in from
the outside, which typically is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, clones and cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, there has to be a
quarantine for a portion of the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're bringing in stuff in for
intake, and then you got to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: look stuff over pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and whether you're using,
you know, I just posted a little story of
[SPEAKER_01]: a little microscope thing that isn't a
fancy microscope like Scott use,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, it cooks up to your computer or
you can use like a jeweler's type of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, microscope handheld deal that you go
around and a lot of the PCAs and regular
[SPEAKER_01]: ag use these things and you just look at
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's just a lot of
looking at these clones when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing them in because you know,
every nursery has a little something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no getting around some of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so no matter how hard they try,
you have to try just as hard and not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, kind of waiver on thinking
that things are clean when they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because you can look at 30 different
leaves all around all these trays and it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes, you know, one leaf to finally find
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people give up on five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, you know, it's a tremendous
amount of looking at things, paying
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily my, uh,
you know, my, my original deal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've just been a lot of it lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so communicating with a lot of the
farms and people that I work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: even up in Humboldt, it's not just in the,
you know, a Valley type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens to be all over like I'm
talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you talk to people, you know,
at least when I talk to them one on one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people are say straight up,
yeah, I'm having problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This situation this year, some people
blame it on the big rains we had two years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago that all of a sudden, you know,
brought in all the aphids after the
[SPEAKER_01]: drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's all these folklore going
around or whatever, but nevertheless
[SPEAKER_01]: they're here and they multiply fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter where you are in
cannabis, this state, that state up North,
[SPEAKER_01]: down South or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes back also to the viroid,
you know, it's, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the viroid for the plants, whatever you
want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dudding is a huge problem too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a big vector for bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a generational thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been transferred around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the people that found this
viroid don't want to say, or say bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: don't transmit this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a few people that I really
believe in online and stuff that I follow
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're deep into bugs and they say
that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of agree with them because it's
another vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing, the thing that people have to
realize acquiring quarantine too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, is you're not just quarantining
shit you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I like, I'll give a plug to the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wish they gave me the
microscope, but I love my little dino
[SPEAKER_00]: light because it plugs into my pad and it
gives me a big screen to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really efficient, but that
doesn't let me look at viral issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem that people would bring
new plants in is it's not just pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to multiply in that form,
but it's in viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you bring that plant into the
facility, anything you cut a touch and
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer sap, you can transfer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you start to move it into your
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you realize what you've
done, you've reduced your overall TURP
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, potency levels, resistance,
anything that it has to do with sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that what people don't do
is they get new plants and they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: send out tissue sample of those plants to
a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 150 bucks and you can get a
virus analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do your diligence on
searching the plant for things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can visibly see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you let the lab search it for
things that you can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, you have a plant that's
pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's priceless, then you send it
off to a lab and get it Meristem cultured,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them scrub it, let them return it to
you clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't have any virus issues,
it doesn't need to be Meristem scrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can save yourself the five grand,
but you got to make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked people all the time when I go
to these jobs, I said, who picked the
[SPEAKER_00]: library?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you growing these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, cause this is what was here
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what's the basis of the
choice?
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one can answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investors can't answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers can't answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you look at these things and you
just like, wait a second, there has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a really clear idea of what you're trying
to do with your production destiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can simplify it.
And then you can expand what you work
with.
But man, people take on so much
complexity.
They don't look at the problem clearly
enough.
And then when it moves out of that
quarantine into the nursery, then it's so
much more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can make these phenomenal
collections of 8,000 different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get core varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work with that, you know,
that you can understand that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that they have inherently with
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can simplify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can expand what you work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, people take on so much
complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look at the problem clearly
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it moves out of that
quarantine into the nursery, then it
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads into all the bays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even isolated in one bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in all the bays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just nonstop trying to sterilize the
space, bring new material in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm telling you, these things can hide
in a molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they pop out, they pop out with
like 8,000 children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brusset mites were considered deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the aphid makes all of these things
look really, really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the virus, the protocols now with some
of this stuff are insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that people can also,
you know, a lot of times these nurseries
[SPEAKER_01]: are kind of transparent on how they do
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might be able to pick up
nowadays on how well they're doing on
[SPEAKER_01]: containing their virus, because this shit
is no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's nurseries I know and
things, their protocols are insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, each mom has its own set of
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't transfer scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't take it with you anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays in a cup of bleach right there
near that plant or that specific area of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each plant has its own scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The de-leafing, when you're moving around
and de-leafing because you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: wounds there, I mean, it's just kind of
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of coincidental that
we're dealing with, you know, I know the
[SPEAKER_01]: dudding has been around for a while,
but now with this coronavirus and the HPL
[SPEAKER_01]: virus or whatever, everybody's getting
real fucking, you know, sanitary talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about drinking Clorox and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that if you're running these
nursery operations and you get this
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation and you release it into any of
these operations, the lawsuits are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to bury you alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that I noticed is that,
you know, every investment group has some
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys on the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lawsuits aren't hard to file when your
business partner is a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really starts to create issues
where the nurseries, and even if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house nursery, if it's your in-house
nursery, you have to treat it like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get sued because you're going to
end up killing your own business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for, you know, off-shoot nurseries
that provide to the public, the diligence
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to put together to make sure
they're protected because there'll be no
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiveness for the mistake because the
margins are so small that you can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In years past, we could make mistakes
because we were all in the learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all had a different level of
ability to what we could do because lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of legalization changed our ability to
actually put together stable
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that all that's in play,
man, it puts you in a hell of a vulnerable
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where the rise of the
labs are coming in, where the technology
[SPEAKER_00]: to get around these issues with orchid,
to get around it with banana, to get
[SPEAKER_00]: around it with strawberry, they had to go
that route because they couldn't control
[SPEAKER_00]: it any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to transfer it in our
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that that's important for
nursery operators to understand that the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that's coming out to deal with
these issues is expensive and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: simple to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to make sure you're clear
that that's going to be the future that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make the decision to be a
nursery operator, you develop partnerships
[SPEAKER_00]: with these groups or you become your own
laboratory based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of the conventional
agricultural practices we had in how we
[SPEAKER_00]: function prior are going to change
dramatically, just like socially with the
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this shit just changed the world
in a day.
Thank you very much.
