[SPEAKER_03]: two or three of you were on a panel at the
Emerald Cup just a few months ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: where Richard Mendelson was speaking on
cannabis appellations, and he said that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's almost like mining for gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not enough to find the gold,
whatever that is, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we're talking about cannabis,
but to be able to mine it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were words that I remember saying,
I have rough notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in thinking about that, you can see
that we're talking about science and so
[SPEAKER_03]: many different ways, the cultivars,
the standards and the practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started to read Appellations at the
Valley, Richard Mendelson's book,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a wonderful quote at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we go anywhere else,
I just think if we listen to these words
[SPEAKER_03]: here that he opened his book with,
it's a Robert Louis Stevenson quote.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very much a description about
wine and how wine is like mining.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we think about cannabis
cultivation, I think very much there are a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the same things here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is from the Rich California Earth,
and the quote is, the beginning of vine
[SPEAKER_03]: planting is like the beginning of mining
for precious metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wine grower also prospects.
[SPEAKER_03]: One corner of the land is another,
tried with one kind of grape after
[SPEAKER_03]: another.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the failure, that's better,
a third is best.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bit by bit, they grow up for their
clover show and their Lafite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those loads in pockets of earth,
more precious than the precious ores that
[SPEAKER_03]: yield inevitable fragrance and soft fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those virtuous bonanzas where the soil is
sublimated under the sun and stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: To something finer and where the wine is
bottled poetry.
[SPEAKER_03]: These lie undiscovered chaperone conceals,
thicket and bowers them and the miner
[SPEAKER_03]: chips the rock and wanders further and the
grizzly mesas undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they bide their hour awaiting their
Columbus and nature nurses and prepares
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The snack of California Earth shall linger
on the palate of your grandson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Louis Stevenson from the Silverado
Squatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we think about how this is very much
a science and that gold is not enough,
[SPEAKER_03]: but being able to mine it right,
I'd love to hand this over to Max Montrose
[SPEAKER_03]: and he'll lead us in a presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Max, please take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been really excited to see cannabis
Appalachians become a thing for many years
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is going to help family farmers in
the Emerald Triangle who deserve to prove
[SPEAKER_02]: that their cannabis is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how we do that is going to be
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think cannabis psalms can actually
play a really big role in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, a cannabis sommelier is pretty
darn new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to briefly explain what
it is and what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, interact with other
participants and answer any questions that
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I'll say is, you know,
us as the cannabis industry, we keep
[SPEAKER_02]: alluding to this thing that we know about,
which is this expertise, which is more
[SPEAKER_02]: than an expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's next level expert, which is a
sommelier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to tell you that the wine
community, it drives them crazy that we
[SPEAKER_02]: say cannabis sommelier and for many
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one thing that's true is this
expertise does exist throughout many other
[SPEAKER_02]: industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have wine, sommeliers,
you have beer cicerones, cheese mongers,
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee cuppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within the TRICOM Institute,
when we were developing, how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: certify someone who's actually an expert
in how dynamic cannabis is and how
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated it is and what is it actually?
[SPEAKER_02]: We came up with the term interpreting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for us, a cannabis somm is an
interpreter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're doing is we are
interpreting terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not just trying to pretend like
we're gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're detecting linalool versus
mercine, we're actually with the
[SPEAKER_02]: trigeminal nerve of your face,
you can detect if these varietals are
[SPEAKER_02]: either stimulating, sedative, or actually
in between that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis isn't one or the either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a massive spectrum with multiples in
between, as we all know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what cannabis psalms do is well,
it's actually very similar to a wine
[SPEAKER_02]: psalm, what interpreters do because
cannabis truly does have an appellation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has terroir, it has topicity,
vintages, historic family farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: pairings, tastings, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably closer cannabis and wine
than cannabis is to beer or coffee or
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese or any of those other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why it's meaningful that
there's such a thing as a cannabis psalm
[SPEAKER_02]: or an interpreter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some really big differences at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the biggest differences
is the wine industry is thousands of years
[SPEAKER_02]: old and the cannabis industry was born
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, there's tons of
problems, such as the strain name dilemma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the speciation dilemma, the fact that
our industry thinks that it's indica or
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa when it's neither.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another huge difference is, you know,
grapes is a perennial fruit that lives in
[SPEAKER_02]: the earth for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is an annual bush that lives one
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I actually have more questions than
I do answers in terms of how are we as an
[SPEAKER_02]: industry going to prove that the geography
of origin impacts the cannabis in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we test for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something I would love to dig
into in this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think at the end of the day,
the most important thing, and if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to move through some of these slides,
please feel free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the most important
differences between a wine expert and a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis expert is a wine expert is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is really cool that you can do
these incredible things, that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: taste that the topicity of the Russian
river in a Pinot Noir is unique due to the
[SPEAKER_02]: geographic origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to be a cannabis expert at
a really high level is very cool too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something more important than cool is
that it's important to have a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: expert in this time period because even
though we have legislatively mandated lab
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, and thank God that we do,
thank God we're testing for pesticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbials, and all the things,
typically labs don't look for what we
[SPEAKER_02]: consider to be quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically labs don't look for the flush,
insects, nutrient lock, nutrient overdose,
[SPEAKER_02]: if the cannabis is ripe or not,
or where on the spectrum between it being
[SPEAKER_02]: a stimulating drug or a sedative substance
is it lying well?
[SPEAKER_02]: And within, labs don't really do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we have the strain name
dilemma, because bud tenders aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: legislatively mandated to be trained,
licensed, or certified, like plumbers or
[SPEAKER_02]: people who cut hair or nails, it's
critical that we have people that have an
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to assess cannabis for its
qualitative features, what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, consumers have,
they know two things, not just a strain
[SPEAKER_02]: name and a THC percentage, but is this
product I'm about to consume okay for me
[SPEAKER_02]: to consume, and at what level?
[SPEAKER_02]: What level of the quality is this,
and how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I consume it, what's it gonna do
to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two really fundamental things,
and that's something that interpreting
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got courses, books, tools,
online, tons of stuff at the Trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something that you're looking at,
that was just shown below there,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that's our objective analysis for
grading cannabis quality for all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that labs typically don't look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a lot of those practices can do,
especially when it comes to topicity,
[SPEAKER_02]: is to know how and why cannabis varietals
that are grown in specific regions in
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California are important and
deserve labeling that's more meaningful
[SPEAKER_02]: than cannabis that isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, I believe that that has more to do
with quality, than it does with a strain
[SPEAKER_02]: name or the genealogy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm also not sure how we're gonna
prove the geographical origin,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm really excited to find out and
open it up to the other awesome experts
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have on the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, it was so great to hear your
perspective as the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just sagging right into how some
of the things that cannabis sommeliers
[SPEAKER_03]: look at, we have this set of regulations,
draft set of regulations for appellation
[SPEAKER_03]: that address things like cultivars,
practices, and standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so looking at the definition of
cultivar here, it's defined in section
[SPEAKER_03]: 9000A as a means, it means a cultivated
variety trade designation or strain of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hand this to you, Eleanor,
so that you could provide us with some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the key issues or things that we should
know about the state of cannabis genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: right now and how it relates to even just
cultivar selection and some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: concepts that a petitioning group might
have to look at when they're deciding what
[SPEAKER_03]: to do as it relates to an appellation
petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Max, you couldn't have teed me up
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so excited that you really worked so
hard on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for asking, how can we
really place these plants in the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment in which they're in?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my training is in population genetics
and my specialty has been in the
[SPEAKER_04]: intersection between agriculture and
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we see this intersection between
the place that plants are grown and the
[SPEAKER_04]: expression of the genes that are housed in
their genomes across all plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's particularly powerful in our
medicinal plants and our culinary plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that we love so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we look at cannabis,
we do have the strain name issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of diversity that's out
there, but we also know that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that hold tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have characteristics that everyone can
recognize.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have names that have historical meaning
and deep value because they point to the
[SPEAKER_04]: history of those plants as either a clone
that's been held in propagation for many
[SPEAKER_04]: years or as in a family or lineage of
plants that's been propagated and
[SPEAKER_04]: routinely selected for those individuals
that are displaying true to type.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what we see in the evolution of
all of our most special plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more we love them, the more diversity
we seem to have in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this can be seen in apples or grapes or
any of our other really beloved plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with cannabis, we have a situation
where the genetics has really been pushed
[SPEAKER_04]: forward in a major way because of its
history with prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have this irony that the
prohibition of cannabis has acted to
[SPEAKER_04]: really increase the diversity that we see
within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have a really amazing
opportunity now to step back and make
[SPEAKER_04]: definitions of those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we look at cultivar and one of
the most important fundamentals of the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire Appalachians program is the
definition of cultivars, whether you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to include them or disclude them in
your proposed Appalachian standard,
[SPEAKER_04]: you really need to have a definition of
what those plants are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so fundamentally, when we do this with
any plant, whether it's a new species or
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a cultivar that we've developed from
a population of plants, we do this through
[SPEAKER_04]: definitions that fundamentally include
herbaria, which press that plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: preserve the definitional qualities of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is a really important
fundamental first step is the defining of
[SPEAKER_04]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've started candor, which is an
herbarium that specializes in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: really specializes in documenting the
community's history with these plants to
[SPEAKER_04]: ownership of the community to those plants
and also make those definitions that make
[SPEAKER_04]: sense to the community that's been
stewarding those plants from the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so once you have those definitions,
you can move into what we as geneticists
[SPEAKER_04]: call a G by E experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically you take genetics and
you put them in specific environments that
[SPEAKER_04]: can either be the same environment or you
can put the same plants across many
[SPEAKER_04]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in doing that type of experiment,
you really link the expression of those
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics and the outward phenotype with
the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you take the genetics and the
environment into account so you can really
[SPEAKER_04]: understand how that environment is driving
the expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you take some of your hazes that
do really well in this beautiful coastal
[SPEAKER_04]: area and they need certain conditions and
you move them to North Carolina or to
[SPEAKER_04]: Arizona, you're going to have very
different plants in their expression
[SPEAKER_04]: because of that interaction between their
genetics and the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these are things that we really,
we know intuitively in our communities,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this plant grows well here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this plant doesn't do well here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's taking that information and then
also going the next step and doing these
[SPEAKER_04]: experiments that really look specifically
at how the environment and the genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: interact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to take a second,
Eleanor, to take us even deeper into some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the regulatory material.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the initial statement of reasons,
the CDFA noted that there is to some
[SPEAKER_03]: extent an uncertainty within cannabis
genetics, testing, just the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: account for what you have and to be able
to establish that it is in fact what you
[SPEAKER_03]: think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the CDFA noted here that the freedom
to require a prohibit list of cultivars
[SPEAKER_03]: allows the petitioners to self-define.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering, I've heard a few farmer
groups talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Tuomi will have something to say
about this as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be difficult for a petitioning
group to decide upon or to come to
[SPEAKER_03]: consensus about even what cultivars they
want to include in their petition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether or not they're going to
exclude cultivars altogether at all will
[SPEAKER_03]: be a fundamental and difficult decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what kinds of discussions have you had
with some of the farmers or the
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholder groups that are interested in
pursuing an appellation?
[SPEAKER_03]: And perhaps also I want to make sure that
I read the green box up so Tuomi can chime
[SPEAKER_03]: in as well on cultivar and what different
issues are farmers going to encounter
[SPEAKER_03]: here?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is maybe some concepts to keep in
mind and maybe some glimmers of hope as
[SPEAKER_03]: well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can quickly speak to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, prohibition has left the scientific
community out of the loop for a very long
[SPEAKER_04]: time and our agricultural sciences are
deeply under-invested at this moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's something that we see
picking up pace as we have more and more
[SPEAKER_04]: lifting of that veil of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the scientific aspects of cannabis
biology and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we will continue to learn more and
more and have more and more tools,
[SPEAKER_04]: scientific tools to understand not only
diversity in our agricultural proper
[SPEAKER_04]: yields within cannabis, but also our
global diversity of cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just to speak specifically about
the regs and in making those decisions
[SPEAKER_04]: about cultivars to include and not include
it's sometimes always easier to point to
[SPEAKER_04]: the things you don't want than to bring in
the things you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are other groups who
instead of having a very strong opinion
[SPEAKER_04]: about plants that should not be included,
they have a lot of really amazing plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that have been held in community have been
specifically selected to do well in their
[SPEAKER_04]: region.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those become natural plants to
include and they have a deep history,
[SPEAKER_04]: not only with the land itself being
selected on that land, but also with the
[SPEAKER_04]: communities that have taken care of those
plants as an annual and propagated them
[SPEAKER_04]: and moved them forward generation to
generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know Swami has a lot to say about
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to pass it over to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're talking about how the plant
responds to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, the cannabis plant is
known to be what they call a
[SPEAKER_01]: bioaccumulator or a phytoremediator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for you to know that there was an
experiment done after Chernobyl nuclear
[SPEAKER_01]: power plant and they planted hemp all
around it because the hemp pulled the
[SPEAKER_01]: nuclear radiation out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, you know what they say
in computers, garbage in garbage out,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same with cannabis, whatever's in
the soil and the plant is going to pull up
[SPEAKER_01]: a good bit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be reflected in the actual
flavor and the end of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what Max refers to as
insufficient flushing and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but there are ways of growing cannabis
that even flushing doesn't come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're talking about is legacy
growers here in the mountains all over
[SPEAKER_01]: California, not just in the Memorial
Triangle, but also down in Big Sur and
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz and over in Grass Valley and up
in the various mountains and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have their own traditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Eleanor was saying, over time,
we've found in various areas, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't grow that one on the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get powdery mildew and
don't grow that one over in Grass Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's so hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, being a judge in the Emerald Cup,
I really encounter a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: experts, people who know more than me in
so many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people out there who've been
buyers and clubs who have been growers for
[SPEAKER_01]: so many years or breeders, they can taste
something and they say, oh, that's that
[SPEAKER_01]: purple urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably crossed with that train
wreck or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have an amazing ability through
their nose and also through tasting the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual smoking to really pinpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have another friend who's like a
third generation been growing since he was
[SPEAKER_01]: 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he can pretty much tell you almost
which mountain it grew on from the shape
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bud and from all of the ways that
it's uniquely done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, in the old, old days up here
in the mountains and all over,
[SPEAKER_01]: people were crawling under the bushes with
maybe a bag of soil or maybe they just had
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil in the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were growing tiny plants and they
were saving their urine during the winter
[SPEAKER_01]: to use that for nitrogen fertilizer and so
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the old techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now nobody uses those anymore,
but that's where we come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, people have really
developed their techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a science and there's an
art also.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science of it has to do with,
we're now moving into what we know is
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative agriculture and things known
as the soil food web, living soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you are attempting to source
virtually all of your ingredients,
[SPEAKER_01]: either from your own farm or within the
immediate locality, then I've got wood
[SPEAKER_01]: chips from my oak trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got oak leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my worm bin over here and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are inputs that come from my
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they are now creating even more so
an association with the plant and its
[SPEAKER_01]: natural environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time, we talk about the biome,
the total environmental, herbal life
[SPEAKER_01]: around, but also the microbiome,
the living organisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those things have importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these become standards in the sense
of, do we say, okay, in Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a long tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody grew more than like 25 or 30
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas up in Humboldt, they always grew a
thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are like traditions that are
different within just across the county
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are kind of things that the
standards would be produced by the
[SPEAKER_01]: petitioners to say, well, in Mendon,
we might say, well, if you're growing more
[SPEAKER_01]: than half an acre, you don't deserve an
appellation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But up in Humboldt, they say, that's
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's been growing an acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things of like, does it have to be
hand trimmed or hand packed or do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to use integrated pest management?
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things become standards,
which then you see the thing is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant also is always responding to the
environment in the way it makes its
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So terpenes are a protective mechanism,
just like trichomes are a protective
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism to protect the plant and
especially its seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your environment is creating the threat
or the dangers to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant responds with its
terpenes, even in relation to its
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics will have a propensity for a
terpene, but the local environment will
[SPEAKER_01]: say that terpene is much more expressed or
much more potent, or maybe not even
[SPEAKER_01]: present actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kevin Jodry, a dear friend of mine,
he said he has two farms, one on the coast
[SPEAKER_01]: and one up at like 2000 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same strain, same program, everything
else, completely different plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way it expresses it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there just are people who really can
tell the difference and it's the nose that
[SPEAKER_01]: knows, but it's the, I call it the
ensemble, but actually with 500
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients, it's actually a symphony of
everything in there that's all working
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a whole way of judging this
and we're working on that and we're making
[SPEAKER_01]: that more precise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Swami.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried to switch around in some of the
slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see even having some of the
scientists and practitioners here speaking
[SPEAKER_03]: about it, that standards and practices
very much overlap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to save some time, Swami,
as well, when we talk about standards to
[SPEAKER_03]: invite you, as you started to discuss,
whether or not a baseline standard or a
[SPEAKER_03]: more explicit requirement of terroir would
be useful here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've spoken about how cannabis is this
bioaccumulator that expresses and pulls up
[SPEAKER_03]: so much of the natural environment,
sometimes the individual farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: but of course also both the microbiome and
the region itself and the natural world as
[SPEAKER_03]: it interacts with the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The standards are something that,
and the difference between standards and
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, I'm still trying to come to
grips with actually, standards that are
[SPEAKER_01]: measurable, certifiable or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the standards, like we could say,
well, I think we were hoping the state
[SPEAKER_01]: would come up with a baseline and the
baseline would be that it's in contact
[SPEAKER_01]: with the natural soil in the ground,
that it's in full sun and for the long
[SPEAKER_01]: season, is the way I like to say it,
that they say without artificial life in
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowering section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the French concept of terroir,
there is a statement that says no barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: between the plant and nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I think is the kind of key
concept, but also the other part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: concept is brought up several times is the
cultural or the fact of what the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up here in the mountains and all over
the place, if one farmer had a disaster,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the rats ate their starts,
the other farmers would give them starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone got raided by the police,
people would give them their shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this community up here that was
all a solid community because we all
[SPEAKER_01]: shared a risk in the prohibitive era.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's happening now, the community
split between those who come in to be
[SPEAKER_01]: legal and those who are still braving the
winds of fate and growing out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wilderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we used to be one community and
that's one of the issues we have to come
[SPEAKER_01]: across.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with standards now, we have to realize
what are the important standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we say for you to be in our group,
you have to be hand trimmed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be a standard, and that's
verifiable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not actually measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's measurable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe you say, okay, you have to
have like six feet between each plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can only grow, you can only have
like three to four pounds per plant as a
[SPEAKER_01]: stipulation to disqualify a certain thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of those kinds of specific
standards, practices and so on would be
[SPEAKER_01]: created by the group that comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with other speakers who say
three is too small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be more of a consensus of
several farmers in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe eight or nine, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it's hard to bring people
together to agree on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over the years, everyone has kind of
figured out what grows up here and the
[SPEAKER_01]: best way to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I say, so many people are moving
into regenerative farming that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually an expression of not just the
soil, but of a state of consciousness
[SPEAKER_01]: about how we can repair the earth of the
world by using regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: methods rather than chemical salt-based
fertilizer methods that are mostly used
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And industrial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just wanted to take that point
to loop it back to that quote that we were
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I think of mining,
I actually think of it being extractive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think of it being, you know,
damaging to the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, when we're talking about this
intricate gold mining, working with the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, this interaction, the essential and
exclusive potentially between,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the farmer intermediating his
environment and working with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we bring in regenerative agriculture
principles, those standards, if people
[SPEAKER_03]: choose them, then it almost is not so much
extractive, but being back in balance and
[SPEAKER_03]: even more of something to help the natural
environment continue to flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's, you know, the pollinators or
anyhow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give that natural segue to Alec
Dixon, because I know that he has many
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts on these issues as well in terms
of what he sees even now with testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whether there's certain kinds of
terpenes that appear in more isolated
[SPEAKER_03]: areas where there isn't big ag presence to
even, you know, what a farm might do
[SPEAKER_03]: individually to have, you know,
these broader terpenes or other
[SPEAKER_03]: expressions within, you know, the ultimate
product from their place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and Alec as well, you may have
some thoughts about what Swami shared on
[SPEAKER_03]: the bioaccumulator aspect of the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dive right in, Alec.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, yeah, it's an honor to be on this
panel, part of this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really exciting, progressive
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the whole community can learn
more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to jump in on a few areas,
you know, one, you know, kind of around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis classification around terpenes
and understanding and having a more
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated understanding of that to
really start to define what cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: actually exist within the cannabis plant
pool and genetic pool and chemometric
[SPEAKER_00]: pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kind of from there, kind of
getting into organic agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and ways of with regional
superiority, how, you know, these really
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced kind of, you know, team with
microbe approaches kind of can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: help to, you know, double secondary
metabolite production within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, whenever it's grown in
various ways in various regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, from there,
there's the whole conversation around the
[SPEAKER_00]: bio accumulation properties of this plant
and, you know, the extreme kind of testing
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations that are put in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to start kind of on the on
the chemometrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, at SC Laboratories,
you know, we've been open, kind of testing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis exclusively, you know,
for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the time, we've done and ran
over, you know, one hundred and twenty
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand terpene tests on strains of
cannabis that we've tested and came
[SPEAKER_00]: across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the recent years, you know,
we started working with bioinformaticists
[SPEAKER_00]: and data statisticians to help us to
cluster the data to understand more about
[SPEAKER_00]: the nuances of the conversation around
Indica hybrid sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, although we're testing
currently 35 terpenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there are hundreds of compounds and
ultra trace amounts that are expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, really, what we see with
cannabis classification is about five to
[SPEAKER_00]: nine terpenes that essentially define 99
percent of everything we've ever tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from understanding more about the
primary secondary attributes and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: with regard to terpenes, we can really
start to dive in to understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars actually exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what we see from all the the
sorting of data is there's about five
[SPEAKER_00]: primary smell groups and each primary
smell group then has two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: subgroups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can kind of think of it like
wine system whites and red wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the various grapes
that are in each of those categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, we see about five primary
sub primary groups, you know, two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: subgroups is about 10 to 12 archetype
profiles that essentially define
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we've ever tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, you can really start to
understand obscurity and rarity and what
[SPEAKER_00]: what types of really, really unique
profiles that the plant produces that are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeming to be related to land race,
your recessive traits that are within
[SPEAKER_00]: various strains from around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so kind of taking it from there,
you know, like we then see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, you know, on the back so much of
the work of, you know, kind of the great
[SPEAKER_00]: aligning soil food web and the really
advanced pursuit to understand how to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize organic farming practices in the
teaming with microbes approach to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, biomimicry, you know,
helping to recreate, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of the work of the soil food web
has really helped to begin substantiating
[SPEAKER_00]: through science and through testing on
various secondary metabolites produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, terpenes being cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary metabolite, but seeing kind of
how advanced organic practices can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, you know, increase in double,
you know, secondary metabolite production
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant, you know, very much
based on region, very much based on
[SPEAKER_00]: organic practices and is not as broad as a
whole county, but is very kind of myopic
[SPEAKER_00]: to an individual farming practices level
or the surrounding farmers in that region
[SPEAKER_00]: that have kind of gained so much
experience in serving this plant over such
[SPEAKER_00]: a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of, you know, segue in that a
little bit, you know, kind of from
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and kind of, you know,
the expression of what we see and how
[SPEAKER_00]: organic practices can enhance,
you know, these secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by the plant grown in various
regions, you know, kind of then kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into the conversation around cannabis
as a bioaccumulating plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this plant is the great
bioaccumulator of the 21st century and we
[SPEAKER_00]: are now testing it to a level that nothing
has ever been tested for quality assurance
[SPEAKER_00]: around public health and safety and for
different chemometric markers to help
[SPEAKER_00]: identify quality and substantiate kind of,
you know, market value in various ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to bioaccumulation and
further QA concerns with contaminants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we, you know, it's a really
fascinating kind of see from the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: level because, you know, right now we're
almost beginning to start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: California splitting up into, you know,
red zones, yellow zones and green zones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which really start to define and
highlight the various difficulties,
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerabilities and massive opportunities
that exist for farmers in various regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start talking about,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Alec, I just wanted to add there
because when we were talking about even
[SPEAKER_03]: how to show this data or this image,
you provided me with a slide of an area in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Central Valley that are like,
we didn't include it here, but you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: you could describe it maybe, you know,
areas where there's just all sorts of EPA
[SPEAKER_03]: violations and the like, and then,
you know, a whole mountain range on the
[SPEAKER_03]: other side with nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wonder, looking at this 9106
geographical features, one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that petitioners will need to show is
that, at least as the regs stand now,
[SPEAKER_03]: under B, 9106B, substantial evidence that
the geographical area is distinctive when
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to areas outside the proposed
boundary and other relevant areas which
[SPEAKER_03]: produce cannabis for sale in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're from the Central Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent some time there with different
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had lots of conversations about
this, even just in, you know, your region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine, you know, being able to
establish that geographical boundary where
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see, for example, an isolated
area, a canyon that's away from Big Ag,
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe doesn't have some of the things
that we're talking about, pesticides and
[SPEAKER_03]: other contaminants, and is maybe more
pristine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in so many ways, you know,
now that cannabis is being tested at this
[SPEAKER_00]: level for compliance testing with any
product failing, having to be remediated
[SPEAKER_00]: or destroyed, you know, over thousands of
these kind of fails going back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of 2018, we've really begun to
start to kind of create a map overlay of
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that are, you know, under
incredible threat to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on behalf of our four cannabis farms and
farmers growing in these regions because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the history of the land, because of the
agriculture practices that were taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place long before they were farming there
or from the neighboring regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the way the farmers till their soil
and kick up metals that can then
[SPEAKER_00]: completely fail an entire cannabis crop
just from that simple act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, in so many ways, what we're,
you know, the cannabis appellation
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation to me is really fascinating
because through the lens of testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so much of what we've seen is
really kind of starting to show,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of the avenues and the
pathways for people's success and small
[SPEAKER_00]: craft farmers, artisan producers have been
doing this all their life with the rich
[SPEAKER_00]: and vast experience to grow this annual
plant that is, you know, very harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: specific and very, very, very sensitive to
actually have an opportunity to really
[SPEAKER_00]: shine in this time where there's,
you know, massive, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: effort to monocrop this plant and to kind
of commercialize it in such a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a lot of ways, yeah,
through the testing kind of we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to see kind of how much is being
affected, how much cannabis farmers are
[SPEAKER_00]: being affected from being planted in these
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in so many ways, it's not that all
areas of ag land in Salinas or in kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of in Santa Barbara or in
Stanislaus County, anywhere where ag takes
[SPEAKER_00]: place, you know, presents a unique sets of
challenges to any farmer that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis in so many ways through being
this bioaccumulator and kind of helping to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell the story, it's really beginning to,
you know, uproot a lot of the history and
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy of the green revolution and
chemical induced approach to ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process, I think it's also
going to be very much beginning to help
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate the slow food movement,
decentralized agricultural approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding where your food comes from,
where your medicine comes from,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, holding food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all other industries to a new
standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Alec.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting thumbs up from Swami.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we've all had these dialogues
a couple of different times in different
[SPEAKER_03]: ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great place to leave it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we have any last minute, last notes,
Blake, or that's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the proof is in the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Max says the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's telling you,
because the nose, the terpenes give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: precognition of what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that will tell you what's going to
be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes are the fine pointing of the
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: The terpenes are the fine pointing of the
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait to learn more about the
research Alec is doing with SC Labs in
[SPEAKER_02]: these terpene testing and the culmination
of the types, because interpreting has
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered that there's kind of five
cannabis types as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's terpene dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the trigeminal nerve can detect
where that spectrum is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to hang out with you and
compare data and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Swami, I can't wait to smoke one with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Eleanor, I want to learn more about
the awesome research you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody on this panel is really doing
the coolest, coolest research that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: most meaningful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very proud of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you all just so much for,
yeah, for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just such a cool thing to be a
part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to do a brief introduction
for each of these great panelists that
[SPEAKER_03]: have stayed the course and are here to
lend their wisdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, I'm going to share a quote
or two that I think will guide us through
[SPEAKER_03]: this and then we'll let Max Montrose take
it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this panel, Science and Sommelier,
comes from a couple of different angles.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Alec Dixon, who is one of the
co-founders of SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is the director of client relations.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has five years as a consultant in the
hydroponic industry, formerly serving in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Navy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an outreach director for Veterans for
Medical Marijuana and on the board of the
[SPEAKER_03]: director of the Women and Men's Alliance
for Medical Marijuana at Santa Cruz,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the longest running compassion
programs in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of intersection here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have Max Montrose from the
Trichome Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a cannabis sommelier, an educator,
an interpeener.
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be explaining what interpeening
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is someone who both provides cannabis
education and even certification as it
[SPEAKER_03]: relates to cannabis sommeliership.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I invite you, Max, as well to fill in
more, since I know there's so much that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can share there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Swami Chaitanya is also joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a cultivator in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a journalist, an advocate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've done extensive work with the
Mendocino Cannabis Alliance and serves on
[SPEAKER_03]: the Board of Origins Council.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the pleasure of visiting his farm
where he and his partner, Nikki Lestretto,
[SPEAKER_03]: farm under the full sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some in native soil, many other things to
learn from Swami.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to learn more,
I really enjoyed seeing him on the news
[SPEAKER_03]: hour with his partner, Nikki, for their
farm and their cultivation, their brand,
[SPEAKER_03]: Swami Select.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last but certainly not least,
we have Eleanor Kuntz from Leafworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the CEO and co-founder and also the
founder of Candor Herbarium, which I
[SPEAKER_03]: understand is one of the world's cannabis
herbariums, which I think is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: serve these herbariums will serve a
pivotal role in doing some of the work
[SPEAKER_03]: we're talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is a PhD geneticist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a lot more to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, Eleanor, when we get to you,
fill that in as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with all of those bios, and so much
more could be said, thank you so much.
Thank you.
