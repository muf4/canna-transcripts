[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an update on the auto flower
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the flowers are starting to
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's June 10th, so they've been going
since April 24th.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to show you is the shining
model of polyculture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't necessarily know if carrots
would be able to be planted with the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, but as you can clearly see,
they are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's different types of
carrots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are smaller fingerlings and some are
bigger, but they've been working and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carrots are acting as a banker plant
system for the lady beetles reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's another one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen quite a few breeding along this
border here of carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, see there's a lady beetle larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an integrated model of
polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Humboldt Seed Company's Magic Melon
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrots on one border flanked by
chamomile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chamomile is also to attract beneficial
insects and it is used to extract as
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also make a sun tea with the
chamomile just by harvesting the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them in water in a glass jar,
letting them sit in the sun for 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that extract can be used as a
foliar feed for your plants or as a
[SPEAKER_00]: drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's traditionally used for seeds and
preventing damping off in seedlings as an
[SPEAKER_00]: antifungal spray for damping off in
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's traditionally used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chamomile does have, I believe,
quite a bit of calcium in it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an integrated functioning
polyculture system with herbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show you guys it actually
works and it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
