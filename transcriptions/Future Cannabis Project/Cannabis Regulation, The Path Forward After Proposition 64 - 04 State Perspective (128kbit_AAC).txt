[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a couple things
mentioned, transport, track and trace.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we'll bring out the folks from the
state perspective that are going to have
[SPEAKER_09]: to do all the regulations for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go ahead and bring up at this
time, Laurie Ajax, Chief for the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_09]: Medical Cannabis Regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim Houston, the Under Secretary for the
Department of Food and Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dr. Karen Smith.
[SPEAKER_09]: Director and State Public Health Officer
for the Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Laurie Ajax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Bureau Chief for the Bureau of
Medical Cannabis Regulation under the
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Consumer Affairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today I'm going to focus my brief
presentation on implementing the Medical
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act and
Proposition 64 and then provide a status
[SPEAKER_03]: of the regulations and our timelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under these new laws, the Bureau is
responsible for the licensing and
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement of the distributors,
the transporters, the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: testing labs, and the micro businesses
under Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also the lead agency to coordinate
the efforts with the other licensing
[SPEAKER_03]: authorities with Department of Food and Ag
and Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to the many other,
there's many other state agencies involved
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're working with on quite a
frequent basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our priorities in implementing both
statute is the protection of the public,
[SPEAKER_03]: the patient, and the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to know that right from the
start, when we first started the Bureau,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got staffed at the Bureau in February of
last year and we decided that one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: most important things we wanted to get out
in front of the public and listen to their
[SPEAKER_03]: concern, learn about the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did informational tours across
the state from nine of them across the
[SPEAKER_03]: state just to meet with the public and a
lot of the people that were there were
[SPEAKER_03]: local government, patients, the public,
law enforcement, and the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went as far north as Arcata and all the
way down to San Diego to these
[SPEAKER_03]: informational sessions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really beneficial for us to learn
about the concerns of the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: of the public, and we got a lot of
feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then followed that up with our
pre-regulatory meetings that we did last
[SPEAKER_03]: year in September of October.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to eight locations across the
state and we actually floated some
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory concepts and actually got
involved with, we had a small group
[SPEAKER_03]: discussions to actually get feedback on
what's the best way to go forward with the
[SPEAKER_03]: developing of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a lot of listening, we did a lot
of asking of questions, and now we're at a
[SPEAKER_03]: point at our pre-regulatory stakeholders
in total we had over 2,000 people attend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're at a point with the other two
licensing authorities that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: developing the medical regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We plan to notice those with the Office of
Administrative Law early spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of us will be noticing our
medical regulations and then we'll kick
[SPEAKER_03]: off the 45 day comment period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll also be holding hearings across
the state to take public comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We feel like a lot of what we have
developed in the medical side is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: align very well with the proposition 64
regulations that we also have to develop,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least where there are similarities.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you all know, there's some key
differences between the two statutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for those differences, we are going
to see what happens during the legislative
[SPEAKER_03]: process and then we plan to use the
emergency regulation authority that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have under both the medical and the adult
use side and notice our regulations for
[SPEAKER_03]: the adult use coming up approximately in
September.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure that we see what
happens through legislation and then go
[SPEAKER_03]: forward with developing those regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the status of our timelines and
I'm happy to answer any questions you
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure there will be plenty of
questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms. Ajax.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you for taking the time to meet
with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the sit down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Houston, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chair and Madam Chair,
members.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jim Houston.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the Undersecretary of the California
Department of Food and Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been echoed by my colleague.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both the passage of Mercursa and Prop 64
has presented new challenges to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Food and Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, we're responsible for
the licensing of the grow sites and
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement of medical and adult use
cannabis throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: With particular consideration given to
CEQA, so the California Environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the lead agency for purposes of that
licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, we're also responsible for
developing the track and trace system that
[SPEAKER_02]: will be used from seed to sale to track
the cannabis both through its flower state
[SPEAKER_02]: and then whatever sort of machinations
occur after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of our regulatory work,
we are sort of lock step with our other
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We held eight listening sessions
throughout the state all up and down,
[SPEAKER_02]: both in the north and the south and the
central.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of those occurred with other agencies
in tow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some did, some did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We likewise have been proceeding
expeditiously and plan to submit our
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations and plans in early spring to
OAL.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already prepared our economic
analysis, otherwise known as a CERIA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's with Mercursa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parallel to that is the CEQA timeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be shortly releasing our draft
environmental impact report.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go early spring and then that will
sort of begin the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've built in a lot of public comment for
both of those and plan on submitting those
[SPEAKER_02]: late fall around November for their final
disposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in August, likewise, we plan on
using our emergency regulatory authority
[SPEAKER_02]: to implement Prop 64 as it's been
expressed both in legislature and here and
[SPEAKER_02]: in other hearings and will continue to be
discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The harmonization between Mercursa and
Prop 64 is dynamic and occurring and so we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be able to adapt and put in any of
those changes in August so that we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to sort of unwind the clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So August, use the emergency and then we
will follow that up with regular rule
[SPEAKER_02]: making as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also presents a unique challenge
for us that is CEQA, because we have our
[SPEAKER_02]: Mercursa CEQA and then we also have to do
Prop 64 CEQA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thankfully, we believe we'll be able
to utilize the information that's in our
[SPEAKER_02]: Mercursa CEQA analysis, apply that to our
Prop 64 analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while there are some differences,
we believe that that overlap will allow us
[SPEAKER_02]: to meet the January 1, 2018 deadline.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is currently an RFP out to do the
consulting work for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we anticipate that should be wrapped up
shortly and then we will begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will say I've been very, very
impressed with the level of coordination
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've had and the level of dialogue
that we've had with both yourselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholders, and our sister agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so look forward to seeing this through
to completion and happy to answer any
[SPEAKER_02]: questions you may have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there will be questions as well,
especially around mass cultivation and
[SPEAKER_09]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms. Smith, please.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Smith.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good afternoon, Chairs, or good
morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee members, I'm Dr. Karen Smith.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the State Public Health Officer and
the Director of the California Department
[SPEAKER_05]: of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today I'm going to talk briefly about the
Department of Public Health's
[SPEAKER_05]: implementation of the Medical Cannabis
Regulation Safety Act and Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you all know, the Medical Cannabis
Regulation Safety Act and 64 both mandate
[SPEAKER_05]: the Department of Public Health to license
and oversee medical and adult use cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: product manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The departments approach these regulations
with the intent of creating strong
[SPEAKER_05]: foundation for the protection of public
health and safety without making the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory compliance so onerous that
manufacturers of the cannabis products
[SPEAKER_05]: would choose to remain in the underground
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're drafting regulations that are
substantially similar to the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_05]: practices currently in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: For food manufacturers, and the regs will
include things along the lines of
[SPEAKER_05]: licensing requirements, process control,
security, safety, sanitation, destruction,
[SPEAKER_05]: labeling, packaging, product standards,
and compliance enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: We developed the regulations to include
those substantially similar both to food,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also to dietary supplements,
because there are things about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: being added to food products that are very
similar to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: From microbial contamination,
contamination by employees, or the
[SPEAKER_05]: environment, to incorporation of foreign
elements like glass, hair, or insects,
[SPEAKER_05]: to contamination of a product with
unintended allergens.
[SPEAKER_05]: The manufacturing processes provide
numerous opportunities for hazards to be
[SPEAKER_05]: introduced.
[SPEAKER_05]: The minimum facility requirements and
standard operating procedures for sanitary
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturing established by the
department's proposed regulations are
[SPEAKER_05]: intended to reduce or eliminate potential
contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: The regulations also limit the product
that are allowed to be infused with
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis because certain types of
manufactured products are more susceptible
[SPEAKER_05]: to microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: The department's highest priority in
implementing the act and Proposition 64 is
[SPEAKER_05]: the protection of the public's health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on feedback that we received from
stakeholders, the department is
[SPEAKER_05]: contemplating additional license types
beyond those allowed for in the current
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of which is an additional license type
for businesses that only manufacture
[SPEAKER_05]: products such as edibles but don't conduct
the extractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the plant, and then a second license
type for businesses that do not
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacture the actual product,
but package and label them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have extensive experience in the food
manufacturing processing and safety,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the cannabis industry is new to us as
well as others.
[SPEAKER_05]: We estimate that there will be
approximately 1,000 applications for
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis manufacturing,
and potentially as much as twice that for
[SPEAKER_05]: the adult use.
[SPEAKER_05]: This required us to quickly develop an
understanding of this entirely new
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, which is evolving very rapidly,
as I think you're all aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of the nature of the industry,
there isn't a great deal of data actually
[SPEAKER_05]: available, so it becomes difficult to
verify.
[SPEAKER_05]: To educate ourselves, we met with numerous
industry representatives and associations,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the department staff visited
manufacturing sites of various types
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout the state to learn more about
extractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And manufacturing processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The staff also had numerous calls with
other states who have implemented similar
[SPEAKER_05]: programs.
[SPEAKER_05]: During the pre-regulatory stakeholder
meetings, we also heard from local health
[SPEAKER_05]: jurisdictions and others within the local
jurisdictions who represent.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are very clear about their desire to
both maintain some level of local control
[SPEAKER_05]: and that they are important partners in
the regulatory process.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is consistent with the way we
practice in food manufacturing and other
[SPEAKER_05]: activities in the department.
[SPEAKER_05]: Timeline completion of the regulatory
packages is also a top priority for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been coordinating, as has been
said before, we also are on the same
[SPEAKER_05]: timeline.
[SPEAKER_05]: We anticipate releasing the medical
cannabis regulations for public comment in
[SPEAKER_05]: the early spring and full adoption by
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of the compressed timeline,
we also anticipate using the emergency
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory process for the adult use
regulations, which will substantially be
[SPEAKER_05]: the same as Proposition 64, although there
are some differences that will need to be
made.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be addressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for the opportunity to share
our progress and plans and implementation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm happy to answer any questions that
you may have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your testimony.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's figure out, maybe we'll start
with you, Dr. Smith, and then we'll work
[SPEAKER_09]: our questions all the way through.
[SPEAKER_09]: And first, I appreciate the time as we
were trying to grapple with some of these
[SPEAKER_09]: issues, some of the things you touched
upon.
[SPEAKER_09]: The packaging, the food manufacturing,
because I believe you're just looking at
[SPEAKER_09]: this because even from the food
manufacturing, making sure that the public
[SPEAKER_09]: is safe because that's your charge to make
sure that things are safe for the public
[SPEAKER_09]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: But can you talk a little bit more about
how we're trying to standardize that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we had this discussion,
but I'd like to put it on the record.
[SPEAKER_09]: Standardizing, so if you go to one
dispensary as opposed to another,
[SPEAKER_09]: that you're still receiving the same
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how does that relate to potency?
[SPEAKER_09]: And what does that mean for an individual?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a broad variety of regulations
that touch on that, some of which are with
[SPEAKER_05]: us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And dispensaries themselves are within the
local control, so we don't regulate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, sanitary practice is part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One overarching safety measure that we are
going to propose is that we only will
[SPEAKER_05]: allow cannabis infusion of shelf-stable
food products because of the possibility
[SPEAKER_05]: for foods that require refrigeration or
some other level of maintenance under
[SPEAKER_05]: particular characteristics at the local
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most dispensaries are not prepared to do
that and it becomes a much more difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: thing for local jurisdictions to actually
regulate that on a dispensary by
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's one of the things that we're
going to propose in the regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is we will be proposing
maximum THC levels in products,
[SPEAKER_05]: edible products in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as topical products, because we
believe that one of the most important
[SPEAKER_05]: things for us is making sure that children
in particular who may inadvertently
[SPEAKER_05]: consume a product that looks like a food
product that they're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we maintain a package so that it
doesn't have so much THC in it that the
[SPEAKER_05]: child ends up in an emergency room or the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been examples in other states
of, well, pediatric poisonings actually
[SPEAKER_05]: increased dramatically in Colorado after
they originally put it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing we'll be doing,
obviously, is a great deal of public
[SPEAKER_05]: education about how to use this product
safely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know that's a concern.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the questions I also get back home
is some people know what they classify as
[SPEAKER_09]: the good shops, and this one's more potent
than the other, so I'm glad that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: looking into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have a number of questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have additional questions as well,
but let me go ahead and defer to some of
[SPEAKER_09]: my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really briefly, and it may not
totally fall under your jurisdiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but folks under section eight housing and
people who need to apply for that or are
[SPEAKER_00]: on the waiting list, it's actually illegal
for them to use marijuana because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal saying that's an illegal narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an issue looming and it's
disenfranchising people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks may not even know that who are
needing section eight housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to kind of bring that up
and I didn't know if it was under the
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Wood has a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Public health question.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I want to say that I
appreciate the opportunity we met with you
[SPEAKER_08]: and the work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very impressed with the work and the
thought that's gone into where you are so
[SPEAKER_08]: far.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also appreciate the fact that you're
not trying to be overly onerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the industry is going to take a
while for people to get up and running
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the worst thing we can do is
be overly onerous on a lot of these,
[SPEAKER_08]: so that would give people an opportunity
to actually come into compliance with
[SPEAKER_08]: reasonable best practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do have a question, two questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one is, how are we going to reconcile
some of the oversight issues?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because MCRSA was pretty particular about
Department of Public Health's role and
[SPEAKER_08]: then Prop 64 has changed that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there room for reconciliation on
that one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we clearly, after studying that
six months, the governor's office had a
[SPEAKER_08]: very different vision of how things should
be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, really the only place where that
comes up is in the oversight of the
[SPEAKER_05]: testing laboratories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are assisting the bureau with the
development of the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations for the testing laboratories.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually do believe that it will be
possible through legislation to align the
[SPEAKER_05]: two.
[SPEAKER_05]: The drafters of Prop 64 didn't
intentionally, our understanding is put it
[SPEAKER_05]: back to the California Department of
Public Health, they were working from an
[SPEAKER_05]: early version of the Medical Cannabis Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason for moving the testing
laboratories really was to facilitate the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Distributors are the entity within the
process who actually take the product,
[SPEAKER_05]: the original product to the testing
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now distributors and all other
licenses except the very specific
[SPEAKER_05]: agricultural license and manufacturing
licenses are with the bureau.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was the conclusion of the group that
the best alignment is to have it with the
[SPEAKER_05]: bureau.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also DCA has far more experience in
licensing complex types of entity than we
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we would anticipate working very
closely with them over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's likely that given the science of
testing is developing that we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: want to be looking at the regulations over
time for the laboratories.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that that's a resolvable
complex.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my final question from a public
health perspective, become aware of the
[SPEAKER_08]: infusion of cannabis in a variety of foods
and things.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yesterday was brought up to me,
and this may be a question for everybody,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is going to oversee the infusion of
cannabis in spirits and wine, which is
[SPEAKER_08]: happening out there?
[SPEAKER_08]: And how is that going to play out?
[SPEAKER_05]: So our proposed regulations are not going
to allow the infusion of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol products into alcohol products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's based on science that
demonstrates that two depressive effects,
[SPEAKER_05]: which both marijuana and alcohol are both
central nervous system depressants,
[SPEAKER_05]: actually can potentiate.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also very early information that
there can be very real consequences of
[SPEAKER_05]: that playing out, particularly in the
realm of automobile accidents.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a recent study done by law
enforcement in Colorado looking at fatal
[SPEAKER_05]: automobile accidents and using autopsy
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they found was that it was
incredibly rare for someone who had one of
[SPEAKER_05]: these substances in their system for it to
be only marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: In overwhelming number of cases,
it was both alcohol and marijuana,
[SPEAKER_05]: and potentially other substances as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while people will always co-imbibed,
we don't think that it's responsible to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually facilitate that by allowing
products that contain both.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms. Caballero.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Smith.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a significant amount of concern
around the issue of infusion into products
[SPEAKER_04]: that children would perceive as things
they eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And will you have the ability to really,
and I'm thinking about the situations
[SPEAKER_04]: where, because with medical marijuana
right now, it's infused in anything and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's really no regulatory oversight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stepping back from that and changing
what they can be infused into has me
[SPEAKER_04]: concerned because I'm concerned that we
won't have the ability to be able to go
[SPEAKER_04]: into a retail facility, take out and test
and be able to determine whether they're
[SPEAKER_04]: living up to the requirements that are in
the regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: In particular, for those products that are
cooked or where their property has
[SPEAKER_04]: changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing the research to be able to
know whether the infusion, if it's put
[SPEAKER_04]: into a product, changes over time?
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be able to really know whether the
potency is such that it's consistent in
[SPEAKER_04]: the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have the resources to be
engaged in that research, although it is
[SPEAKER_05]: an active area of research.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a multi-state meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: A meeting of public health officials from
the states with legalized cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: happening in California right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was actually one of the
conversations we had yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Colorado's actively pursuing that as
well as others.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's an area that's really going
to develop over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are going to be proposing maximum
levels of THC in manufactured products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means we will be able to test
those products after manufacturing to
[SPEAKER_05]: ensure that they don't exceed that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also addressing the issue of
children from several other ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: The products cannot look substantially
like a food product that children
[SPEAKER_05]: recognize.
[SPEAKER_05]: The packaging cannot use bold colors,
cartoons, etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as it being opaque.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it is a product that does resemble a
food product that is commonly in use,
[SPEAKER_05]: the package has to be opaque.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be tamper, child resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in addition, if it has more than one
serving in it, it has to be resealable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're building in some pretty,
we hope, strenuous regulations without
[SPEAKER_05]: making it impossible to actually make
manufactured products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know those are some of the concerns to
make sure that this doesn't get in the
[SPEAKER_09]: hands of children.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to make sure that that's
paramount.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me just ask something real quick
before we move to Mathis that relates.
[SPEAKER_09]: So earlier you mentioned some of the
science and the research.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that science?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that research?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just elaborate a little bit more
on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: On that specific issue of how potency
changes?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that essentially what they're
doing is in research laboratories,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're actually taking various
manufactured products currently for sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's everything from really basic
science research looking at the changes in
[SPEAKER_05]: the molecular concentrations and the
flavor profiles all the way through to
[SPEAKER_05]: testing the product on humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not truly human testing, but
volunteers who imbibe the product who can
[SPEAKER_05]: provide subjective information to inform
it as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so is that the same, because earlier
you said there was research to not allow
[SPEAKER_09]: scientific research for the infusion in
alcohol and spirits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was speaking to one as overall we
know that when you take two central
[SPEAKER_05]: nervous system depressants and you add
them together, and that would be,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's true of opioid products,
for example, and alcohol and many other
[SPEAKER_05]: types of drugs and dietary supplements,
that you can get a potentiating effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, that's stronger
synergistic rather than just additive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I was saying, there's emerging
evidence to demonstrate that that may in
[SPEAKER_05]: fact be true.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is also true for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you for the clarification.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Mathis, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Smith, as you're talking and you're
talking about the science and all of that,
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we get into discussing CBD oil and
the percentages of THC within.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of that from some of the science
that I've been going through and folks
[SPEAKER_10]: that I've been talking to, talks about,
I mean, you literally get into a molecular
[SPEAKER_10]: level of how the plant's grown,
what it's grown with, and trace amounts of
[SPEAKER_10]: different things being into that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So is your department looking into those
things as part of the standards?
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, as far as moving product in from
other states, ensuring that the products
[SPEAKER_10]: that are coming in as well meet the same
standards that we're putting on the
[SPEAKER_10]: products here in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this gets more into also like with the
medical side.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you're saying three ounces of
THC oil is going to be this much,
[SPEAKER_10]: is it really?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it kind of gets into the purification
standards and issues of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just interested in where you guys
are at.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where you're at with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the science is really limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rapidly evolving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a distinction between THC,
which is the psychoactive part,
[SPEAKER_05]: and other cannabinoids, in particular CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the ones that most people
believe have the medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get profiles, and people do
this actually, of every single,
[SPEAKER_05]: there are many, and terpenes, which
provide flavor and apparently some level
[SPEAKER_05]: of the kind of high.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the language that people use.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell this isn't terribly
scientific at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are taking an approach based on safety
as opposed to efficacy as if it were a
[SPEAKER_05]: drug that we knew about potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're saying is that there can
only be this much, a maximum concentration
[SPEAKER_05]: of THC because that's the more
psychoactive substance, the one that
[SPEAKER_05]: creates the impairment that is a safety
issue in a serving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's very simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy to verify.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can test for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that over time, as the science
develops, there will be much more
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for what we know now, that's the way
that we have landed on as being the safest
[SPEAKER_05]: way to regulate how much of the
psychoactive substance people are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be ingesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Daly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick, I don't know if this is for
the Department of Agriculture or for your
[SPEAKER_07]: office, but so I'm a farmer regulated
heavily by the Department of Food and Ag.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a seed farmer, so I raise seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the chemicals I use in the process of
my seed is all reported to the Department
[SPEAKER_07]: of Ag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the consumer knows what's been
applied to the products that I sell when
[SPEAKER_07]: it's ingested for human use too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So who's going to know what the growers
out there are putting on the plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: And where does that regulation come in at?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we'll segue into Mr. Houston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Daly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Department of Pesticide Regulation
will retain their authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've issued guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit tricky because there's
no federally registered pesticides for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've done a lot of work on issuing
guidelines for cannabis growers as to what
[SPEAKER_02]: substances can be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those will continue to be reported to
the county ag commissioner and utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: that process to keep track of what
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the testing protocol as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the distributors have to drop it
off at a lab, statistically significant
[SPEAKER_02]: sample size like we do in our produce
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all produce is tested for pesticide
residue to make sure that it's in
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance with the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all cannabis product will be likewise
tested to make sure it's in compliance
[SPEAKER_02]: with the laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the agriculturist that's out there
raising the crop is going to be permitted
[SPEAKER_07]: and then is going to be required to also
let the county ag commissioners know what
[SPEAKER_07]: they're applying and when they're applying
it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Could I just ask, just to clarify for the
record though, what is current practice in
[SPEAKER_09]: terms of cultivation sites for acreage?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you mean what is the- When I go back
home, I talk to the city managers and
[SPEAKER_09]: supervisors and they're all worried about
mass cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the limit right now is 22,000 square
feet, which is about a half acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be the maximum size and
that is a level five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which comes into effect in 2022.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be large scale grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will come into effect then,
but there's two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's both the statutory sort of
licensing restrictions, but also our SQL
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis will shed some light on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can foresee that there will be,
as you get bigger and bigger and you
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize more and more resources,
the mitigation burden on that entity grows
[SPEAKER_02]: likewise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's going to factor into how
large the grows do get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is something we're also likewise
very concerned about to make sure that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's why the drafters of
Prop 64 put in the five year delay.
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding is the intent was to
allow for small growers to get a foothold
[SPEAKER_02]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we've seen, both in the
agricultural field, but we'll see it in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going to be hard for small
growers to- Got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is CDFA doing to help bring people
into compliance?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we keep hearing of illegal
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as I said before, sort of my mantra,
we really need to focus on having a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable and as simple as possible
regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very mindful of the small grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I talked about in the Senate hearing
and Mr. Wood, when I went up to Redway,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was very illuminating to see the
diversity of farmers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: participating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing that I really worry
about, I mean, the larger folks,
[SPEAKER_02]: the greenhouse folks, the well-heeled
capitalists, for lack of a better term,
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to probably be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the small fruit and veg grower
who's got a half acre of cannabis or an
[SPEAKER_02]: acre of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they going to do now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And however simple we can make our
registration process, the cost associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with that life, the license, we're all on
borrowed money right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the expectation is it's going to be
paid back through the cannabis program,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're very mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so trying to limit costs, trying to
limit registration fees and education and
[SPEAKER_02]: outreach to those growers, utilizing both
the sort of NGO community, legislators
[SPEAKER_02]: such as yourselves and your outreach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also doing our own outreach as much as
possible, utilizing ag commissioners to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out there to assist folks with their
compliance obligations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, keep the fees down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more people we can have in
there, the easier it's going to be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: flip side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the flip side is both going to be
complaint driven primarily, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: something we can do on our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: The California Highway Patrol,
federal drug enforcement agencies,
[SPEAKER_02]: local law enforcement all need to be
involved when we're talking about illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all going to depend on the
skies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The size and sophistication of those
operations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Mr. Wood and Mr. Daly have
additional questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Wood, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you also for your availability and
willing to reach out and work with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think as someone who's worked on this
issue, just in general, Ms. Ajax,
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody has been very accessible and we
really, really appreciate that and done a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot to help us along the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question goes back to, you talked about
2022 and the potential for these type five
[SPEAKER_08]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a fair characteristic that if
someone could meet CEQA and there was
[SPEAKER_08]: plenty of resources that we could have
conceivably an unlimited grow size?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really, really large grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's some theoretician that
will prove that there is some actual limit
[SPEAKER_02]: to there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, theoretically, yeah,
and I think that's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not a conversation that we're
just having with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a conversation that we're
having with sister agencies, with
[SPEAKER_02]: yourselves, with stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think everybody, the one nice
thing about this for the most part is
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's rowing in the same direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all want a successful regulatory
program come January 1, 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want those who want to participate to
be able to, and we want those who don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to participate to be able to stay
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having a marketplace that allows for
growers to have access to not have
[SPEAKER_02]: imbalances of power between the different
entities, between distributors and
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, manufacturers and distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've seen a rich history in this
country of how these things play out and
[SPEAKER_02]: how these imbalances ultimately almost
always impact the consumer, the person on
[SPEAKER_02]: the low end, the farmer, the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to have a conversation to
get ahead of that, to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: fairness, I guess, sort of rules the day
that you have an equal marketplace and
[SPEAKER_02]: that folks are allowed to compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I think we need them
to do, is to compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so that's a conversation we'll
continue to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, theoretically, that could happen,
but I don't think it's likely.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Dahle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I represent nine counties.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the same boat as Assemblymember
Wood, where my counties are, it's the Wild
[SPEAKER_07]: West, all right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so counties are looking at it as a
revenue source.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some have tried some things they
didn't like and changed those rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all my county's doing something
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: So very difficult for the growers,
for the processors, for locals who have
[SPEAKER_07]: been there abiding by rules and rules are
changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is your role?
[SPEAKER_07]: Coordinating with the counties,
I guess, because let me just give you an
[SPEAKER_07]: example.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shasta County had, and pretty much do what
you want for a while until they realized
[SPEAKER_07]: there was a lot of conflicts with
neighbors and with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they banned, they said no more outdoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the county I live in, Lassen,
had really restricted it, and then they
[SPEAKER_07]: decided to open it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically what happened was,
last year, around my farm, right,
[SPEAKER_07]: where we live, people are buying up land
like crazy and putting in all these grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is really the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, my wife is afraid to even drive to
our farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is your role with, is there
something that's going to be put out so
[SPEAKER_07]: that says, hey counties, this is going to
be the process that, this is the chain
[SPEAKER_07]: from grower to processor to consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be the statewide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to some extent, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the reasons why
we've been coordinating with our sister
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies to make sure that the regulations
unfold sort of commensurate with one
[SPEAKER_02]: another so that folks are able to get a
complete picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we are restricted to some degree
at the local level because it's up to
[SPEAKER_02]: those locals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our challenge is how do we stay
coordinated with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of probably the most important
thing that we want to accomplish is to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Order to that chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why this was all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we certainly want to accomplish that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as this gets going,
that is going to be one of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: is successful is folks are going to see
the regulatory environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be able to participate in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be able to have feedback,
etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a period of adaptation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure things are going to be
unanticipated and there's going to need to
[SPEAKER_02]: be some changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as folks are participating and
feel confident about it, that is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: With respect to what's happening sort of
at the local level with speculation and
[SPEAKER_02]: what not, there's going to be a settling
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are going to be people who
bet wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not something that we can
really control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to work closely with the
counties and our primary contact is
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously the county ag commissioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot of advantages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both their responsibility and
understanding of their county boards of
[SPEAKER_02]: supervisors, but also their connection to
the growing community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know more than anybody else what's
happening at the county level and what the
[SPEAKER_02]: wishes of the county board of supervisors
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is sort of where we are being
deferential to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your case where you've got a county
that doesn't want to do anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're hands off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We step in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there may be cities within that county
that want to participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's certainly what you see in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the county board of supervisors
tells the county ag commissioner,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, don't touch this at all, then we will
step in and we will do the licensing and
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement at the local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the extent that the county ag
commissioner is allowed to regulate the
[SPEAKER_02]: local municipalities, whether it be the
county or the city, we form cooperative
[SPEAKER_02]: agreements, much like we do in our C
program and others, where they'll carry
[SPEAKER_02]: out the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of how we're trying to
attack that and to bring some certainty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But feedback and communication is really
important.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if may I just one word on manufactured
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: While the local jurisdiction would decide
whether or not they want to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturing plant of some sort in their
jurisdiction, the regulation rests
[SPEAKER_05]: entirely with the department.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't set local manufacturing
regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's allowed to be sold in a dispensary,
what's allowed to be made falls under the
[SPEAKER_05]: department's purview.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's similar to food in that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no wild, wild west as far as
manufactured products or edibles,
[SPEAKER_05]: that sort of thing, or at least not.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we do this right and we can move people
out of the black market, there will be
[SPEAKER_05]: single regulatory structure for the state
as far as manufactured products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I should clarify, our
regulations as well set the floor for
[SPEAKER_02]: locals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no locals can go sort of below what our
license requirements are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can exceed them, they can further
restrict, but they can't say, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can have a 30,000 square foot license.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just an observation from where I come
from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the county government for 16
years, totally understand, and I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: regulated by the Department of Food and Ag
in my own business.
[SPEAKER_07]: The agriculture community that has been
growing crops to feed the world
[SPEAKER_07]: understands the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we've had is those who are coming in
don't understand the process of how we
[SPEAKER_07]: get, I totally understand where you're
trying to go and how you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right, at some point we'll have
mega farms out there and we'll destroy all
[SPEAKER_07]: these little guys that are trying to,
that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put each other out of business all day
long in the agriculture community.
[SPEAKER_07]: We over produce.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will eventually level out and then the
price will come down and it won't be the
[SPEAKER_07]: wild west.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will level out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need to try to figure out a way
that we can capture that revenue for the
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of consequences that come
with bringing this into the regulated
[SPEAKER_07]: market that we don't even know yet,
talking about driving impaired and all
[SPEAKER_07]: those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there needs to be a revenue that comes
with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we came out of prohibition,
it was set up a little better,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We basically said, hey, you're going to go
buy it from this store and they have a
[SPEAKER_07]: license.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to do alcohol, you have to
get a license.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to, it's controlled.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you weren't at that license,
you got a penalty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, as you all know, the way it
came through with the propositions is
[SPEAKER_07]: there's no place to really, we're trying
to force ourselves into that because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: been set up wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think all of what you're doing,
and I think most of the members here are
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to get to that point where we
actually capture that revenue and we
[SPEAKER_07]: actually get it into controlled buyers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the consumer at the end knows exactly
what, when they buy my seed, they know
[SPEAKER_07]: what's in the bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we need to know when we
sell this stuff that the consumer on the
[SPEAKER_07]: other end goes, okay, this is what I'm
getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the potency.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it been sprayed with?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's safeguards in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate what you're doing and I
thank you for taking the time to come down
[SPEAKER_07]: today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms. Ajax, I know there's several questions
here for you, but let's just ask the first
[SPEAKER_09]: threshold question, is will we be ready in
January?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I like that we could just make
that clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: To further expand, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The level of coordination- January 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been the level of coordination
between the other two departments and all
[SPEAKER_03]: the state agencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are committed to making sure that this
is off the ground and we're accepting
[SPEAKER_03]: applications on January 1st, 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where we can issue some licenses on
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made it very clear, not everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't issue everybody a license,
obviously, on January 1st, 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we recognize there's going to be some
transitional periods that we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have to make some decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we license a dispensary, what do we
do with the product that's currently in
[SPEAKER_03]: the dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it won't be tested and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't be in track and trace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are some transitional issues that
I think we'll work through over the first
[SPEAKER_03]: year and then probably be working with you
to make some tweaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or making tweaks to our regulations as
that occurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we're got a couple of spot bills
and a lot of members that are interested.
[SPEAKER_09]: But can you talk a little bit,
because you talked about it in your
[SPEAKER_09]: testimony, the emergency regulations,
how that's going to work out.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long you anticipate those to be as we
start transitioning into the whole full
[SPEAKER_09]: regulatory body work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so at least for the medical side,
we're going to go through the full rule
[SPEAKER_03]: making process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to, like we said,
we're going to notice them early spring
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's going to kick off our 45 day
comment period.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have our hearings across
the state, get feedback, and then respond
[SPEAKER_03]: to that feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe even have to go out for another
comment period.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think a lot of what's in the medical,
a lot of it's similar to what's in
[SPEAKER_03]: Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: The feedback we get from that,
that's going to help us with those
[SPEAKER_03]: emergency regulations for Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also any legislative changes,
we will then do that through the emergency
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we plan to, I think we're all looking
at August, September.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we have a clear what the legislature
is going to do, then we're going to work
[SPEAKER_03]: on probably noticing those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe the statute gives us like
180 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still going to go through the
comment period, it'll just be after the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: The emergency regulations will take place
effective immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there's a time period there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it, but you have a game plan in place
and you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have a game plan and we have to
change that game plan frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always reassessing our timeline
constantly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have additional questions,
but I know members are anxious to ask you
[SPEAKER_09]: plenty of questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's start with Mr. Cooley and then
we'll move to Mr. John Sawyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really two questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: For all the attendees, I thank you very
much for being here, this is very much the
[SPEAKER_06]: basic idea behind 266 was to have a lead
agency partnering with other agencies to
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure we cover the whole waterfront,
but take advantage of your expertise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm delighted to just kind of see how
it's unfolding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mentioned the characterization,
just generally not warranting the level of
[SPEAKER_06]: this, but how are you staffed up at this
stage for where you think you're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: end up being?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I sort of feel like Ms. Ajax,
you have a different challenge than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the established agencies were sort of
tapping into their existing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd be interested in getting a quick
characterization from folks on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to hear a little bit about
the advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always felt the advisory committee was a
very important transitional body because
[SPEAKER_06]: the original prop from 1996 dealt with
affordable access.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going into a different market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a place where issues of
access were going to be able to be
[SPEAKER_06]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it became a way to let low and
moderate income Californians, people
[SPEAKER_06]: dependent upon the old system,
to have their voice in the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so a characterization of staffing
levels just generally across the three
[SPEAKER_06]: agencies in the advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start with, for the bureau,
we have a 15 position that we were,
[SPEAKER_03]: through the BCP process, that were
authorized.
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently have six vacancies,
but we've also utilized a lot of temporary
[SPEAKER_03]: help.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some limited term attorneys on
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have to do a CEQA initial study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're partnering up with Water
Resources, with an MOU with them to help
[SPEAKER_03]: us with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have an MOU with the Department of
Public Health to assist us with the
[SPEAKER_03]: testing lab regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a couple of retired annuitant
and a couple student assistants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where our vacancies are, we've helped
staff up with some temporary help.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have the Department of Consumer
Affairs that helps us with a lot of our
[SPEAKER_03]: administrative tasks with budgets and
helping us with human resources issues and
[SPEAKER_03]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they've been supplementing us and
helping us for our staffing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great overview.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Department of Food and
Agriculture, we've hired 22 people so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of how that relates to the
scale, budget proposal, proposes to hire
[SPEAKER_02]: some more 60 people next year in
anticipation, because you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: January 1 is the middle of the budget
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're at full scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be in excess of 150
employees for the division.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't provide you with exact numbers,
but we're staffed for the development of
[SPEAKER_05]: the regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we've done is also submit for
additional positions in the BCP in order
[SPEAKER_05]: to help us establish training for people
who want to do manufacturing and want to
[SPEAKER_05]: become licensees, but then also to
establish five, at this point we're
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking five offices throughout the state
of California so there's ready access in
[SPEAKER_05]: all the different areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to require additional
staff as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the advisory committee question,
so under the Medical Canvas Regulation and
[SPEAKER_03]: Safety Act, there wasn't required,
it was a may.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our approach was to really do a
robust public outreach.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first, because a lot of our staff,
including myself, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: learning we had to do to learn about the
industry, how they operate, hear about all
[SPEAKER_03]: the concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used that approach under the medical
instead of the advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: But under Proposition 64, it is required
and we are working on putting out the
[SPEAKER_03]: process for selecting those committee
members.
[SPEAKER_03]: because we really think that's going to be
very helpful when we do the adult use
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward and we really want that
input.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, we need that input.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just ask, when do you anticipate
that first advisory committee coming
[SPEAKER_09]: together for a meeting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first we're going to have an
application process and then make the
[SPEAKER_03]: selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a priority right now for the bureau
and so I expect that to happen very soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so selection process will conclude
when?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have an anticipated date now or
not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we expect to have the application
process be able to announce that probably
[SPEAKER_03]: within the next week or so with a 30 day
period for people to apply and then make
[SPEAKER_03]: selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would anticipate a first meeting
being at least several months down the
[SPEAKER_03]: road.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Mr. Cooley had a follow up
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was more going to make a follow up,
just an observation.
[SPEAKER_06]: My recollection is through most the life
of this discussion, the advisory committee
[SPEAKER_06]: was a shall.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end, it probably was switched to a
may.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the issues it covered and the
foothold it gave certain people to kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: be inside the conversation and by statute
sort of affirmed that their viewpoint on
[SPEAKER_06]: those issues was important.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably an important piece of kind
of how it moves forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do understand as a lawyer that it's
between shall and may, but I think for the
[SPEAKER_06]: chemistry of how we sort of advance a
conversation, I definitely think that,
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly on the issue of access,
that's a very important body to constitute
[SPEAKER_06]: and it gives you a way to give some people
a seat at the table that might otherwise
[SPEAKER_06]: feel sort of not included.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's becomes, it may be a may,
but it may be a very useful management
[SPEAKER_06]: tool for the conversation, so observation
on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Rules Chair.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go ahead and move to Mr. Reginald
Byron Jones Sawyer Sr. Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of, and it might be for all,
maybe just Ms. Ajax only because you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been singled out more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason why AB 266 was
successful after years and years of people
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to basically get regulations in,
I think it's because we had several joint
[SPEAKER_01]: authors between Mr. Bonta Cooley,
John Sawyer Lackey, and Mr. Wood,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we affectionately call ourselves the
Fabulous Five.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to get something done that
nobody else had been able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think because we were inclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were a broad spectrum of mob
aggressive, we were a broad spectrum of
[SPEAKER_01]: different geographic areas, and I think
most important, we also were bipartisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that really, really helped in
us moving to where we are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, if we hadn't put in
the regulations now, Prop 64 passes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would be starting from scratch,
scratch, scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was the input of everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from a predominantly Latino African
American community, poor, I'm very
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned that we may or may not have an
opportunity to be at the table,
[SPEAKER_01]: may or not have an opportunity to have
input.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am concerned that we look up one day,
we get all this done, and the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are in business are white males
with a lot of money, or corporations,
[SPEAKER_01]: as my colleague talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't afford the opportunity of
people of color to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this, in any substantive ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not talking about selling to us,
because we are great consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do we have an opportunity to
participate?
[SPEAKER_01]: The second part of that is the impacts
that it can have on our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when we went down this road of
having liquor stores, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably in more affluent areas,
they probably became liquor store
[SPEAKER_01]: boutiques where they sold fine wines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were unbelievable detriment to
disadvantaged communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at the onset, nobody ever
really could perceive that it would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of that is because no one
included people from disadvantaged
[SPEAKER_01]: communities, Latino, African American,
in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my district, I'm not certain if you
reached out or had any hearings in my
[SPEAKER_01]: district, the 59th Assembly District,
which is South Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can show me that, that would be
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more important, if the outreach has
not been as successful, because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, is there ways that we can make it
even more successful in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going from a positive point of view,
if it's whatever we can do to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you get full, full input.
[SPEAKER_01]: From these disadvantaged communities,
we need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially as we move from medical
marijuana to full plus adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's my responsibility,
not only as an assemblyman, but to look
[SPEAKER_01]: out for the impacts it will have on
disadvantaged communities and try to see
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of waiting for it to drop on us,
disadvantage our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to be back here trying to
figure out how to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great opportunity now to have
those discussions and not wait until
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hearing about hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing about an advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, we're looking at making sure
it's inclusive of everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you don't become an advisory board,
as I like to say, is the whitest white
[SPEAKER_01]: board you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do include people of color in
these discussions and make sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess most important, that they're
heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any comment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or all of a sudden I heard crickets again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bureau, and I think all of us are
committed to making sure we hear from
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think from day one, that's what we
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to get input from everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just certain folks, but to be
inclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's always room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to working with your
office.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were in the LA area, but downtown,
where people could hopefully get to
[SPEAKER_03]: easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the more outreach we do,
the better our regulations are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, and the better informed we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also working with the locals, we've worked
a lot with the local cities and counties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there is local control,
they've been dealing with this a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot longer than the state, and so
learning from them on their affected
[SPEAKER_03]: communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some really good robust cities
and counties out there that have cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations and learning from them and
moving forward with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am committed to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other thing is our application
process, making people understand the
[SPEAKER_03]: application process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we notice our regulation doing that
outreach and telling people about the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity and what they need to have in
hand on day one when they want to apply
[SPEAKER_03]: with the bureau or one of the other
departments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And explaining that process and getting
out to the communities so that they are
[SPEAKER_03]: empowered to go seek a license and not
have to hire a lawyer or a consultant to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that also comes into play with
our regulations and making them simple and
[SPEAKER_03]: comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we're committed to
going forward, and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_03]: working with your office.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like the message has been
received, and it's a good segue into our
[SPEAKER_09]: next panel, too, to see how that's
actually working on the local level.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just have two quick follow up
questions for you, but say, Jackson,
[SPEAKER_09]: then we'll go ahead and move on unless
members have additional questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you touched upon us making sure we
have all the licenses ready for 2018.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a priority?
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we prioritizing that?
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we going to work through that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you expand on that just a
little bit, and then I have one more
[SPEAKER_09]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is priority licensing in both
medical and the adult use statutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to be looking at,
most of it is people who are currently in
[SPEAKER_03]: operation or good standing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be looking at that when
we prioritize who we license on starting
[SPEAKER_03]: in January of 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is also authority in the adult
use for us to issue temporary licenses.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you, and then maybe I should
ask this of all three of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: As Chairwoman Caballero, Chairman Mr.
Wood, and myself, there's a lot of bills
[SPEAKER_09]: being talked about and proposed and spot
bills that are currently before us or are
[SPEAKER_09]: going to come before us.
[SPEAKER_09]: But do you anticipate anything that we
should be focusing on?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we touched upon that a little bit
earlier where we need to do the entire
[SPEAKER_09]: fix, but something we should be looking at
specifically.
[SPEAKER_09]: As the chairs of these three committees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think we're having
discussions both internally and those
[SPEAKER_02]: folks are having conversations with
legislative representatives about sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: what those areas are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly at the Department of
Food and Ag, there's a difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: the two license types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the requirements under MACRSA and the
requirements under Prop 64 are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So reconciling those is something that's
our sort of part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think other entities have sort of
similar discrepancies, but I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's sort of a working group of folks
that are hammering those out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe I should ask the question a
little bit differently, because I know
[SPEAKER_09]: we're going to have the reconciliation
bill later on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But are there any specific legislative
needs just specifically for your
[SPEAKER_09]: department that are needed at this time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or we're just kind of going to work
through it and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's the latter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The latter, okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
