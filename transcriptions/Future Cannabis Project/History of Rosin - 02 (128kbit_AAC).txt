[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, greetings, greetings,
and welcome back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gather around.
[SPEAKER_09]: Part two of the history of rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, my name is Nick Ati.
[SPEAKER_09]: To my right, we have Phil of Soil Grown
Solvent List.
[SPEAKER_09]: And over here further to the right,
I'm introducing you guys to Ben,
[SPEAKER_09]: AKA Show Me Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Show me the Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: These Instagram names are hard to
remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Ben McCabe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Show me the Terps of Rosin Tech and Rosin
Tech Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell them a little bit about what you
do at Rosin Tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we work for, Rosin Tech is one of our
affiliates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I work for Show Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a distribution and manufacturing
license in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under our manufacturing license,
which I directly oversee, is Rosin Tech
[SPEAKER_04]: Labs, where we produce high-end live
rosins, ice water hashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our main brands is Rosin Tech Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Nick mentions Rosin Tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosin Tech Products, which produces rosin
presses for everything from the home user
[SPEAKER_04]: to large-scale manufacturing, was a
company that we started with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just through evolution through the
cannabis industry, we were finally able to
[SPEAKER_04]: get our California license to start
putting out product online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And onto the legal market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I head up the manufacturing and other
aspects of Show Labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have watched him do all the
demonstrations since day one with Rosin
[SPEAKER_09]: Tech Products, doing live pressing
demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's beautiful to see where they've
come today and see this guy making moves
[SPEAKER_09]: in the licensed world in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big up yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the way from Barcelona,
Spain, in Barcelona, Spain, over here to
[SPEAKER_09]: my left, we have my longtime brethren,
Edu.
[SPEAKER_09]: Edu is a Blue Ice Tech.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Blue Ice Tech California is working
out of Cookies Maywood.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Edu, what are you doing over there at
Cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Nick was telling you, I'm working
at Cookies right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to figure out what we can do
there, because they don't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: non-solvent lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: They was doing just some solvent extracts,
but not non-solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had tons of trim sitting there on
the floor, just trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they realized that the solvent
market is going down, they thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: they have to do something with
non-solvent, with all this trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they called me to help them a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they brought out the big guns.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is Edu, Blue Ice Tech.
[SPEAKER_09]: This man's been around for a long time,
winning multiple cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, last year, he judged Spanibus in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_09]: This man has been making hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is his passion.
[SPEAKER_09]: And big up, Edu, for coming all the way
out from Barcelona, Spain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for every time, for real.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted each of these gentlemen on
stage to kind of talk about what rosin
[SPEAKER_09]: means to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they first learned about the term
rosin, when you first started pressing
[SPEAKER_09]: rosin, some of the difficulties you
encountered, what you learned and how you
[SPEAKER_09]: learned it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start with Ben over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: When did you first hear about rosin?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I grew up on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a East Coast guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I might be the youngest person
on the panel here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might be kind of like new school to
the solventless world in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis years are like dog years,
so like seven years in one, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was making BHO just like everybody
else on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had sent a photo to my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some really nice kind of like yellow
shatter that we had made, which was kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of the in thing at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had texted me a question back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent him this photo that was this
beautiful yellow slab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, oh, is that rosin?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the fuck is rosin?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you mean resin?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: And from there, we obviously started to
have that discussion is where I actually
[SPEAKER_04]: started to hear about Nick and started to
dive deep into all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we didn't have to use butane on
my mother's back porch.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can use just heat presses and ice water
hash to get that full melt level and to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually have it be far superior than
butane, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be up here on the panel is actually,
I mean, really exciting to come that way
[SPEAKER_04]: from, I mean, it seems like yesterday,
but I want to say it was like five years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago or so when you guys were starting to
blow up with putting rosin onto different
[SPEAKER_04]: social medias and YouTubes and different
forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find like little really like
threads of information that if you knew
[SPEAKER_04]: like resin and knew making extracts,
you know, things would start to pop like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh shit, a hair straightener, you know,
like there was I mean, the amount of hair
[SPEAKER_04]: straighteners we went through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of this started with oral tradition.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of this started with just trying it
for yourself, you know, the hair
[SPEAKER_09]: straightener tech, you know, and I like to
bring it back to Mila Jansen, the hash
[SPEAKER_09]: queen from Pollinator.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I first started learning from Mila
back in the early 2000, there was nothing
[SPEAKER_09]: written about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a few forum posts in 2001 and
really it was about oral tradition.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about going to these hash makers
and talking to them about their
[SPEAKER_09]: experiences in Morocco and their
experiences in Europe and their
[SPEAKER_09]: experiences in India and really just
hearing what they had to say that pushed
[SPEAKER_09]: me to want to learn further.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's still what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with like jar tech right now,
it's like a simple thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You throw it in the jar tech, but like if
you're a hash guy with solvent lists,
[SPEAKER_04]: like where you say we're trying to come
back with like these butane guys making
[SPEAKER_04]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just float into a jar and seal it for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a relatively simple advancement,
but it's like fascinating and really not
[SPEAKER_04]: that simple if you think about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you mentioned, you know, blasting
butane tubes on your backyard.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all started there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like, you know, to be completely
honest, I did too, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guilty for the love of hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: 2003, 2004, I bought a honeybee extractor
off the back of a high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those little plastic ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard it was the best butane out there
and I definitely blasted butane on the
[SPEAKER_09]: back porch of my house in Boulder,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm putting it out there, you know,
but we all started somewhere because it
[SPEAKER_09]: taught me so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was plastic, a polymer of some sort.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, honeybee extractor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm giving them credit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back at high times magazine, 2003,
2004.
[SPEAKER_09]: But either way, you know, that's what
pushed me to want to do something else.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually made that honey oil on the back
of my porch and I started giving it to all
[SPEAKER_09]: my friends and my friends were getting
goofy, like a little too fucked up,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, wait, what's in this?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I started actually trotting to Europe
and I made trips to Amsterdam to learn
[SPEAKER_09]: from Mila.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, one of the first cafes that gave
me any information as to what was that
[SPEAKER_09]: product was the Bluebird Cafe because back
then in 2004, 2005 is when they started
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of seeing this butane product or this
honey oil hit the market and started
[SPEAKER_09]: banning it in places.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there were not a lot of people talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was not a lot of research done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bluebird Cafe was one of the only places
that had soy milk too, believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you find these heady little spots and
these people were willing to talk about it
[SPEAKER_09]: and there was a scientist there that was
doing some testing and he was finding a
[SPEAKER_09]: ton of heavy metals in their honey oil
that was on the shelf being sold.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people found ways around that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They started mixing the honey oil with
their bubble hash, you know, and calling
[SPEAKER_09]: it jelly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anybody remembers jelly
from mid 2000s, early 2000s, but there
[SPEAKER_09]: were ways that people started getting
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were saying that with Moroccan
hash, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moroccan hash with VHL, so that was
creepy.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we started learning that the butane at
that point there was not enough education.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was not enough knowledge.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were heavy metals that we were
putting into the product.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were concentrating those heavy metals
and that's what pushed me to try and
[SPEAKER_09]: recreate that color and that consistency
without the use of chemical solvents,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is value to what we were doing on
the back porch because we were all there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just wanted to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where that tangent came from.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pick up yourself then.
[SPEAKER_09]: That hash is good, yo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually used the hottest commodity was
a stainless steel turkey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you cut a screen out of the back
porch like you talk about heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_04]: not even thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be holes out of my screen.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, we all came from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all actually just consumed some of this
gentleman's hash who flew all the way out
[SPEAKER_09]: here and is utilizing dry material.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all preach fresh frozen whole plant
material as we were mentioning and now the
[SPEAKER_09]: man's on stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted him to talk a little bit about
what he's doing in the lab specifically
[SPEAKER_09]: because we really have all preached this
whole plant fresh frozen since I learned
[SPEAKER_09]: from this gentleman named Joe Petrie.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually going to talk about that a
little bit further right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Joe Petrie kept yelling at me being
like, your hash isn't mine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're making it with butane.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were posting pictures on the forums at
this point getting kicked off of water
[SPEAKER_09]: hash forums because our water hash started
looking like butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was gold and gooey and people didn't
believe us to be completely honest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to the legends of hash in 2009.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I almost got kicked out.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And skunk man Sam's pulls me aside and
he's like, this isn't water hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not allowed in this contest.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is only for dry sift butane hash oil
and tries to kick me and Harold aka Bamf
[SPEAKER_09]: extractions out of legends of hashies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was a lot of like trials and
tribulations we faced with this new
[SPEAKER_09]: technology with controlling the variables
of the ice and the water and the input
[SPEAKER_09]: material utilizing fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to get back to Joseph Petrie,
he was like, you don't make real hash
[SPEAKER_09]: because he thought we were making butane
from our photos.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I make live hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Live hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at that point, I think I cut the guy
off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I'm done with this crazy kook
yelling at me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is before Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, but there's something to
his live hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a messed up run in 2010 around that
time when I was running a laboratory in a
[SPEAKER_09]: place called pink house blooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had our own garden on site.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at day 40, 45, we started noticing
some hermaphrodite plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these plants started throwing pistols
and throwing things that we didn't want to
[SPEAKER_09]: see that we didn't want to bring to
fruition as flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the boss was like, yeah,
just do what you want with that row.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a little early granted,
but it was alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: These plants were alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, oh, this kook guy put this
word live into my head.
[SPEAKER_09]: These plants are live.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I literally took these plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a few big leaves off of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I chopped them at the root.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I grabbed the base of these plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I put them in my cold water bucket and
just started spinning with my buddy
[SPEAKER_09]: Stephen Lewis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just two of us for like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we took the whole row down.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're throwing this shit away.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to just try this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this wasn't fresh frozen yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this was live plants as far as we were
concerned.
[SPEAKER_09]: Took them straight from the root and
started mixing them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the product that came from this was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It started really, really looking like
butane at that point.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really, really hard to handle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it became so hard to handle,
we were like, OK, wait, let's pull it back
[SPEAKER_09]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we handle these live plants?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really where fresh frozen came
from, or live resin in the butane world,
[SPEAKER_09]: live rosin in our world.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many different terms that we
like to touch on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's still a little time up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But fresh frozen became a commodity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Live, whole plant, fresh frozen for not
only the live resin guys utilizing butane,
[SPEAKER_09]: but for us, solvent.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to retain a lot more of the
terpenes present in the plant while it was
[SPEAKER_09]: growing by running it live.
[SPEAKER_09]: So pick up Joseph Pietri if you're
listening out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got love for a hater.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he's the one that flipped the
switch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's when I started teaching Europe
about processing live or fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_09]: product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like it's where Giddy Up and a lot
of them got that inspiration to run their
[SPEAKER_09]: fresh frozen material in their hydrocarbon
units, AKA live resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all family.
[SPEAKER_09]: It all happened around the same time in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Edu over here is doing magic.
[SPEAKER_09]: So without further ado, he is utilizing
dry material.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just rolled up a spliff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't even handle it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still on my hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to know how you're preserving
the terpenes and really what you've
[SPEAKER_09]: learned coming out here and experiencing
some of the strains that we're running
[SPEAKER_09]: compared to the strains you've ran in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give a little background about what you've
been doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, since all of you know, I'm from Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for my bad English.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's English.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Spain, we smoke hash for long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think since 726 years, when the Arabs
came to Spain, they came with hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I think the word hashishin is
coming from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were smoking the hash before
they came to the war.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had swords too, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They were smoking hash before battle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hashishin.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where that term came from,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is his culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where we came from.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really what we've been mimicking
this entire time is this culture and this
[SPEAKER_09]: generation that came from this man's
hometown.
[SPEAKER_09]: So bring it back for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been smoking hash for long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the hash that we were smoking,
it was hash mostly from Morocco,
[SPEAKER_03]: from India, and from Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the quality of that hash, now we know
that it was low quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on that moment, it was the only type
of hash able to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought that the hash was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that time, we learned from them,
from the Moroccan people, that we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way we smoke in Spain is with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: We roll the hash with the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people in Spain, they used to use like
half a gram of hash in a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they smoked four or five joints a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two or three grams a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people buy hash at $5, $10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have these amazing products that
we can do, as you say, with fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_03]: whole plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't have that market in Spain
ready to pay $100 for a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that make us a little bit difficult to
improve and to grow as a hash maker doing
[SPEAKER_03]: top quality six star product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since the beginning, I've been doing
hash just with trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that trim was trim from plants dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that the quality is not like
when you use fresh frozen materials,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you have more turps on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because during the dry process,
you lose a lot of turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was enough good for us if we
compare with the Moroccan hash that we
[SPEAKER_03]: were smoking before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to do, as you say, magic with trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to explain to the growers that they
have to keep the trim fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to trim when the plant is fresh
and keep that trim on the freezer for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a little bit hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, at the beginning, people was
throwing away that trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was asking them for that trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was giving back money or hash to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they was really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they realize that I'm making money
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they charge me money for that trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a little bit hard for me to
do high quality product and be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell it at a fair price for me and for the
customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this has been an issue over
generations.
[SPEAKER_09]: In reality, as I was mentioning,
I started up in Mendo and Humboldt County,
[SPEAKER_09]: where I was collecting trim off the side
of the road.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was all dry trim that the farmers
didn't even want on their property,
[SPEAKER_09]: because that was just more weight that
they could possibly get in trouble for.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's crazy where the education has
come, where we started, where it was just
[SPEAKER_09]: garbage previously.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're turning it into gold.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, yeah, it's all about
education.
[SPEAKER_07]: One question I have for you is coming from
Spain, and paraphrase the question,
[SPEAKER_07]: but what are your first impressions of the
US slash LA scene?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then globally, what do you guys see in
scene one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so the question is, what are your
first impressions on the LA scene versus
[SPEAKER_09]: the global scene?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's interesting that you say that
it's harder for you guys to get $100 a
[SPEAKER_09]: gram.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually want to touch this real quick,
because in Colorado, when we first brought
[SPEAKER_09]: these solventless products to market,
I was stoked if I was getting $40 a gram.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the education and the slim amount of
amazingly protected and curated material
[SPEAKER_09]: has created an increase in demand in this
product, along with the regulation,
[SPEAKER_09]: the overregulation, and everything else
that comes with the licensing in
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to get back to the question,
what have you noticed here in LA or in the
[SPEAKER_09]: United States as the market compared to
the global market you experienced?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been coming to America a few times
during the last five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to came for the expos, like high
times, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that I'm here in LA, I feel like
it's a little bit like Barcelona in Spain,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we compare.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Spain, that we have all these
cannabis clubs, and all this cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: culture, and we have Barcelona,
that is like the center of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like LA is a little bit the center
of everything here in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of market here, and people
are ready to invest, and ready to spend
[SPEAKER_03]: money on that high quality products.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, especially here in the United
States, what we have seen is a lot of the
[SPEAKER_09]: hype, a lot of the education.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of these products start on the
coasts, whether we're talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: California, LA, San Francisco,
or New York.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether we're talking about style trends,
whether we're talking about trends in
[SPEAKER_09]: hashish, trends in food.
[SPEAKER_09]: Coastal trends are real, as far as what
I've experienced.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that $100 a gram, $120 a gram,
that's a very LA or California thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in Colorado, it seems to be much
cheaper than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do have a question, too,
as far as the European market.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing, I've traveled to Spannibus a
few times, and to Spain, and Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you said, is the epicenter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very much the LA of Spain,
in regards to weed, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of hype over California
strands.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the gelato, there's the cookies,
there's these newer flavors that have come
[SPEAKER_04]: out within the past 10 years that people
are getting excited about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even over in Europe, because
California now, with the legalities,
[SPEAKER_04]: is allowing people to do a lot of R&D.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you rarely in California see sativa
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of beautiful hazes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a haze lover at heart, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a lot of haze and sours,
which you really don't see anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: But haze, I mean, it's traditional hashish
making strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody does it anymore, partly because
of the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's your experience with washing
and pressing different types of hazes over
[SPEAKER_04]: there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you or do you strictly stick to is the
American strains, the California strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: the hype over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, in my case, maybe it's a little bit
particular, because since I love haze a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot, if my haze is clean, I like
everything, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like haze, I like sativas, I like
indigas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, in Spain, haze is really
popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been growing amnesia haze,
super silver haze, these all strains from
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam that I was really in love of
these special strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people don't like to grow that strange
with 128 days flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a rarity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the true turf lover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you only take them 50,
60 days, what are you yielding?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you yielding on them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativas don't yield that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't look really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real sativa, they don't do buds,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do like small stems, fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are a real connoisseur,
you have to like sativas, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: True, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I go to Spain, I'm waiting to
see some different hazes in live rosin or
[SPEAKER_04]: full melt form.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, every time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to break it to you guys,
but I think one of the reasons that you
[SPEAKER_09]: guys don't see a lot of it, I touched on
the yield.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when we're talking about yield in
water hash, let's bring it back to the
[SPEAKER_09]: history of rosin real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hazes have a thick, waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Generally speaking, super silver haze,
jack.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any of those strains, amnesia haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some of the other hazes that are
out there?
[SPEAKER_09]: The pith.
[SPEAKER_09]: Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a few.
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been a few outliers to this
rule.
[SPEAKER_09]: But most of these hazes that I'm seeing
have a very thick, waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even if you're gonna yield almost
enough to make it viable when you make
[SPEAKER_09]: water hash, when you go and then press
that water hash into rosin, he was talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about 91% yields.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're lucky if we see 40% yields on hazes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that, even if you get
a little something that might be high
[SPEAKER_09]: quality, that wax also attributes to
making darker colors, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to heat up the temperature higher
to actually extrude the oils through the
[SPEAKER_09]: wax.
[SPEAKER_09]: So less terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the color matter, though?
[SPEAKER_09]: Less terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Higher temperatures, less terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a lot of variables that
attribute to hazes being extremely
[SPEAKER_09]: unpopular to hash makers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel the high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand the haze high.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you break it down, it's very hard
to find a haze that's gonna be viable,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you sell it in flower form,
it's extremely viable.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you break it down and you're
seeing 1% to 5% yields after rosin,
[SPEAKER_09]: it just doesn't make it viable to send
into that allocated route.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mentioned allocations earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are some outliers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do want to bring up an outlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of my favorite hazes to run.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ghost train haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few phenotypes that do combine
the haze taste, but with that ghost power
[SPEAKER_09]: from the ghost OG and the train wreck to
help that trichome production.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been seeing things that are
viable.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're seeing 15, 20% yields, over 20%
yields.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're running one called the ghost
train haze number nine.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, pheno numbers at this point
are dictated by the growers themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't say, run the ghost train nine
and you're gonna do great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's got a different ghost train
number.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not number nine, but they have been able
to breed hazes that taste and that feeling
[SPEAKER_09]: into strains that are viable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are the things that I'd look
for.
[SPEAKER_09]: The pure hazes, the pure land-raised hazes
are gonna be very, very hard to come by in
[SPEAKER_09]: water hash form or rosin form because of
the structure of the trichome and it just
[SPEAKER_09]: not wanting to make water hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the plan is not worth it because if
you have to wait 128 or 130 days
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering, I mean, it's gonna be more
expensive than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow your own is what I say with that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need that haze, that 130 day haze
high, which I don't discount.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see that there's a lot of people that
need that high.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's gonna be really hard to find it
at a shop because it takes a lot of energy
[SPEAKER_09]: and a lot of dedication.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think you'll be seeing
strains like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of what we do focus on, let's bring
it back to, you know, the positive side of
[SPEAKER_09]: things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually want to hear everyone's theory
on this, is I've been really focused on
[SPEAKER_09]: strains that are yielding viable amounts
because it helps our cultivation see that
[SPEAKER_09]: it's worth it for them to give us that
flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: It helps our business model, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So first, I'm looking at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't want to be generalizing,
but I do look at a lot of the yield data.
[SPEAKER_09]: But oftentimes that yield data also
attributes to higher THCA, higher THC
[SPEAKER_09]: numbers in general, higher terpene amounts
because if you have a thinner wax eutical,
[SPEAKER_09]: you have higher terpenes generally,
which is a higher yield.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terpenes are heavier than waxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of things that we look at
that yield helps us attribute to.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really look at things like the yield
when we're talking about material,
[SPEAKER_09]: starting material to finish product,
rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at the potency, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the second one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the third one is I look at that
terpene representation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those are the three things that I
look for in doing my washes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it doesn't hit those three things,
it's not something that I generally want
[SPEAKER_09]: to wash.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in those three things, I want to have
very specific terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to have one that's got the
limonene.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to have one that has that gas,
the pineene.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want one that's really sugary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I have, you know, my five favorite
hash, water hash, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_09]: rosin strains, strains that do really well
in water hash and do really well in rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some of your guys' favorite
strains?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll touch on mine after.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your favorite strain to wash right
now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Your top two, Ben.
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast, I have to say AJ's Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That cut specifically is like from a fresh
frozen will yield like 6%, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful from fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But regardless of anything, like I
mentioned Hayes before, like I'm a terp
[SPEAKER_04]: seeker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care like really what it yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at the end of the day,
like we all got into it because it was for
[SPEAKER_04]: what we wanted to consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even like, you know, I was trying an A5
Hayes the other day, which is like a new
[SPEAKER_04]: one floating around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had the profile and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll give you three.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was AJ's.
[SPEAKER_04]: The A5 is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the peanut butter cup that's been
going around has got this gassiness to it
[SPEAKER_04]: that I love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yields well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the terp, I mean, terps are
number one for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you go, the terps are third for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps are number one by far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes it hard to do business, but.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wholeheartedly love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: But how many times are you going to get
more material from that grower?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when he sees, you know,
if you're doing a trade, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: it all depends on how you're working.
[SPEAKER_09]: But say you're spending a certain amount
of money on a pound of material,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and you're getting from that
same farm, you're getting one strain that
[SPEAKER_09]: yields that 6%, that AJ.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that one strain that yields less
than 1%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rarity for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every now and then, you'll like run
something that yields you nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the end result is fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll never, ever wash it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think all of us Hashmakers want that
for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, how often does it continue to
come back?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's two sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: From personally to like a business
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure, yields always a question.
But.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to grow it yourself at that point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the farmer's not going to keep
giving you that strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your boss isn't going to keep letting you
run that strain, but he loses them money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, I think as the market
develops, maybe they will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, price will start
to be dictated on the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it takes you 120 days for some hazes to
grow, that flower should be priced more,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as the market develops,
those things might come to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we might be able to see those things.
Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_09]: Phil, what are some of your favorite hash
strains or rosin strains?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my favorite hash strains, stuff I like
to wash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely got to hand it to Strawberry
Banana.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like my go-to for R&D as far as
like a very stable strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really consistent with a lot of
things that I do and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: experimenting I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like it's really good for everything
as far as jar tech, jams, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: making wet batters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the second press method, solventless
or mechanical separation, like making the
[SPEAKER_06]: press method with the R&D.
So I definitely got to hand it to
Strawberry Banana.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very high in THCA.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very high in THCA with the great
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely got to hand it to Strawberry
Banana.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, one I fell in love with was
cement shoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just, to me, I think it's just
the terpene profile that gets me,
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as the just the effects from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, number one for me as well,
I'd have to agree with Ben, is the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's number one on my list, and then next
is everything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm going to do a dab after a dab
after a dab anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, it's going to do its job.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that terpene profile really,
really got me.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the cross on the cement shoes?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's bred by Colt Classic Seeds,
correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not 100% on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then what's the profile?
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, the profile is like a really gassy,
funky, savory almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I like it so much, because it
really isn't comparable to what's popular
[SPEAKER_06]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not GMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not papaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Strawberry Banana.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's none of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just gassy, but it's super
unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one thing that I really love
about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about one of my strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it does touch on some of what you guys
just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of my favorite terpene profiles
for a long time has been the lemon rind
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the outside of a lemon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not super lemon haze, which has more of
like a lemon orange cleaner type of a
[SPEAKER_09]: smell to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit more round and fruity.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wanted like the rind of a lemon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to me, what epitomized the rind of a
lemon was the strain called Lemon G
[SPEAKER_09]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a clone only.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really hard to get.
[SPEAKER_09]: It grew like shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It grew those fingers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you got it under a little bit
too hot of light.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really you only wanted to grow it
under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned eventually.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that thing foxtail like crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: The flowers weren't good.
[SPEAKER_09]: My hash concentrates yielded less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I turned a whole garden into
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I might have pulled like 30 grams from
my head and like lost maybe $15,000.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I love terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But I started then looking towards that
lemon rind terpene.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that strain called Lemon Tree came
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you guys are familiar with the
Lemon Tree, some say it was renamed from
[SPEAKER_09]: some other things, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But basically it had a very similar lemon
rind terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: I started washing some of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe 1% to 3% instead of less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, all right sweet,
a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We got something here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm still hunting this lemon terpene
profile, this lemon rind.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wasn't until recently that we
started finding some of these lemon rind
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene profiles that were actually
becoming viable.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that the farmer would give to me
that we're able to run, that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: yielding enough so that we didn't have to
turn that lemon flower into dried,
[SPEAKER_09]: cured flower on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the hash maker could actually get
some.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I want to big up men like Brandon,
third gen family, and men like Shiloh for
[SPEAKER_09]: breeding the lemon bean.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they've gone separate ways since
then.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they combined, helped to create that
strain called the lemon bean.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been finding specific phenos.
[SPEAKER_09]: That have that same lemon rind terpene
profile that are actually yielding.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one of my top strains right now
is finding that terpene that actually does
[SPEAKER_09]: do the work that we need to do to keep it
running through the lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's one of your favorite strains to run
right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I smelled some fire over.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did a little tour of his place earlier
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that they were taking down a
strain that smelled ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can talk on that if you want to.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's your favorite thing?
[SPEAKER_09]: The Gary Payton?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that Gary Payton smell loud as fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: For real though.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's your favorite strain so far
that you've run over there at that
[SPEAKER_09]: facility or in general?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you've ran stuff in Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've ran stuff in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in Spain I've been running a lot of
Dosidos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It yields really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the phenol that we have there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I talk about flavors, I like GMO a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry banana, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that papaya that it's been popular for
long now, I love it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of flavors, I like a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy tubes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually just recently followed the
trace of where that papaya came from
[SPEAKER_09]: because I was so intrigued by it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you guys are aware that the papaya
strain that's been going around,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's won a lot of cups.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you guys seen that recently?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I see the show of hands?
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you guys seen papaya win a cup?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was intrigued by this because a lot of
the strains are new.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the strains have been around
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I briefly touched on lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of people that say that
lemon tree has been around for a long
[SPEAKER_09]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember smelling that profile in Oregon
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it really, really got popular out of
Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this papaya strain, I think that a lot
of the seeds originally were bred by
[SPEAKER_09]: nirvana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I correct in saying that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nirvana seeds out of Europe is who
originally bred that papaya strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Oni Seed Co actually got a phenol
of papaya from a facility that I helped
[SPEAKER_09]: curate, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought those seeds from nirvana,
from Amsterdam to Colorado, and just
[SPEAKER_09]: recently found out that Oni Seed Co got
that cut from my facility in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_09]: has been continuing to breed it into this
cup winning strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: That strain actually came from your
backyard.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it all starts somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all in how you curate.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you curate it, how you hold it,
what you're stabilizing it with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And genetics play a huge role in what
we're doing out there playing with hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_07]: For each of you, as starting source
material, do you prefer indoor,
[SPEAKER_07]: outdoor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like both?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like depths, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoors always looks great, but it's a
little bit, it's like fugazi weed
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't beat the power of the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first started coming to California,
my family's had farms up north and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: always light depth weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this sour diesel that would have an
after taste to it that you could taste for
[SPEAKER_04]: hours after you smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just can't beat the flavor on
light depth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as far as price wise,
from a business standpoint, it's much more
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive to grow indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer light depth every time.
[SPEAKER_09]: But light depth over full sun,
what about if it's light depth during a
[SPEAKER_09]: time of year that you're having to use a
lot of supplemental?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: A full sun, it can be tough sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be a little dirtier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't had, in my experience,
you know, hash maker is only as good as
[SPEAKER_04]: your starting material, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't grow your own, you're
allowing a lot of variables into there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, I haven't been blessed
to have a super clean, clean outdoor farm
[SPEAKER_04]: to produce like a light depth scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I come from, when I first came to
California, and like you said,
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw my family had garbage bags full of
trim they were doing nothing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were never able to get that full melt
out of the outdoor, but light depth every
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the environmental control,
some of that wind barriers with the
[SPEAKER_09]: greenhouses up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could always tell if your farm was next to
a road for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I'd say I prefer indoor,
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a lot of experience with like
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fresh frozen mostly, mostly fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just seem to find a lot more
consistency with indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, a lot of it goes back to
like the flower rosin days and being able
[SPEAKER_06]: to, you know, just take a small amount of
weed and press it and see what a yield is
[SPEAKER_06]: from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of gives you an indicator on
whether, you know, there's a good resin
[SPEAKER_06]: content and if it's gonna even be a
contender for, you know, washing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, for me, I really like indoor
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And mostly because of the consistency and
variables and also like the turp retention
[SPEAKER_06]: without like, you know, depths I don't
have a lot of experience with.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, I think that's gonna be the next
best thing as far as all around.
[SPEAKER_06]: But indoor, you know, you don't really
have much of the leaf matter and it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: more of the turps and less of the plant
taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really like what's big for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard for me to talk about whether I
prefer full sun, prefer greenhouse depth
[SPEAKER_09]: or prefer indoor.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really about the environment and
whether you can control that environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've actually seen full sun grows in
desert areas like Colorado that just
[SPEAKER_09]: happen to be in this crazy valley where
the sun is perfectly hitting the plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no wind in this valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no dust and dirt being picked up
to hit these trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the best hash that I've ever
made in my life came from this full sun
[SPEAKER_09]: valley where it was just protected.
[SPEAKER_09]: The environment was perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: The temperature was right.
[SPEAKER_09]: The humidity was right.
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't have a lot of wind because it
was protected by this valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got amazing yields, amazing terpian
profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, big up Steve down there in the
desert because it was like a one-man
[SPEAKER_09]: thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was some of my favorite hash in
the world that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do see a lot more consistency in our
indoor operations year and year.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, it's all about environment
and genetics to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I can't really decide whether I
like depth or outdoor or indoor more.
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point, it's more so controlling
your environment and controlling your
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me that if you can control all the
details and you can grow with the sun,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't think that the quality of the
trichomes...
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I opened up with that was my
favorite grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: That full sun that was fully controlled.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a rare situation and not many farmers
get that availability to have that valley
[SPEAKER_09]: where no winds coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got the perfect sun.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I don't know if the full sun has
been replicated yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't beat the power of the sun,
in my opinion, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people have tried.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people are trying every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see a new LED light on the market each
and every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen plenty of outdoor hash that you
couldn't even tell if it was indoor or
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you tell sometimes with hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at the end of the day,
it's just trichomes and resin,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about yields and the terpene profile,
the flavor retention that your conditions
[SPEAKER_04]: allow you to get, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are all touring globally.
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of talk about different markets
and what you're thinking about for the
[SPEAKER_07]: next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the benefit to go to a lot of
places in South America, which is really
[SPEAKER_04]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombia and Chile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some experience in Colombia and
Uruguay, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Chile, but... Man, the cups,
every of the competitions down there are
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some motor oil getting pressed
down there in a lot of cases that people
[SPEAKER_04]: are extremely happy to have, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting to see a lot of the
technology and advancements that have
[SPEAKER_04]: happened in California, going over to
Europe and stuff, creating these
[SPEAKER_04]: higher-end ice-water hashes and live
rosins.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still foreign to even freeze any
product in South America.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring it down off the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no freezing anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you work with what you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting to see how far they come.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the cups down there are really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no live rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's none.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the stuff they do with cured
resin, this is where it all came from,
[SPEAKER_04]: was cured resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what you're seeing in a lot of
South American countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no live resins that we're so
accustomed to here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I smoke is live terapene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited after the show to check
out some of that dried material there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what's really exciting to me,
is that everybody's working with cured
[SPEAKER_04]: resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are different strains,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be surprised what a border keeps
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: The papaya making its way over from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But South America is really isolated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the legalities changing in South
America, and Colombia in particular being
[SPEAKER_04]: poised to be a major player in the
cannabis market, I'm really curious to see
[SPEAKER_04]: the strains that they produce for outdoor
and the hashes that they produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in a lot of senses, it'll be not
as superior as the States or Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that we're going to see some
really interesting things come out of
[SPEAKER_04]: there as far as mass productions and
solventless cartridges and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is not necessary to have extremely
great terapene profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more about the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how much they're able to do down there
is exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the US never stops innovating.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I wanted to touch on
real quick is the vastness.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it might not be the highest
quality production.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's just start from the seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I've seen happen in Morocco and in
Spain and places like Valencia,
[SPEAKER_09]: where a lot of the breeders are actually
doing the bulk, the breeding for the
[SPEAKER_09]: United States, for Europe, is the seed
selection is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're able to pop a lot more seeds in
phenohunt to a capacity that I haven't
[SPEAKER_09]: been able to see in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's one of the main advantages
that I've seen from my travels around the
[SPEAKER_09]: world is the ability to phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_09]: On a really, really specific finite level
because you can pop that many more seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: in places like Valencia and places like
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to see the ice water hash
market in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you were saying, that's the only thing
Europe's ever smoked is ice water hash and
[SPEAKER_04]: spliffs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be the hugest market for ice water
hash, which is my personal favorite of
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most unadulterated form of
tricheds or resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be a huge,
huge product as far as live and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as the market develops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really excited for Europe and Spain and
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have a lot of connoisseurs in
Spain because as I told you, we have big
[SPEAKER_03]: hash culture and there's a small amount of
people that they really love top quality
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are pushing and helping us to be
able to do high quality products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, and also there's a lot of people
now from England that they are introducing
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves to non-solvent extracts and
they have money and they are ready to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: for high quality products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for sure, I think the community is
going to grow in Spain and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the traditional hash producing
countries, are they still doing
[SPEAKER_07]: traditional methods or are they all
rocking the washing machines?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a mix of the two?
[SPEAKER_07]: And is there a future for dry synths?
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing for us, it's been really hard to
try to make them understand about quality
[SPEAKER_03]: because they've been doing, in Morocco for
example, they've been doing hash for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing tons of money every
season and when you go there and you
[SPEAKER_03]: explain them that they have to do it in a
different way to do it more clean,
[SPEAKER_03]: they realize that at the end of the season
they have 10 tons less than last year and
[SPEAKER_03]: they ask you who is going to pay for these
10 tons less?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't really care about quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: They care about money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, hash from Morocco becomes
more pure right now because European
[SPEAKER_03]: people is going there to train them,
but it's going to be really hard for them
[SPEAKER_03]: to change what they are doing for hundreds
and hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Extremely difficult, but at the same time
we have seen friends of ours bring freeze
[SPEAKER_09]: dryers from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: So technology is changing and they are
accepting of some new technology,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the hash that I've seen come
out of Morocco in the last two years since
[SPEAKER_09]: the freeze dryer technology has come into
play, they are using generators to power
[SPEAKER_09]: freeze dryers in the middle of Morocco,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this is real, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the hash that I've seen is
fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of my favorite hash in the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bring freezer tracks to Morocco from
Spain to do hash inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have to stop the conversation
now, but it's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work on the mountains, bro,
in the middle of nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's crazy that we are trying to
do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are fighting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen the same thing in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: When dabbing first became popular and I
went to Jamaica, you know, they saw the
[SPEAKER_09]: torch and they were like, no, we don't do
crack, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we don't smoke out of pipe,
Rasta.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, man, we smoke pure spliff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the first time we brought that
technology and that culture to Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_09]: they were scared, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that the e-nail and advance
like that have helped.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, really the education that we
pushed have helped as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the same thing that we're gonna be
seeing in Morocco, we started showing them
[SPEAKER_09]: what we can do with a freeze dryer and
what we can do with their material that
[SPEAKER_09]: they're growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: What strains we can bring into their
growing technologies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are starting to see some slight
changes in that realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to explain a little bit what's going
on in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Morocco, they have few problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main one is that they are growing on
the same land for hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the land, the soil is dead,
totally dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've been using chemical products to
feed the plants so that the soil is dead
[SPEAKER_03]: and full of salts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the yield of the plants is really low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the quality becomes from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if your plants are shitty,
the hedge is gonna be shitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can clean, you can use freeze dryer
machines, but when you grow a land,
[SPEAKER_03]: you cannot control all this soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small details that we control here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you know, hedge is something that
you do in a small batches.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you try to do big batches,
the quality is going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to control all the small
details that you have to control.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that everything is gonna change
in Morocco, but it's gonna be really slow,
[SPEAKER_03]: really, really slow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happening slow, but it's happening
slow all around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to think about how you move all
these hives from Morocco to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: In all this process, there's no
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your hives, it's gonna be fucked up
because the temperature, because the time
[SPEAKER_03]: that you need to move these hives from
Morocco to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Moroccan hash traditionally is a dry
sift hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying they're bringing freeze
dryers there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing a lot of ice water hash and
things there now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Small batches, as he mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited, as Peter touched on,
as far as dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, ice water hash and rosins have
come a long way, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've kind of forgot about dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys like Cuban are making super full melt
type of dry sift, which is an even more
[SPEAKER_04]: unadulterated form of resin head than even
ice water hash, to a sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with static and this different
technology, I think that that's gonna be,
[SPEAKER_04]: from a commercial production standpoint,
which is California's all about,
[SPEAKER_04]: can we scale it, is the most popular
question you get asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry sift has enormous potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You like dry sift?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like parts of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it as much as ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't quite think it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's exciting as far as creating a new
type of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us, I think, we know that water is
a solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We lose something on the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But something happened on the water
process that the quality that you have at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end, I feel that it's better than the
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's cleaner, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like a lot of this is the
strains and the variables.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in reality, I think to get enough
of a yield and to collect those heads,
[SPEAKER_09]: those heads have to harden out when we're
talking about dry sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: The heads don't have to fully have to
harden when we're talking about water
[SPEAKER_09]: hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we're able to retain a lot of
those water-soluble terpenes when we're
[SPEAKER_09]: making water hash compared to dry sift,
which those terpenes are falling off in
[SPEAKER_09]: the air to the environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because to enable to make sift,
you do have to harden out those heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we've seen some frozen sift,
some fresh sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know if the yields are going
to make it past that hash maker.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the issue that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about freeze-dried sift?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like freeze-dried flowers and sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've heard of people doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just not too sure on the yield and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what we wanted to get into in
the history of rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going to explain what we've seen
in the past.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's up to you guys to keep educating
and keep trying these different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Play with some frozen sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: Play with some freeze-dryer sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys were mentioning the terpenes
and yield are very important to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When choosing which strains to press.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was wondering also how important in
terms of terpenes are the medical aspects
[SPEAKER_01]: or the medical benefits of each strain
going into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they will be useful for in terms
of when deciding what to make.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a lot of this is unknown.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of this is just us playing with
these different things and doing R&D.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because for the longest time, we haven't
been able to do research on paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is still a federally illegal product
that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we actually do mention terpenes
because I personally highly believe that
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes have a huge benefit in the actual
interaction and how they make you feel.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I go back to the analogy of an
orange.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you crack an orange, generally most
people are going to smile when you open an
[SPEAKER_09]: orange.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a terpene that's present that's
making you feel that specific way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a lot of value in the
terpene combined with the specific
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids to make you feel a certain
way or help or benefit a specific affect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys want to touch on some of the
things you guys have witnessed?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, THC cannabis is actually
classified as like a psychedelic,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does have psychedelic qualities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anybody who's experienced with
psychedelics, you're set in setting,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how you experience the power of THC is
very much dictated on your mindset going
forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into it and a little bit of somewhat
aromatherapy and how that strain smelt
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like you like certain foods that make
you happy and certain foods don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: The terpenes have a big aspect on your set
in setting on creating a positive
[SPEAKER_04]: experience to start where the psychoactive
components of cannabis start to affect
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in a better place subconsciously,
almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think the way I look at it is
THC is the road and terpenes are the
[SPEAKER_06]: driver.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all not going to feel the same
off of each strain or the terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's like Ben was saying,
it really does have a lot to do with your
[SPEAKER_06]: mindset going into it and just your
overall feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just we're all going to find
what strains we like and the way we feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's getting to a point where,
with the extraction and stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're separating the terpenes from the
THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're able to concentrate the
terpene profiles and the THC profiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's definitely changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's going to be a lot of R
&D and observation with us trying it and
[SPEAKER_06]: figuring out how we like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for me, for instance, when we remove
the terpenes and you just have THCA,
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I dabbed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really like the way it makes me
feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get really high, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just don't like the overall high
from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I do a hit of THCA and then I do a
nice terpy dab, maybe two, it's way more
[SPEAKER_06]: relaxing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just more of a direction rather
than anxiety or just stuck in your mind
[SPEAKER_06]: thinking crap you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think terpenes give you a feeling
when you want to relax.
[SPEAKER_06]: You buy things with lavender.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps definitely dictate the way we feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think THC just boosts us up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a combination of all of those
cannabinoids is really important.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more thing to briefly touch on the
medicinal aspect and why we all talk about
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene so much is a good example is most
of these strains that we're finding
[SPEAKER_09]: extremely high in CBD, AKA strains that
are classified as hemp or drug variety
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp, strains like ACDC, strains like
harlequin, strains like the cherry or
[SPEAKER_09]: cherry wine and all these cherry crosses
that we're seeing now in the CBD world,
[SPEAKER_09]: canatonic, those strains all have a very
high beta-carrolophiline profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the terpene that's extremely
present in that series of strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: In all these CBD strains we're seeing now,
we're starting to see a few outliers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're seeing the bubba cushions that are
testing as hemp, which in reality hemp is
[SPEAKER_09]: just anything that's 0.3 THC and less or
less THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's being classified as hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what we're seeing in most of these
hemp strains, like I said, there are
[SPEAKER_09]: outliers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are finding CBD in strains that don't
have this terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for the longest time those strains had
that cherry or that cherry cough syrup
[SPEAKER_09]: flavor which was associated with
beta-carrolophiline.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beta-carrolophiline is also the smell
you're finding in anise and black pepper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anise and black pepper, if you look into
the history and what those things can do,
[SPEAKER_09]: those smells, the terpenes that come from
anise and black pepper, are there good for
[SPEAKER_09]: anti-inflammation.
[SPEAKER_09]: The same thing that we're seeing CBD is
good for.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that there's a lot of analogies
and things that we're gonna find and
[SPEAKER_09]: amazing combinations between the terpenes
and their counterpite cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're gonna do some amazing things for
the medicinal aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna say, I think that cherry taste
is the CBD in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta agree with that actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you know, when you isolated,
like I've played around with isolated CBT2
[SPEAKER_06]: and smoking it and I just find that heavy
cherry taste with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's where the name was coined.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's that terpene?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's terpenes at that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had distillate that tastes like
cherry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That exhale, you taste the predominant
cherry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I still think that it's terpenes that are
left in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else provides a flavor?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't think a molecule is gonna
have a flavor at that point.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I could be wrong, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over generations, whenever I've tried CBD,
when we extracted CBD from Ryan Laughlin's
[SPEAKER_09]: farm in Colorado, we got that same flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I've been seeing in history is
that flavor is associated with that black
[SPEAKER_09]: pepper anise type flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: The anise is very cherry-like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Black pepper anise beta carolophane,
which has been known for
[SPEAKER_09]: anti-inflammation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that there's gonna be a lot
of correlations between the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_09]: the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what we're gonna be fine tuning
as we move into the future and what rosin
[SPEAKER_09]: holds for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like pressing high CBD strands?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few that out there are nice,
but it's definitely not as exciting,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done some awesome demonstrations
that appear like we're running cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: THC heavy strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're washing it, it's turning out to be a
pure gold color.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're pressing it live.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did one at the Indo Expo that people
were like, how are you guys running weed
[SPEAKER_09]: out here?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like live, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hemp, 100% hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're actually gonna be doing one
together at the Dabadoo around Miami.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing some things out there with some
hemp that looks like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: As I was saying, there's a lot of kush
varieties coming out that are washing
[SPEAKER_09]: well, that smell amazing, that smell like
your bubba kush that you're seeing at the
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensary shelf.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's things changing every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited to see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think to get specific with that
question, with the tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_07]: acres of flavorful smelling hemp farm
flour, do you think there's gonna be a
[SPEAKER_07]: market for people wanting to smoke?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like there's a market for smokable
flour, some farmers are growing for those
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some farmers are still running a bunch of
seed crops and trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's definitely going towards
running for specific allocations,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether you're growing for smokable
varieties, whether you're growing for
[SPEAKER_09]: topical, whether you're growing for
extraction purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well also, I mean, talk about allocations.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have a lot of hemp farms out
there, you're talking acres and acres and
[SPEAKER_04]: acres of cannabis at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp is cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a hard time calling it hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing, just no THC like Nick
said.
[SPEAKER_04]: But who's gonna have, I mean, when you
have 20 acres of hemp, who wants to freeze
[SPEAKER_04]: all of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dried in barns and dried with much
less care than THC is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to get high quality solventless at the
end of the day is a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can save part of that crop if you
wanted to, to make a live rosin CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure it would come out amazing,
but the amount of people doing that are
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very minimal.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody, I hope to see that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we absolutely will again,
as the markets tend to mature,
[SPEAKER_04]: we will see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, I don't know if anybody's
doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things are changing because we went from
growing average of 7% CBD hemp crops when
[SPEAKER_09]: AG first certified hemp facilities in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're phenose selecting for
putting clones out and putting seeds out
[SPEAKER_09]: of over 20, 30% CBD crops.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are going out there to produce
CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is concentrate, you know,
and CBD distillate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's definitely out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're seeing the smokable varieties,
people pulling public kush, and the kush
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties coming out of Southern Oregon
right now are pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just to bring it back, like Ben said,
hemp is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just testing below 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are breeding now for trichome
production of CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been breeding for THC production
since hundreds of years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really going after it since what,
the 50s or 60s?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just starting to happen now with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, and give it five, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: We almost lost CBD because people were
like, oh, this stuff's not getting me
[SPEAKER_09]: high.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to get that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we almost lost it if it wasn't for
regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have to give thanks to regulation
and some over regulation for allowing us
[SPEAKER_09]: to test all these products.
[SPEAKER_09]: We literally almost lost CBD because lack
of testing and lack of the ability to be
[SPEAKER_09]: protected while testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of have a two-part question,
and you kind of touched on it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important are the smoking devices,
consumption devices, to the expansion of
[SPEAKER_00]: your market and bringing new people in to
enjoy these types of concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: new DAB rigs, e-rigs, opening up the
market to people?
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for each one of you, do you have a
device that you feel perfectly expresses
[SPEAKER_00]: the concentrate, the experience for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there devices that are inferior?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best method for each one of
you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm not the best to answer that
question because I mix with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to find another way to
smoke without tobacco, probably because
[SPEAKER_03]: that heat that comes from the tobacco,
I don't quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just smoke tobacco with my joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been trying a lot of device.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, the only one that I like is
the Pafco pick.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, it works really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to smoke rosin on the Pafco picks
and not in a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I mentioned, one of the scariest
things about promoting DABs when they
[SPEAKER_09]: first came to the industry and to the
community, to the world, was the torch.
[SPEAKER_09]: In reality and explaining to a lot of
people that are in a different generation
[SPEAKER_09]: that this torch is for healthy purposes
and for inhaling something via
[SPEAKER_09]: vaporization rather than combusting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a lot of things that were
really, really hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I do agree with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that devices like the Pafco
peak, and there's so many other devices
[SPEAKER_09]: coming out now, the Carta, who G-Pen just
put out a new device.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a ton of electronic dabbing
devices that are coming out to market that
[SPEAKER_09]: are a lot safer than utilizing a torch for
dabbing and that are a lot easier to
[SPEAKER_09]: travel with and a lot more portable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Much more approachable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've taken, to answer your question,
I prefer a rig, a quartz nail,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a torch every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing really that you really
cannot replicate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I actually think one of the coolest
tools, and I wasn't into it at first,
[SPEAKER_04]: is the thermometer that came out to
measure the actual temperature of the
[SPEAKER_04]: nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a dab a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really like, I never do it
without that now because you can get the
[SPEAKER_04]: exact temp.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think one of the most instrumental
things in making dabbing more
[SPEAKER_04]: approachable, I've dabbed with my
grandmother on the electrical devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's almost 80 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only ever smoked joints and I get to
tell her the new appreciation that we all
[SPEAKER_04]: have for hash and rosin now, which has
come a long way, let's say, since her time
[SPEAKER_04]: of smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a Pafco or a Carta, to put that in
front of her was so much more
[SPEAKER_04]: approachable.
[SPEAKER_04]: To take this generation who sees a torch
and thinks really hardcore drugs,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's really been the biggest revelation
and leap in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think that as far as
flavor-wise and what we're searching for
[SPEAKER_04]: on extracts, particularly solventless,
it's not matched with a nail and a torch.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to touch on that real quick just
because he mentioned something and you
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned something.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been coming up a lot recently.
[SPEAKER_09]: You mentioned that your favorite thing is
a torch with a timer.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, the whole timer thing has been
interesting because all nails are
[SPEAKER_09]: different, all environments are different.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you take that same nail and your same
dag rib that you're normally torching at a
[SPEAKER_09]: minute and 20 seconds, but you take it
outside in your backyard and that timer
[SPEAKER_09]: completely changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes from a minute 20 to 50 seconds.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's been some variables there that
have confused me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you just mentioned, this new device,
this Turp timer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Turpometer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually puts a laser on your nail
itself and gives you a reading.
[SPEAKER_09]: It touches a coil to it that actually
reads it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No laser touches a straight up coil to it
to get particularly a coil to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to have to be skilled.
[SPEAKER_09]: But now there's a new one out there that's
utilizing the temp tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: Temp tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that came out before the
Turpometer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just all about figuring out your
nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to talk about these things
because there are a lot of variables when
[SPEAKER_09]: it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: He mentioned the Puffco Peak.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all personal preference.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, in judging a lot of these cups,
I couldn't deal with the variables of the
[SPEAKER_09]: timers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked the Puffco Peak because I was able
to put it on a very specific temperature
[SPEAKER_09]: each and every time.
[SPEAKER_09]: The consistency so that I was able to give
an even platform to everything that I was
[SPEAKER_09]: judging was key to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I'm not saying that it was the best
dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys might actually have more
experience with their favorite dab,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I think it can be subjective.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for judging, most people are
probably just going to have access to a
[SPEAKER_06]: torch and a nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why most people are going
to experience it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A peak's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love a peak.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the go, I'd still rather have a torch
and a nail with me, but a peak is great
[SPEAKER_06]: for travels or things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just convenient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Ben was saying, to approach my
father-in-law with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't really smoke, but we're at a
wedding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, he's interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom, he hits it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The experiences that I've come across with
the peak is great because of how sleek it
[SPEAKER_06]: is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes away the whole stigma of a torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing smoking crack?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely a whole better approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think being at home, we all figure out
our ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got our glass for our beer,
a specific glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got our specific rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the time that we hit it at.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also going to change.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many variables because if
you're doing a fat dab, obviously you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to go in a little bit hotter.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of variables to all of that,
but it's just being a connoisseur about
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you love it, love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it to the fullest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it the way you love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen your judge cops rolling hash
into spliffs and I'm like, what the hell
[SPEAKER_04]: is going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's to each his own experience and
that's extremely worthy.
[SPEAKER_09]: People taste the actual resin in a bong
and they use that as their platform.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't taste it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just taste the weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people need a blunt.
[SPEAKER_09]: They need tobacco on the outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird to taste the weed inside and I
don't condone it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't condone utilizing the tobacco,
but for some reason, it's that standard.
[SPEAKER_09]: For them, it might be the taste of the
titanium nail or the torch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a little bit of the butane from the
torch has that standard effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: It tastes like that every time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying that that's the reason by
any means, but I think it's just a
[SPEAKER_09]: subjective answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm loving a lot of the handheld stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like one of the first things that
Puffco came out that really revolutionized
[SPEAKER_09]: things was their Puffco Plus, which was
the first ceramic insert portable pen that
[SPEAKER_09]: you could load your own.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a cartridge where you had to
rely on going to your dispensary to
[SPEAKER_09]: purchase that cartridge.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could make your hash at your home.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could make your oil, load it into that
Puffco Plus.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was a really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty cool one as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of devices out there from your hash
spliff to the peak to the dabber with the
[SPEAKER_09]: nail and the torch.
[SPEAKER_09]: If that answers your question,
sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I was just wondering if you guys had
heard of CBG?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the mother of all cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what every cannabinoid,
for the most part, that we see THC-CBG
[SPEAKER_04]: starts as.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, CBD or THC starts as CBG,
and once the plant matures, turns into the
[SPEAKER_04]: other cannabinoids that we value so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: So where is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you taken a plant down early and just
seen CBG?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you cut a plant early, you'll still see
the ratio of THC that you have,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you cut it early, you will see
extremely high levels of CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my experience, we cut a harvest early
at a facility in Connecticut for various
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons, and it had predominantly CBG,
and we got extremely high yields from our
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction, and I think we were seeing 50%
CBG in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was just almost a vegetative
plant at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So will the CBD, as it oxidizes,
will it basically transform or cross over
[SPEAKER_06]: to whatever it's supposed to?
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, if THC-A starts as CBG-A,
does CBG-A at some point oxidize,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's in concentrate form,
because THC-A will degrade to THC,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then THC degrades to CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does CBG do the same?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume so, but we never had it
around long enough to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've always infused it and put it out to
market into topicals and capsules and
[SPEAKER_04]: different things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember some research that we were into
at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBG was supposed to be a great cannabinoid
for cancer patients and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we pushed it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And capsules and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we didn't have the time to let it sit
around or try to decarboxylate it into the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids that follow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally don't have enough experience
with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, me neither.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you ask the question?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is it three times more expensive?
[SPEAKER_09]: More expensive than what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's three times more expensive,
because it's so rare.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to follow the question,
because I don't have a lot of knowledge on
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going for $10,000 to $15,000 a
liter in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be some hype, because in all
honesty, I think that the reason you're
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing a lot of CBG stuff might possibly
be due to what Ben's saying, is we're
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing higher concentrations of it if you
pull early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oregon had a huge freezing issue this
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of water.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of those farms pulled early.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to do something with that
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was seeing a lot of CBG distillate,
CBG kilos on the market in my forums,
[SPEAKER_09]: actually, just in the last three months.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that might be the reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be trying to create a market
for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBG, in my opinion, is easy to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hype.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's creating CBG?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So CBG, just because it's like,
oh, what's that acronym?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: THCV is super expensive too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a little bit more value,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But CBG is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut a plant early, you got CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to get.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a lot that we don't know about
all of these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their interactions with other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their interactions with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So really, I think that it's all going to
have to do with more testing, more
[SPEAKER_09]: education, freeing up the plant on a
federal level to really, really dig into
[SPEAKER_09]: the entourage effect, really.
[SPEAKER_09]: The interaction of the different
cannabinoids with the different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally don't know enough about CBG
and its effects alone to give an answer on
[SPEAKER_09]: that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard it has anti-inflammatory
properties.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-inflammatory properties?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone have a comment over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the Whistler Tech kind of
closed systems that they're coming out for
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask you about this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other kind of projects along those lines
and what that might do to just the
[SPEAKER_03]: production of... I mean, as a hash maker,
I think that we cannot be running a lab
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have equipment really expensive
and be using plastic bubble machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since I found that that company is
creating a big machine, stainless steel
[SPEAKER_03]: with a high grade, medical grade,
everything proper, I thought that that was
[SPEAKER_03]: the machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to say that the price is 250,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is important to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can afford... A quarter million
dollars?
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't know that part.
[SPEAKER_09]: Edu has actually gone and visited the
facility, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've gone and seen the machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you guys get to watch there?
[SPEAKER_04]: How was the quave?
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you doing fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were in a random facility that they
just bought the machine because the
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistler company, if they don't have a way
to show you how the machine works,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they don't buy wheat, so they don't buy
wheat, they do machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every time that they sell one machine,
they use that client to show to other
[SPEAKER_03]: clients how the machine works.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that facility, the people working on
the lab, they were just people from lab,
[SPEAKER_03]: not from hashish world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't know nothing about hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just running fresh frozen
plants, but I don't know why the quality
[SPEAKER_03]: became really low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not really sure if that machine is
being created to do a full male hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been created to do massive
production, probably with ham or with
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat, but not to do full male hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the question, though, and it's
something that a lot of us have been
[SPEAKER_09]: working on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a few units out there that are
100% stainless steel, and there's been
[SPEAKER_09]: other companies discussing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see a lot of value in the fully
closed loop version.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having stainless steel as your agitation,
but I still to this day have not seen
[SPEAKER_09]: anybody bring it to fruition and have the
agitation coupled with the separation in
[SPEAKER_09]: one unit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bubble bags, ice water extraction bags,
essential bags, ice extract bags,
[SPEAKER_09]: bolt bags, you name it, pollinator bags.
[SPEAKER_09]: These bags have been around for a long
time, and it's what we've used coupled
[SPEAKER_09]: with whatever agitation we're using,
whether we're using hand agitation with
[SPEAKER_09]: wooden oars or paddles, whether we're
utilizing a washing machine, as Eddie was
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioning, these plastic washing machines
that have been used in our little space
[SPEAKER_09]: and industry for the last 10 years,
or whether using one of the brand new
[SPEAKER_09]: Bruteless stainless steel barrels from
Pure Pressure.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a huge need right now to couple
that agitation, whatever it may be,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether it's magnetic or electronic or
mechanical agitation, with separation,
[SPEAKER_09]: because in reality, when we first went to
states like Nevada and talked to them
[SPEAKER_09]: about water extraction bags, they were not
for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The health department didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a lot of no's that came with
reusing nylon bags.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, as we move forward, there is a huge
need for some type of closed loop unit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, for one, have been working on a unit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got five, seven prototypes at this
point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still haven't found the exact thing that
I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm flying out next week to a place that
we're working on, but I hope to be another
[SPEAKER_09]: final one.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think a lot of us are working on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben looks like he's itching to talk about
his newest product coming out of
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosentech.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of people working on this,
and to be honest, whoever comes out with
[SPEAKER_09]: it first, I'm gonna support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same here, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that I think all of us are
drooling to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agitation is one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Collection is something totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with Whistler Tech and a lot of
the other machines I've seen who are
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to utilize the stainless steel mesh
is utilizing a totally straight,
[SPEAKER_04]: flat stainless steel, and to collect the
trichomes off that is not as easy as a
[SPEAKER_04]: bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bag is easy to put a spoon in there and
scoop it out nice and gently, and not
[SPEAKER_04]: disturb those heads, where if you try to
collect it from a straight-up stainless
[SPEAKER_04]: steel flat screen, you're just pushing,
smushing heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things that we've done delicate
harvest with to put all this energy into
[SPEAKER_04]: growing, and you're just smashing them
against the stainless steel screen is
[SPEAKER_04]: quite an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I have anything to announce,
but I'm excited to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where it's gonna go.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have been playing with... There's a
lot of people trying for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: These shaker columns, they're used to
separate paint or used to separate
[SPEAKER_09]: different sediment types and sizes.
[SPEAKER_09]: These shaker columns for years for dry
sift, but Edu mentioned that even with
[SPEAKER_09]: those units, we've seen a lot more raw or
crude end products that then have to be
[SPEAKER_09]: cleaned further.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is value to getting a lot of a
crude product and then cleaning further
[SPEAKER_09]: down the line, and I think we're all going
towards that same goal of finding a
[SPEAKER_09]: closed-loop unit that doesn't just produce
crude but produce the craft that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's always gonna be a market
for handmade hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't think that handmade hash is
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that even with these developments
of larger machines, whether it be even the
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing of handmade hash, it's always
gonna be slightly higher quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you get... I made handmade hash
that smelled like mildew and was black and
[SPEAKER_09]: pliable, though, back in Mendocino,
so there is value to changing up what we
[SPEAKER_09]: do and what we've known from the past and
being open to what's coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Whistler Tech, the closed-loop
systems are gonna be great for rosin
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction, for sure, especially if we're
going for full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's gonna take a lot of us
getting in there and really testing these
[SPEAKER_06]: machines and tweaking them and putting our
little techniques and really understanding
[SPEAKER_06]: what it's doing and what we can do to
change it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adjust it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any machine is just a base, but then you
start putting the people who have the
[SPEAKER_06]: craft and then they know what to tweak and
what to add.
[SPEAKER_06]: Add this, do this, modify this.
[SPEAKER_03]: My feeling when I was there, it was that
they are just people that they do
[SPEAKER_03]: machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do hash, so there's few points
that they don't understand how they have
[SPEAKER_03]: to do it because they don't do hash,
so they need people like us going there
[SPEAKER_03]: and telling them, hey, that machine is
good, but you have to change it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to change this and that,
or I need this or that on your machine,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we have to do it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of chemistry going into it,
whereas chemistry and hash making are two
[SPEAKER_04]: different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, we're separating heads,
we're mechanically separating oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of people developing these
products are from a chemistry background,
[SPEAKER_04]: a science background that is extremely
valuable but doesn't always translate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard to say that there's a
science to extraction because in reality,
[SPEAKER_09]: you make a rosin press, for example,
where you can create a certain pressure
[SPEAKER_09]: for a certain amount of time at a certain
temperature and you call it sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: You think that you're coming into your lab
and you're like, okay, perfect,
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a bunch of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to press the button that says
sour diesel and everything's going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: good because it's all programmed for the
sour diesel temperature and pressure and
[SPEAKER_09]: everything else, but not all sour diesel
is the same and not all rounds of sour
[SPEAKER_09]: diesel are the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's the same phenotype from the
same grow, but this round, he had too much
[SPEAKER_09]: magnesium or too much fossil load or
something, he added to that round and the
[SPEAKER_09]: pressure and the temperature changes up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really, really hard to just say that
you're going to press one button and
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going to be good to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis is a different plant and it has a
lot of variables associated with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it really matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all agree that us up here
have a true passion for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that part of what makes a hash
maker or somebody is to be able to define
[SPEAKER_04]: what is a good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the real sour diesel cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a good development of that cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different hues, different levels
to the terpenes that you can hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit comes with experience and
knowing what a good cannabis product is or
[SPEAKER_04]: hash or a good strain, a good turf
profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure, I've been doing hash for a long
time and I've been losing money a lot,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to find the best product.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have passion on doing hash,
you are not doing hash, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all consumers first, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the passion is what keeps us
dedicated and pushing forward in
[SPEAKER_06]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's why we've evolved so quickly in the
solventless movement.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of us on stage want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually loved hearing Nick,
you and Phil talk about the origins of
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still nerd out on that stuff where you
don't get to hear two guys like Phil and
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick talk about putting it to an email and
doing it five times.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that a lot of us really appreciate
and nerd out on those types of stories,
[SPEAKER_04]: the old genetic stories and the beef in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the juice.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is real oral tradition.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot of this is written down,
but we're going to tell it to you straight
[SPEAKER_09]: here today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for coming out, y'all.
We'll see you next time.
