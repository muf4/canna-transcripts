[SPEAKER_01]: What's top of mind right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chatting about people's experiences with
metric and Integrating onto metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something they're starting to roll
out Provisionals and annuals and so more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more people are starting to get
experience with that and we are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of that as well, so Just really
trying to Oh right glowing reviews super
[SPEAKER_00]: easy Yeah, and really kind of how it's
working with some of the So as a retailer
[SPEAKER_00]: we were not anticipating to have to order
tags and Tagging products because tags
[SPEAKER_00]: were supposed to be applied at the
cultivator level, but not everybody has an
[SPEAKER_00]: annual license Which is when you get the
tags or provisional so the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're handling that because the rules
state That anybody with a provisional or
[SPEAKER_00]: annual has to be on metric they They're
making any part of the supply chain get
[SPEAKER_00]: tags so how it's where I'm just wondering
how people are making it work and And I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to chat with you about this later if
you I don't know where you are in your So
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just getting started with our
account manager training so now with
[SPEAKER_02]: provisionals work coming on board and we
are Planning all-nighters with staff to QR
[SPEAKER_02]: code the world In terms of for retail
stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just to get all of the
tagging done is going to be really
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just preparing for the initial
Tagging of all of the inventory to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: big mountain and then hopefully once
everything in inventory is tagged then we
[SPEAKER_02]: can tag things as we receive it And it
won't be as much of a challenge and it
[SPEAKER_02]: will start to become integrated But I
think the first time when we get
[SPEAKER_02]: everything into inventory and metric is
going to be the hardest because some of
[SPEAKER_00]: our issues are not all of our vendors have
provisionals or annuals and therefore earn
[SPEAKER_00]: on metric and don't need to have tags and
some distributors do some of the products
[SPEAKER_00]: that other distributors that don't have
one do and so we're right now gauging like
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of actually Provisional or
annually licensed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vendors that we work with and versus how
many products we're gonna have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tagging ourselves and that was something
that was never anticipated that Kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: defeats the whole point of track and trace
in my opinion because we're just it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: going one more step and it's supposed to
come from the cultivator, but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody anticipated the rollout and the
sort of the imbalance of temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses to provisional licenses and so
making that work at this stage has become
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more complicated than
Originally thought for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's been some guidance about
if you are working with vendors that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have Unique identification in metric yet
what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, but it remains to be seen what
that's like when we're actually doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so that's I'm trying to find
Somebody that's been doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's so few people most people are
in the exact stage that we're in So none
[SPEAKER_00]: of us really it's kind of like when we
first started with the manifests and the
[SPEAKER_00]: excise tax and like when that first rolled
out and we were all We were all figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: it out as we go and and not everybody
apparently saw that there was a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: form that was on a website that people
could use so people were making their own
[SPEAKER_00]: forms and then there were discussions on
or maybe debates between the distributors
[SPEAKER_00]: and and retailers over like who collects
what and how much and who keeps what
[SPEAKER_00]: records and and how that whole thing works
and I feel like this is probably going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be very similar to that process one thing
that I stay up at night thinking about in
[SPEAKER_02]: relation to metric is our planned
dependency on our third-party software
[SPEAKER_02]: providers for POS and for our seed to sale
tracking at cultivation and distribution
[SPEAKER_02]: and and how we've Received promises over
the last year or so as we've onboarded
[SPEAKER_02]: these different tools that they are going
to integrate and That moment when it turns
[SPEAKER_02]: on yeah how well it really integrates and
and if that is going to add to the
[SPEAKER_02]: complication or be a support because
obviously When you are using a third-party
[SPEAKER_02]: software provider to integrate With metric
the hope is that that added cost is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring you benefit Operationally,
it's going to be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to save you time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to give you better business
intelligence but we don't really know
[SPEAKER_02]: right and The software tools our company
because we operate across the supply chain
[SPEAKER_02]: We have multiple different software
providers that we're using that are all
[SPEAKER_02]: claiming that they'll integrate with
metric Right, but then they all are
[SPEAKER_02]: positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were at the same moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also all rolling out new versions
So that the metric integration works So
[SPEAKER_00]: it's yeah, yeah, I'll be asking people at
Meadowlands if they have any experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with that yet because that's that's
something I'm very curious to hear and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just saw one of our vendors is has a on
metric and has a code and I I got sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked I was like it's very very long
code I don't even know how many digits
[SPEAKER_00]: there are but there's a barcode too and I
think there's a question of whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: the POS system or inventory system handle
that many numbers can actually I'm like I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope it reads it can read the the barcode
because that's gonna be a lot of manual
[SPEAKER_01]: input Are you implying that other vendors
who submit stuff have shorter?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're all issued by metric or if you
if you aren't on metric yet, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have a metric ID number, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you said their ID number was really
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Which implies that you've seen other
ID numbers that are much shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never that was actually the first real
I ever saw yeah, our buyer just sent me a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of it because I was asking and it
was it's it's long and then I saw I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay There's a barcode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope that our scanner can read it
For all intents and purposes early June
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019 you're literally seeing your first
metric Barcode whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it We're not on metric yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going through the training process
right now, but Mid yeah, I mean very soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I one of our Distributors is on metric
so and I was I've been asking like did
[SPEAKER_00]: anything change with their process and how
they were dealing with us and Just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of information gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to learn nobody really It's
too new We'll get there Requirement that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be on it at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah within 30 days after you get your
provisional or annual and did you just get
[SPEAKER_01]: your Provisional or annual recently.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in that the clock is ticking for
you Yeah, but there's different phases
[SPEAKER_02]: going on in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of the cultivators their
temporaries expired earlier before the
[SPEAKER_02]: retailers so theoretically a lot of the
cultivation Licensees would have been on
[SPEAKER_02]: metric Yeah now but it's taking a while
for metric to onboard people because while
[SPEAKER_02]: the licensees have 30 days From when they
get the invitation to do the account
[SPEAKER_02]: manager training.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a bit That is dependent on the
state inviting you to that training
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduling the onboarding and The the
supply chain just not everybody's on it
[SPEAKER_00]: right and and because of that the
retailers are gonna have to be tagging
[SPEAKER_00]: products for Distributors or or supply
chain members that are not on it Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that have provisional licenses,
it's very complicated But it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: the next but this is what you're like your
smile Well, what about I mean you were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about certain things where I feel
Like in an ideal world a phone call to the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators to get clarification on my
confusion is Like the different regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies have different interpretations of
different lines and The law right and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of you adhere to one regulatory agency So
you're gonna listen to what they say
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas you have a retail and the brand,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I don't I'm not seeing
regulatory Agencies having different
[SPEAKER_02]: interpretations of the law luckily I I
would say that there are regulations that
[SPEAKER_02]: might be challenging for businesses that
we have to navigate but I'm not having the
[SPEAKER_02]: BCC tell me one thing and CD FA tell me
something that conflicts with BCC you are
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I win in just strictly looking at
the regulations as written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worse in a previous version of
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a lot of really good Work to
clean that up and and be more consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board So the the issues that
were really outstanding to me Aren't they
[SPEAKER_00]: those have been mitigated now at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing I mean I can still see
Certain conflicts when one might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to argue in like between state law and
some of these regulations I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it depends on what lawyer you ask on
what day Well, okay, so in in malcursa it
[SPEAKER_00]: says that all Cannabis and cannabis
products have to be in a child resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: tamper evident resealable package So
cannabis the definition of cannabis means
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and Although I so the
regulators they say and I think rightly so
[SPEAKER_00]: are exempting clones and seeds from
portions of that rule One might say that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you know kind of differs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't at all addressed or clarified in
the Previous version and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: different between because a CD pH didn't
address Clones or seeds because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly focused on manufactured products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the closest was pre rolls with
Extracts in them was the closest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no pre-roll regulation we
were having debates with vendors about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not the universal symbols apply
because they were like well you only Dph
[SPEAKER_00]: is only responsible for these things and
they're the ones that say universal symbol
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't have to have one and then go
well no, this is the the law says you do
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way I look at it is the malcursa
is like the Bible and The regulations are
[SPEAKER_00]: like the gospel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when it Finds out go to the law
and then go to the regulation some people
[SPEAKER_00]: work backwards I think it depends on the
situation to like really it's not black
[SPEAKER_00]: and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a lot of nuance and a lot
of like the if you're in line with the
[SPEAKER_00]: intent of what the law is and what 64 is
and And you work towards that which is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I said on the panel like you can
prove your intent to comply Be within,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the letter and the spirit to the
best of your ability then that's that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best approach in a confusing
complicated ambiguous developing industry
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts on that she's really smart You
You You You You You
