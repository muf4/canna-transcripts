[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to do, uh, clothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, like, uh, work wear
clothing, like car hard, like real,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the hemp is really good as far as
it lasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Levi used to build their Levi's
at a hemp and then they moved the cotton
[SPEAKER_02]: because the cotton wears out.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently Tesla is using hemp in what
it's seats.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says you're going to imagine sales make
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to, I'm going to,
this year I'm doing the hemp and I got,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do eight acres and I'm going
to do it orchard style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, you know, rather than a lot
of people are just, you know, doing a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as much as they can fit on one
acre, I'm going to try and grow trees
[SPEAKER_02]: quality and then just process that whole
plant from stock, you know, basically from
[SPEAKER_02]: root up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, eight acres, like, is that
comparatively, that's a good amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a big fur for right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go too big, I don't have the budget.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I fail, would this be your,
so this would be your first, this will be
[SPEAKER_02]: my first, uh, well, no, I grew some hemp
last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, what area are you like,
what's the appellation you want to Anza,
[SPEAKER_02]: Anza, Wonga, but give me something more
people like rivers, rivers, Temecula.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate saying Riverside County because
everybody's like, oh, it's, I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's Riverside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's a stigma to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Riverside County, Anza Appellation,
Appellation, A-P-P-E-L-L, High Country
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Humboldt guys are like, yeah,
wait, wait, that's our name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, but you're Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're High Country.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's their name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Theirs is Humboldt County Growers
Association.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's, I mean, the thing is,
you know, that's the, it's the same
[SPEAKER_11]: letter.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a Southern and there's a
Northern HCGA.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but why did you, I mean, not that it's
not legitimate, but what High Country is,
[SPEAKER_11]: is that what you guys call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that region's kind of High
Country, like anything that's coming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the, the four ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that has a meaning.
[SPEAKER_11]: People know it.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you go, I grow in the High Country,
people go, oh, they know it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well then that would be a legitimate part
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're out in that area,
like all the, like the 4-H club,
[SPEAKER_02]: for instance, is High Country 4-H and like
the newspapers, High Country Journal and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's kind of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to do some of the other guys
were like, now let's do High Desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, it's not really,
we're not really the High Desert,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's specific.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't, you wanted your name to
represent, and it's important where you're
[SPEAKER_11]: from, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that was a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, this is so crazy to me because
only California, like, but California,
[SPEAKER_11]: not only, but most of all, has all of
these local associations.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the scheme of things, you figure
it's not going to last because,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, as the industry matures,
there should not be the need for- For so
[SPEAKER_11]: many.
[SPEAKER_11]: So many.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then weed them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they really combine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they combine, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the moment, cause I was surprised
cause I've been covering the industry for
[SPEAKER_11]: like five, six years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and I've talked to lots of people in
different associations, especially around
[SPEAKER_11]: California.
[SPEAKER_11]: He goes, yeah, High Country Growers
Association.
[SPEAKER_11]: I go, I never even heard of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's pretty new too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was the interesting point to me
that even now, kind of like after,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, a little bit of time,
there's still a need to create a new
[SPEAKER_11]: association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there, there's a Coachella Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Association, Growers Association,
or Coachella Cannabis Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all about indoor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, but it's still growers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And often these associations for these
areas will represent not just growers,
[SPEAKER_11]: but the ancillary industries as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what these guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more retail manufacturers,
distributors, because they're down in
[SPEAKER_02]: Coachella Valley and they're working with
all those different entities down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're like, oh, you know,
we need to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with him, we kind of butt heads with
them because he doesn't like us because
[SPEAKER_02]: we're the black market guys, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're the dudes that like.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you wouldn't start an association if
you were kind of weren't interested in
[SPEAKER_11]: going legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the whole reason we started it
was because we were getting screwed in reg
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, we got to come,
you know, we got to get like-minded guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause up there, nobody really wants to
expose themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's 20 million plus people
out right around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no real reason to come out and
say, hey, look at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I grow and I want to make a
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's happy because the reality is,
is people are showing up in suitcases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going back to Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need this, that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easy because they can fly into
LA, San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there in an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so broken up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have, it's so large of a vast
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go right into our little area and
you can, one broker can see five different
[SPEAKER_02]: products from, from 10, you know,
different farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Within a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Easy in and out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's, you know, I mean,
yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesse Jody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you, Jody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I think the Appalachian up
there's really, will really take off
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the tourism and the Canada
tourism that, you know, cannabis tourism
[SPEAKER_11]: has to resound like whether they're there
or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, so that like someone, no matter
where they are, they're going to want to,
[SPEAKER_11]: like if they're in France.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but, so, but you, so you, you guys are
only grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the association, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's all grown.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how new you, how old, how long has it
been?
[SPEAKER_02]: We formed it back in 2018 of March.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you got a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: A year and a half.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, have you grown a lot in that time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really because I put my face out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in newspapers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually got a guy who's running for
county supervisor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we were getting fucked and we're
like, well, we might as well just take the
[SPEAKER_02]: seat from you, you know, and if we don't
get it this time, we'll get it next time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like right now is he, yeah,
he's, yeah, he'll be right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just posted a bunch of shit on my
Facebook, you know, to like kind of look
[SPEAKER_02]: for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, you know, I think he's
actually, he's got a chance.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not that many people vote do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and when, when you take areas like
that to where they're rural areas and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to get the word out there and you
know, a lot of people don't really care
[SPEAKER_02]: to, like I said, a lot of those people,
you know, they mind their own business,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: They grade their own roads and they might
not even vote, but they might vote.
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's someone who will like go,
look, I understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm one of y'all leave you alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was like, I was like,
dude, I'm not a voter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not even going to, I don't
believe in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I don't believe in a two party
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It divides us, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but he's like, no, you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about I donate a little bit of money
and I pump you, you know, I put your name
[SPEAKER_02]: out there and help you out a little bit,
but they're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cool family.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're from Mexico in Sonata
explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Canagar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to get into making these and I
was like, fuck, that's a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to do them handcrafted,
you know, and hand roll, like you got,
[SPEAKER_02]: they got these presses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stick them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that one time I did now I'm,
I'm, you know, if I'm going to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: something, it's going to be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, I mean, I don't see anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the other day, a guy up here was
rolling and he, but he didn't say he was
[SPEAKER_11]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I took a hit and I'm like,
is there tobacco in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of for me, it's like you're
ruining it.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, yeah, some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: For 17 years in St. Croix and all the
locals roll Fanta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey dip tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, obviously Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, likewise.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be drinking because obviously in
Amsterdam, the locals do that too.
[SPEAKER_11]: They mix them and they always have,
and they go, Oh, it's cause I don't want
[SPEAKER_11]: to get that high, but it's like,
it actually adds something.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, no, you know, just cannabis
alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that it adds what, what cannabis
does is the tobacco and no, I know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they think it's adding something to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it is is cannabis is an enhancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whatever that terpene or you know,
flavonoid, whatever's in the tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: that's giving you that high, the cannabis
is kicking it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're getting the boats.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they're saying, yeah,
we need this for the opioids because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can do a little bit of cannabis and half
the opioids you were doing before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be, you know,
effective.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey preschool dad, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why don't you introduce us to your
appellation of origin?
[SPEAKER_09]: And talk about what you're growing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the appellation of origin that,
that I would like to see happen one day is
[SPEAKER_02]: out in Riverside County out in the Anza
Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it sits at about 4,000 feet,
3,800 to 4,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, it's one of the personally,
I think it's one of the best places in
[SPEAKER_02]: North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the microclimates, the dry,
the, the way the sun hits this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: region, it sits on the 33rd parallel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, it, it duplicates the same as a lot
of these strains that come from Morocco or
[SPEAKER_02]: Lebanon that sit in these same regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, it, it's one of those spots
that you really got it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's small.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only 16 miles by eight miles,
a 16 miles long by eight miles wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a small little region and,
um, and cannabis has been grown there for
[SPEAKER_11]: a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people have been growing up there
since this early seventies.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's an important, um, uh,
element of the creating an appellation
[SPEAKER_11]: that you can also show, you know,
a history of sort of, uh, use,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, and, uh, for a particular crop
or growing in the genetics then also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys have been underground for so
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to show that history.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true, but the plant doesn't know
whether it's legal or not legal,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, so the, the plant history is
still there and that's really,
[SPEAKER_11]: the people who are looking at appellation,
that's all they're going to need to care
[SPEAKER_11]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The science, as far as the genetics and
the plant morphing back into her,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, space and knowing that,
Oh, this is where I'm supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where I thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not too humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the perfect dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the perfect altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the perfect way the sun hits the
plant and all these things come into play.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there particular strains or genetics
that do well there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the, the, the Afghan or Indo Kush
strains, all those into Kush strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that, that came from the Hindu
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain range or Afghan mountain range
would do well in this area because all
[SPEAKER_03]: your OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great because it sounds exactly like
wine, you know, like that's how they got
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma nap on the same parallels is
burgundy and Bordeaux and stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything you're saying just translates
right across.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start connecting that and really
doing the research into, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still farming, but once you start
connecting those parallels and realize,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is why this works so good in this
region, then it clicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easy, it's easy to place that
cultivar where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not, you know, growing some
sativa up there and going, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it's getting huge because it's
getting the sun and she's getting what she
[SPEAKER_02]: likes, but it's not producing what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've learned up there that
you can mix these sativas into some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these heavy Indicas and come up with
plants that are yielding eight pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so do you guys have a voice at
the groups that are working on this
[SPEAKER_11]: California Appalachian CCIA has a group,
you know, you got to get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet, you know, not yet, but we're
working towards that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, like I said, it's a small
region and it's taken time to get like
[SPEAKER_02]: minded people together and that would
increase the value.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a valley like that where,
you know, the environment is like really
[SPEAKER_11]: conducive.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why that's key is to get licenses
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's the other problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all incorporated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all incorporated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other problem is the
license process has gone to where they
[SPEAKER_02]: want things to go indoors and,
and to have an Appalachian, we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you have an Appalachian if you're
growing indoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the huge problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you call it an Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, which, which I was going to ask
about, cause you know, even up in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_11]: and in, uh, up in the emerald triangle,
like they grew in pots up there a lot,
[SPEAKER_11]: but they still want their Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_11]: Should an Appalachian only apply to in
ground?
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally, for me, I'm finding that the
native soil up there is fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this stuff, you cannot make it up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's up in the fort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what kind of, is it like,
uh, no, it's more of a mineralized,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're, we're in a, you know,
a highly mineralized rather than forced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I'm finding is by,
by having soil that's neutral,
[SPEAKER_02]: high in mineral, it's a lot easier to,
to manipulate the plant when she's in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said it's fungally dominant,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding that, that, you know,
when we were pressing some of our
[SPEAKER_02]: material, like I was talking to the guys
from Sasquatch, we were talking and they
[SPEAKER_02]: were saying a lot of the stuff that
they're pressing from up north,
[SPEAKER_02]: has that fungal flavor in it because of,
of, you know, there's so much plant matter
[SPEAKER_02]: up there that's breaking down into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much fungus and fungus,
you know, the right words, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: that breaks down and now plant sucking
that up into the flowers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more neutral to where it's,
you're able to, when it starts going into
[SPEAKER_02]: flower rather than you know, you're,
you're able to take the plant and really
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulate the flower process rather than
some places up north, you get into where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, you're stuck in that soil that's
full of broken down fungi and the leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: and all this stuff that, that you don't
necessarily want the plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're stuck with that in the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you press it, we're finding
that, you know, by pressing flower up
[SPEAKER_02]: there and flower down here, you're seeing
a huge difference in, in the turps and the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor and all that stuff, you know,
and I think a lot of it has to do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you think you're getting a,
a pure expression of the genetics down
[SPEAKER_11]: here?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: With more of a neutralized soil and more
of a mineral, high mineral, high mineral
[SPEAKER_02]: content.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do these minerals, do they have any
taste or, I mean, Well, what they do is
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant takes those minerals and makes
different terpenes and different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but that makes it just unique to the
area then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what makes the Tuareg so
important when the soil comes into play
[SPEAKER_11]: because, you know, now- Can you always
tell flower from that area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few.
[SPEAKER_11]: And is it the smell?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a smell and there's a few
little unique things that give it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the outdoor stuff's got these little
flowers in it that blow,
[SPEAKER_02]: that blow off in the wind, layers there,
mountain layers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So actually start, start from the top
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're, you're at 4,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at 38, but the valley's about from
4,000 to 3,500.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, it's got a very dry
climate to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain micro climates within the
valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my area is a lot different than some
of the areas that are a little bit further
[SPEAKER_02]: east.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a little higher up,
which I get kind of a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: coastal eddy that comes in and kind of
keeps it a little bit warmer than some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the areas that are higher up that don't
get that coastal eddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So where do you get your, cause we just
came from this conference, where do you
[SPEAKER_11]: get your energy and your water?
[SPEAKER_02]: The waters, I sit on an aquifer,
so I'm on a well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all groundwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is anyone doing any dry farming up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get another, if we get some good
rain hopefully here- Do you work dry
[SPEAKER_09]: farming into every conversation?
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a good topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the answer?
[SPEAKER_11]: It seemed appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, and I think I can do it because
where my water table is, I sit in a little
[SPEAKER_02]: valley with an aquifer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's why the aquifer, it has to be
like, it's all about the aquifer and then
[SPEAKER_11]: that plants doesn't need any water at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you can get this, if you do by
seed, you're going to get that taproot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally think, you know, you can get
a taproot to go at least six, if not
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six feet, eight feet maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should talk to some of the farmers who
are doing this up along the Eel River.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been, they have several years
under their belt and they'll, they'll
[SPEAKER_11]: share, they'll share with you all day
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if, if you do, you, you start them
and you, you starve them what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I do grapes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got grapes and Malbec, Malbec,
Petite Sarah is what I got going right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Malbec fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sit on the same parallel is that the
Argentinian stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big fan of Malbec.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just a hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the hobby race.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's for pressing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not for eat or are they for
eating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Press their wine grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some table grapes, some,
um, I'm playing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't, you know, it's wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a process, but it's,
it's a fun hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's another, it's another one
of those hobbies I enjoy when you grow
[SPEAKER_02]: things and then you get to enjoy the
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have eucalyptus, the baby, the sweet gum
eucalyptus, the ones for the, the forestry
[SPEAKER_02]: arrangements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you finding that flavor in your
grapes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I can tell I have a terrible
palette, but eucalyptus and green pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell if there's a tree on the
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great pesticide though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, because we're so, so dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do the, the OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm pulling stuff in late
November, you know, when people are
[SPEAKER_02]: panicking up North in September,
all right, here, all right, here comes the
[SPEAKER_02]: water, you know, here comes the rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're sitting back and just,
you know, it's, it's definitely one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those spots where the future is going to
be in these appulations in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what cultivars are coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a watershed basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the most pristine water
shelves in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that good, clean water is,
is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: My water comes out at, at six,
eight pH seven, seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because it doesn't hot springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to do a lot of work crap water
down there, crap water, whole different
[SPEAKER_02]: deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, DH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing up there is we got
pristine water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we sit on a water shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's feeds a big part of Southern
California, you know, and so that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a big key for a lot of us is to be
able to have clean water and not have to
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse Osmosis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just quickly, are these different
cultivars?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are we, can we start with the
camp?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that thing looks yummy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you need to be proud of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so what the fuck is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hand make a bunch of them every year
when I harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so interestingly, I, in my mind,
I thought you would, you'd cure the outer
[SPEAKER_09]: leaves first, but you actually wrap it
fresh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you cure the flowers cured.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll wrap it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With leaf that I pick and then let it cure
after the fact on there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then I'll use a little bit
of rosin to basically glue those on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even a little bit of Keefe in
there to just kind of bind everything
[SPEAKER_02]: together and kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, it's, it's a, it's the aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so much the high, you know,
it's more of just the aroma of the whole
[SPEAKER_13]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a torch?
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a, you will see in one second.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to start glowing in a
second.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be very hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really cool, but seriously
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, so you roll, because you got to do
a kind of bed harvest because you need,
[SPEAKER_09]: you need those fresh leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how many do you roll a year?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you keep them in like a humidor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a cigar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do like maybe a dozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's a fine line because if
you're going to wait for the cannabis to
[SPEAKER_03]: cure properly and you need fresh leaves,
it runs into a time issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a craft thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that, you know,
there, there's a lot of guys that are
[SPEAKER_02]: making them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guys are more into the craft part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some guys just want to mass produce
them.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long to make what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll do them different,
you know, sometimes I'll put a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: Keefe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Keefe on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one's.
[SPEAKER_11]: That should take a few days to actually
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take a few days to, yeah,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take some time to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this thing ready, Peter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing different circles, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the strain in there?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we may have missed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh oh.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're not in the streaming networks.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the Tangy Girl, which is a
Tangy and Girl Scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are really, really nice trips.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you wouldn't expect from such a really
tight bud.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is like, rock solid.
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you cure for it?
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just a regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to over seven days dry and then the
cure processes can be from three weeks to
[SPEAKER_13]: a month.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: How much are you getting out of a plant?
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we don't use that as a metric
anymore, but I guess some plants that'll
[SPEAKER_02]: yield four to five pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some that'll do eight.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were getting a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have like different parcels where
you're doing different, like some are
[SPEAKER_09]: bigger plants and some you're going
smaller.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some you're planting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, do you do everything from
seed?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is like a cigar.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to get it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you break out the scotch?
[SPEAKER_11]: I will gladly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Callum 18 was his and I have.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically just hit the button.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it takes like 10 or 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: So get it getting back to everything's
from seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And where are you getting this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it your it's all my personal seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you're doing the breeding what
indoors or how are you keeping that one
[SPEAKER_09]: male away from your head?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not always the easiest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just very carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do indoors and trap that pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you put it to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You put a stick in the middle,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you pulled it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get that drug.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's not one of my better ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a decent one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nurseries.
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to own a nursery.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, so.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know all of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you don't need to go back away.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've you've touched most of the
genetics that have come from California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother had some really good genetics
late 90s.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That some of it I've been able to hold on
to.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of it I've lost.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what did you project to find all the
old stuff that Kevin was doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, what did you callio project?
[SPEAKER_02]: Callio is a hard one to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a lot of like the old original
like San Fernando Valley stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did that taste good?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's in the joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tangy, tangy girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what was this one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangy girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's that you can actually take down
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Dave.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave with smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sure can.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the microwave knocked everything out
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first thing to dry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got off the beginning of it was just
like, oh, yeah, that's our big guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have a dumb how it's going to taste
like a forbidden fruit kind of like cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to smoke at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what the numbers are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to react well with your body.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that full wrapped up around
numbers and THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So by the way, Saturday night,
I was all alone back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you didn't want any part of the
Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a long night.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fun night, but a long night.
[SPEAKER_03]: We usually sit back there and just hold
corn, just trying to smoke all night.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's been kind of like the history of
genetics in the area?
[SPEAKER_09]: And is it like what do you travel around?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, do you see, do you go up to like,
no, kind of see what they're growing in
[SPEAKER_09]: different places?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in my area, kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is right now is there's a lot
of the new stuff that's out there and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of it's clone material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's really nothing that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, that I would say,
Hey, yeah, this is what we need to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure this is known in this Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really found that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some hogs brick that's floating
around out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's decent, but it's,
and then you also have the problem of
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are now realizing,
Oh, my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else has these genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, I don't want anybody else to have
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so people are guarding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's what you're finding is a lot of
people are like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and so does that imply that like 10 years
ago, people were like, you need seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 10 years, they didn't even care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, Oh, you know, 10 years ago
there, it wasn't, you weren't thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about spreading genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it was up North, you know,
the way it was up North was everybody knew
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, we need to start building up a
name with genetics and I need to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder and I need to be known for this
cultivar here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about what's, what's making me
money and what's making me money now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's about where's your market and
who's your market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, volume,
of course, but it's knowing where your
[SPEAKER_02]: market is and who your market is too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, right here, right now is the
OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants that gassy OGs,
you know, because most likely it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: East.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, and so nobody's
really, that's all people care about right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to open a bag and get hit
by that gas rather than what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the Terps that I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: selling?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But are you growing for the market and
then growing for kind of like what you
[SPEAKER_09]: like?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're entirely different things.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what everybody's finding.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruity, fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this, you know, I like fruity with,
I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is fruity, but it's got that gas
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get you, it's going to kind
of get you stoned, but you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be couch locked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still going to be able to have a
conversation somewhat.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: The black markets are like real pure
markets, but they're also because they are
[SPEAKER_11]: the purest market, but also kind of like
blind because you really don't know you're
[SPEAKER_11]: a consumer at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're growing for yourself.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the legal market, you have,
it's like that, you know, if it's not
[SPEAKER_11]: selling in the stores, you're getting
lapsed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm getting laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to like, do you guys want any
more of this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can say, yeah, let's work on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we started with an aggressive
pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that, you know, because I consume a
lot of cannabis, I want that full,
[SPEAKER_02]: that full spectrum flavor of all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to just be knocked on my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to, I want to,
I want to function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to function,
but I also want to feel, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get very creative and I smoke certain
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I want to, you know,
I want, I don't want to be, I'm,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dying of cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so for me it's uppity stuff,
you know, and it's, and it's taken those
[SPEAKER_02]: sativas and mixing it with different
things that I know, okay, this is going to
[SPEAKER_11]: get me pretty stuff for sick people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just for the, they, if you want to
be slow, you're doing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about like, there's,
there's a lot of wines.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would, I, I prefer like the lower
alcohol wines just because that way you
[SPEAKER_07]: can enjoy it and drink more of it as
opposed to like these high content,
[SPEAKER_07]: high alcohol content.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of like, that sounds like
what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never really thought about the fact
that different wines have different,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, and it's a tremendous difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, like beer, I always
think of it with beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a big difference when you're like
saying, okay, I want to have four or five
[SPEAKER_07]: glasses or more, you know, depending on
how your evening is going, you're just
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that makes a big difference on
how, you know, if you like, just want to,
[SPEAKER_07]: like you said, it's starting to make
sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: What if the wine has a higher alcohol
content, but it also has that flavor and
[SPEAKER_11]: body that you just love.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to, you'll just maybe,
maybe just sip on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to like really, you know,
it's the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, smokers totally know their
modulate there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I find mixing flowers when
you're smoking them in a, in a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole point is also a way to,
you know, when you're blending like wines,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're blending different grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get this really cool effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just mix a little bit of this at
the tip of, you know, and a little less of
[SPEAKER_02]: this at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is music to our ears, but it's like,
it's the antithesis of just, just throwing
[SPEAKER_11]: a whole bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, this is quality talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: During the day while I'm working,
I smoke a combination of Durbin and ACDC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get all the focus and concentration
with a 30 to one ACDC strain, but then all
[SPEAKER_03]: the uplifting, you know, go get them
sativa style from the old man,
[SPEAKER_03]: Durbin style.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have infinity cannabis,
you can play like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's the gift when you do farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the gift you get is, is this gift
of being able to play with flowers like
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody else does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can, you know, and then once
you start breeding, it's really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: because then you, you take this,
this mama and this daddy, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you sprinkle them on her and you,
you know, all of a sudden you have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these children that start throwing these
different profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it really gets interesting
because then, and then when you can sift
[SPEAKER_02]: through that one mother and then find some
children from her that now you're onto
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take that kid and you mix it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mix it with, this is shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, that's the future of
cannabis because we really don't know how
[SPEAKER_02]: these certain terpene profiles work with
individuals' bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're finding with all
these illnesses.
[SPEAKER_11]: The minor ones that we're pulling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These cannabinoid effects on, on these,
you know, for instance, with the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Charlotte's web, like they're,
you know, and so many patients that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're finding like, Oh, this works for
them, but this doesn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so now we have this, this field to
work with where we can start really mixing
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different cannabinoid profiles,
terpene profiles, flavonoid, whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: works.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden you start doing that and
then you start mixing them into flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also to where, whether it's you're smoking
it or you're blending it up in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a shake, which is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're really supposed to do
is you put them in these fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: these smoothies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get on the level, you know,
and you're not even, you're, you get to a
[SPEAKER_02]: point to where you're so homostasis that
you don't even need to smoke because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, you're just, you can deal with
everything because you're just in tune
[SPEAKER_02]: because your whole body's like through the
gut and all that, you know, rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoking is cool, but we need to really
figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we really need to evolve from
that into in these different tinctures
[SPEAKER_02]: that we take.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you have tinctures here?
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some, a project that I'm helping
working out, working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a line of THC free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, this is just trying to work
within the regulations of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and for me, it, you're finding
that a lot of people want to go to THC
[SPEAKER_02]: free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what this line is.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's mostly, but, but, but even if,
if there's, but even if they're not
[SPEAKER_11]: getting high, don't you want some THC in
there?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're, you're free.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, what the plant's doing is taking
the iron and it's making CBDs and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: taking magnesium and it's making THC and,
and, and whatever, you know, when we take
[SPEAKER_02]: that, so we see there's so much we don't
know, but when we take that CBD and when
[SPEAKER_02]: we take that THC, we're taking essentially
the plant's iron and the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium, what she did with it or he did,
you know, that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you take that into the gut,
we really don't know what reaction is the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones doing to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're finding out they both play on
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very important to have them both,
you know, flowing through the bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we really don't know if, if we have a
bunch of THC, is that going to cancel out
[SPEAKER_02]: the CB1 receptor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if we have too much CBD, is that going
to cancel out the CB2 or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know the science.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't technically interact with
either of those receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CBD does, and it just blocks the THC
from going all the way into them because
[SPEAKER_03]: it hits all the receptors mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens if you build up too much
of one or the other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of where, you know,
so this is, yeah, this is, this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, no, this is full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So full spectrum 0.3.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hem full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hem full spectrum means so little now it
stinks.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to work with what we have these
distillates though, and they're pulling it
[SPEAKER_03]: apart.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a low THC plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an infusion then?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not, I mean, if it's an
extraction, it can't really be full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to try it?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, is this a, oh, this is a gummy?
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the gummies.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the tincture and this is the rope.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the beauty of this is that you can
send it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have to be THC free.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just has to be below 0.3.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, there's a lot of moms and there's
a lot of parents and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people out there that don't want to fuck
with THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Told it's the devil's lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so it's important to have
products out there that people can go to
[SPEAKER_02]: and start baby steps and then get
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do CBDA and THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's no CBD or THC in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been told for 70 years and
it's terrible for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to take the gummies and trip
and you'll never, you know, come back to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's something that you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get that full body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the flower, you know, this is flower
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is the CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's, so there's no cherry wine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had some, it was like 11 to 2.
[SPEAKER_11]: CBD, the THC was at a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually it was one out of the ones out in
the desert.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't get me high, but it was all my
attention away.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the clarity that it created almost
made me feel high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you're supposed to feel it
balances.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where he got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's stuff in camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't even cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are growing that too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm doing eight acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight acres of this year orchard style,
just big trees and not, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: eight acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And put love into it to where,
you know, you're yielding at least four
[SPEAKER_02]: units on top of whatever you're harvesting
from root up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be using stock,
you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then use it for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we like to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole plant.
Whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now is there THC in here or do you have to
remove it from here?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's zero.
[SPEAKER_13]: Zero point three.
[SPEAKER_11]: Zero point three.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the plant produces it, you know,
it's impossible to get it to not produce
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem everybody's having.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because there's so much shit testing
hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are having the trouble with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now is everything's testing hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're killing the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you raise it to one percent,
it would save most of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they're going to go to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, three and a half.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go for four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four, five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put thresholds up on,
okay, anything above 16, you got to be 18
[SPEAKER_02]: above or nine to 20 years old,
buy it, whatever, anything below,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you should be able to get fucked
just like Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't want them to start doing the
graduated taxation based on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know, but it's just based on
content based on THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing is you can already see
how they're setting it up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a patient or you have tolerance,
they're just, it's just no already 39
[SPEAKER_11]: percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've told them, I mean, the most powerful
constituency potentially, of course,
[SPEAKER_11]: is the Canada's consumer.
[SPEAKER_11]: If they realize it, but it's not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're a patient, if you're like a
legitimate patient, you can pay those
[SPEAKER_11]: level of taxes.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Legitimate.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's legitimate, though?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my definition is is loose.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's rather wide definition.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, well, if if you you would use
it, if you go home and you have,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, whatever, you know, to after
work and you're going to smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_11]: rather than, you know, your wife.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_09]: Among other things one could do when one
doesn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of almost medicinal
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you just use it to maintain
homostasis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, sort of like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I probably shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I drink too much, I'll get rowdy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Challenge accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be be clear minded.
[SPEAKER_11]: So did you ever go to the Cannabis Cup
when it was out there?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the the Hustlers Cup in San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking that racket.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Hustlers Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what was it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the High Times Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: The High Times Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go to the High Times Cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's like he should do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he gets high.
[SPEAKER_11]: He gets together with his celebrity
friends in Malibu, you know, like Bill
[SPEAKER_11]: Moore and that group.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he will use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you talk to him, you probably tell you,
yeah, I've been using that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm still fucking alive.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like campers and stuff like that in
the rugs and like add that stuff in to
[SPEAKER_07]: like make it so you get that initial CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: This product's going to be mostly
equestrian, but eventually it'd like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's where it kind of started out
with horses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, it's actually a friend of
mine, a lady friend's product.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the pet lion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you could take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gummies and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot my bandages.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going through the.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this your client?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: So this for pet and humans and human.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, what's this one for?
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that's that's the tangy girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: People spend more money on their animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangy, tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an Amherst diesel right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one do you like?
[SPEAKER_13]: The first one or the second one?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take I'll take a lead on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're doing is this like helping get them
calm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's got all those other
benefits.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, get you calm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with two, we want to lay that out for
him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here you want it for your dog.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I give him these little these
little biscuits that are to Rick and slow
[SPEAKER_00]: low dose of CBD, like two milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear to God, you like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make a tincture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, T.H.C.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: is 20 times more inflammatory than an
Advil is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll get you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of eating a handful of Advil,
have an Advil system.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I like animals and us have an
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have an Advil system.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of one liners like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Better for being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden they fire on the
Advil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but they're not going to tell us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was right next to the Xanax system and
the ambient system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: The T.H.C.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: was great for that inflammation for the
older animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a great work for the CBD was
great for the anxiety and the stress that
[SPEAKER_03]: came along with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we made a one to one with the
high C.B.D.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: and the high T.H.C.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: in the same one because very few people
have anxiety, not pain, pain, but anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everyone's bodies are so
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get an internship in your
laboratory?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every vet should take a class.
[SPEAKER_03]: People spend more money on their animal's
health care in California than they do on
[SPEAKER_11]: their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom's dogs watched the fireworks in
Massachusetts for the first time in eight
[SPEAKER_03]: years this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, what the fuck did you do to my
dogs?
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you do to my dogs?
[SPEAKER_11]: For the fireworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one or two drops per 15 pounds
animal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do an olive oil based tincture similar
to what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just ground the cannabis up,
infuse it into olive oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we grow ACDC and just ground it up into
olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coconut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coconut's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a honey and I put it in my tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the gut is how you're supposed to
be doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take it through your belly button.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called pechote.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be a lifeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go through your belly button.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll absorb in through there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're trying to focus it to where
you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you eat it, it has to go
through your stomach acid, your liver,
[SPEAKER_03]: your kidneys to get to there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You supository or put it in your belly
button.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, it's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you tell them how you made that?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rolled it like a Cuban.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's all part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's full.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only a handful are made.
[SPEAKER_02]: All from the same plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cool... It's a fun... It makes the
harvest season that much special because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's from 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a piece of history from that
harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, it's special.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like it's a blunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually use the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: One day I'll see it as wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The artisan... I'll sit down with somebody
like Snoop or whoever and go over this and
[SPEAKER_02]: then all of a sudden that fucking thing
will be worth a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a glass case, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that year especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: That year and that terpene profile and
cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a Durban tasting the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2017, 2018 and 2019 next to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I used to do it with wine all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have verticals on our list.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd never done it with verticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are Tuwaras going to play in this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the end, that will be what will
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: To where these people in ten years,
there'll be these farms that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the way the fucking sun hits it in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like up in Sonoma when the whole
thing went down in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, how do we figure it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why doesn't this property play and this
property does?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all the little secrets.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking that your area may be
actually a more appropriate area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science wise, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: To certain genetics, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I've never heard anyone say really
Sonoma or any of those areas are really
[SPEAKER_11]: like, there's more like political reasons
why people settle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, they got out of the fucking
city and you went up there because you can
[SPEAKER_02]: hide in the redwoods and you can hide in
the hills up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're open.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out in the open.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no hiding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of red shank you can
get under that if you're lucky,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's 16 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does anyone get away with anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: He used the rosin from the plant to
squeeze together the fresh leaves and then
[SPEAKER_03]: cured it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, over time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've learned though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put it there, put it there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hide it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're safe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you think about it, it's
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those ABAs are going to be important for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because we were involved in the NorCal
grow off and it's so amazing to get 70
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators got two clippings off the same
plant and then grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do one of those this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're to where we take same thing to give,
you know, a bunch of cuts off one deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do boom boom and see who goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at a picture of the 38 buds that
were submitted and if you told somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: there were 38 different buds, you'd have
believed them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: But up there, because of elevation,
it plays a big role.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where ever you're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wind and the soil and indoor and
outdoor with light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why in the end, you know,
when when you do encompass the outdoor to
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor in the markets, you know,
eventually California's got to realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's got to take advantage of its
outdoor market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, there's a couple of
different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's some stratas,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but yeah, the light's key.
[SPEAKER_02]: That light's key.
[SPEAKER_02]: That same light cycle, you know,
being on the parallels like that's key.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and to the biosphere like the
Mediterranean kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: biosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, it's been getting fucking cold
in California right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's averaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say 38 up north.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 40 last week when I was up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been chilly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's but it doesn't really
ever get below 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get a deep freeze for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get several storms every year to where
I'll get at least especially last few
[SPEAKER_02]: years to where, you know, I'll get five
inches, you know, last a day or two and
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right on that layer to where you're
not shoveling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just do a full term.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So do most people in your area do what you
do?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in it for the money,
you're going to do it for as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to do it as quick as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to do it from clones and
you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're not going to care how
you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottom line is how much am I going to
make?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you do it and you got love
and you put into it and then it's
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a process called the
marathon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're not doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the money's great because we all got
to pay bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all got to feed ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's why you're doing it,
you're going to lose in this business,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because this is culture in the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this so many people are coming
into it right now and like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, it's new.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is new business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are we going to do the regulation?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that this business has been around for
decades, centuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do all the regulation you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are still going to do what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put all.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the problem is you get
companies that come in and think I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get the first license and I'm going to
monopolize this area and I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy, you know, fuck everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Canopy Group and I got four fucking
billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just going to come in and we're
going to monopolize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to umbrella you guys and we're
going to buy up everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to buy up all the licenses and
we're going to monopolize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not going to fucking monopolize
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what they tried to do in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to monopolize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the whole petrochemical industry
monopolize this plant and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, you can't use this plant because our
patents are inferior to this plant and we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't make the billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're insecure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck, you know, insecure about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and you had the A.M.A.,
the head dude of the M.A.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: go in front of Congress and say,
what the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: For one, if you weren't calling it
marijuana, the farmers would be out here
[SPEAKER_02]: with their pitchforks and hang you
cocksuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse my language.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, and they pulled the wool
over everyone's eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're rolling out all this new
shit like, you know, and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why Canopy lose four billion dollars?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're idiots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went into this and they thought,
oh, we're going to, you know, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Medmen lose 64 billion or million,
you know, or whatever they fucking lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows how much money that's like
quarterly doing the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of those conversations
because they're trying to monopolize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't monopolize in the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's and this is it's agriculture,
but it's also culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not beer and it's not
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to come into this and
treat it like beer and cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking making people stupid and dying,
killing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to heal people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a Budweiser system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with the cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those things are causing people
to not be conscious and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just run around like, you know,
idiots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're coming in like,
we got a bunch of money and we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a whole new business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how are we going to regulate this
all new?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, it ain't fucking new.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in where you fit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to keep losing money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in my area, they got there with
fucking Blackhawks, Blackhawks flying
[SPEAKER_02]: around on these poor Asian people that are
probably already culture shocked is
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, they were shipped over
here and screwed up war and a screwed up
[SPEAKER_02]: deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just trying to put food on the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have access because nobody
cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, they're the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sad deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you really want to talk about
it, they're now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're now and they're every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're looking down on that
area, how we're going to.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're DEA, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's all types.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's DEA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably it's within a hundred miles
of the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's whoever it wants to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild West out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are like, we just want to grow
our weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we just want a fair chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of us alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're going to people,
you know, you've got Coachella to where,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, we'll pay all kinds of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 20 plus, probably, at least over two
dozen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Twenty five.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you want to join a member's club for
smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how would be that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was up in Galletta the other day and
they had one up north of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a smoking club like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I might as well have a beer since
you got me started.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you been to the cafe that opened?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Bondi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it fun?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to go when you don't have to wait on
line.
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just opened up a back section.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Lowe's anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the same spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can get you can drink beer and
wine there now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this you, the High Country Growers
Association?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is the High Country.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_13]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jesse, I'm Kevin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pleasure to meet you, Kev.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a piece of art.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I used I worked on a show called
Long After.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was on there with the beer,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Pritchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a feature with that same kind
of method of rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I got it from that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long does it take to roll one like
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks like that's to roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 15 minutes, 10 minutes,
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends how fucked up that's already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got your nerds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Packers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I had nerds for lunch yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been we've been trying to give those
away for how many years or like a year or
[SPEAKER_09]: two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're part of the club now.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had whoever makes nerds as a client
and they who ever makes nerd ships like a
[SPEAKER_09]: pallet of nerds candy here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so every time we have a party,
we just put it out to, like, hope people
[SPEAKER_09]: take it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it home.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great that that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's still a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why there was fucking so many nerds here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking team crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, nerd rope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd rope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like to chop up a snort of fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can eat all the nerds you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before you discovered cocaine,
did you discover all the nerds you want?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I graduated to cocaine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can take all the poison you want,
but try to make something organic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: My parents like my kids.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you want to make something good for
people?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I just grow plants and put it in
oil.
That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not happy about that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they got to figure something out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when are you going to plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping to go have everything done by
end of March.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too cold now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're too small.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting stuff on popping seeds right
now, and I'm hoping to have everything in
[SPEAKER_08]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you could do any time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked to what side.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're growing in smart spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not not the hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing the rose, doing the rose and doing
them orchard style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the hemp is from seed also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, do you have the wicked?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm doing them wicked straight like
the vineyards.
[SPEAKER_07]: But but hemp can grow a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm hoping I get a taproot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were talking about the dry
farming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get an eight, six to eight foot
taproot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tree trunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's not that fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a human.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: About six feet apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six feet with about eight foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all machine, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a lot of hand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a quarter acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what a lot of people are just
doing, you know, straight, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: three foot plants, you know, real bunched
up and trying to fit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: three, four thousand plants into an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about a pimp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they're doing in Camarillo.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all like they're all flowering and
they're like four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your biggest one.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_09]: They might be getting are they getting two
turns?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, they're just they're putting
them out there at veg at maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a foot and a half, two feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're getting another you know,
maybe a month of veg out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going into flower at four
feet and they're getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds a pound, pound and a half,
if they're lucky on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see is three to four pounds a
flower, you know, eight pounds of biomass
[SPEAKER_02]: talking trunk and root and the whole this
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a hemp seed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut down using you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're not using as many plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not using as much water to keep so
many plants going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a benefit in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's you want to have a
personal touch on things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what the best vineyards
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys are walking up and down the
vineyards plant every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you choose your hemp?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what to grow?
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, really, to be honest with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a whole new area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you grow the wrong stuff and it
turns out hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens and this is something that,
you know, we're in the new territory of
[SPEAKER_02]: what genetics work in your what cultivars
work in your area.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's hot mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Over point three percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a fine line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're saying is if you get up to
one or two percent, which you're shooting
[SPEAKER_03]: for, then all of a sudden things that were
judged over point three are still legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you try to say you'll go right up to
the line and someone goes, yes,
[SPEAKER_11]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say way below that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said TAC free.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he meant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand the beginning what you
were saying, but I get it now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can play with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's yours.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And have some fun with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I enjoy teas, doing teas out of
it, just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you go buy the bags and you just
stuff a couple grams of that into the tea,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever tea you're having at night or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just loving life.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do rolls with those, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can roll.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll one up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to roll one up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll roll one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a full on smoker and you're
trying to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this will do now, if we smoke this,
is it will make us from this high to this
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes you from being too high to
less high, but for a longer duration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because CBD stops this THC even going all
the way into the C1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of being this high,
you're this high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a way actually more functional
feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that this is uncomfortable,
but for a lot of people, like at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald Cups and other things like that,
when people get too high, a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: drops of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's if you would just started
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's why the couches are close by.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two moms over there are like,
oh, yeah, three dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a couple of drops of the high CBD oil
bring you right the fuck out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People go from trying to call the hospital
to taking a deep breath and being OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to mix it with a high sativa style,
like I said, so you can get all the,
[SPEAKER_03]: because this is great for, like you said,
focus and concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if you were driving and you
need to pay attention, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, like later.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it blocks the THC from going all the
way into the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so it just blocks the receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blocks the cannabinoids from going into
the receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it blocks the receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it blocks the cannabinoids from
going to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it blocks the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: What if they've already gotten to the
receptor?
[SPEAKER_03]: That does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It pulls it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stops it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's why you're too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: From behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this is quite the tool you've got
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the tool, the tools now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that his client came up here and
was like, I want whatever you're all
[SPEAKER_09]: having.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydro farms, man, a lot of money off
those.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got any cardboard?
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper plate of some sort?
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper roll?
[SPEAKER_13]: Toilet paper roll?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I work with family.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have hemp farms in Wisconsin.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we started out with extract lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we started out doing CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he started doing that a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he got his PhD in analytical chemistry
in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he's been doing extraction ever
since.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's old school.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so he started doing like,
it was all going on in Canada way before
[SPEAKER_07]: what was happening here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's doing it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put a lot of other people in
business doing that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's interesting to talk to you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like learning all about the different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's so many out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you were talking about earlier is
like, everyone's learning about how
[SPEAKER_07]: different cannabinoids can affect
different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're still learning about which
there's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're still learning about what's
going to help one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because one thing helps one thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's why the pharmaceutical Bayer is
already in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: They own all the patents.
[SPEAKER_11]: All those guys own all the patents.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why the patents, the things
that are staying away from small farmers
[SPEAKER_11]: are now starting to patent their genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the problem I'm having with
local government and stuff is a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, and along with California,
they're missing out on this opportunity of
[SPEAKER_02]: these small farms getting these patents
and these Appalachians that decree.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the lawyers are there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people were holding onto them.
[SPEAKER_11]: But even with Appalachians, at some point,
no matter what protection you get,
[SPEAKER_11]: you have to protect it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to go out there and protect it.
[SPEAKER_11]: At some point or other.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't have that gateway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And companies like Bayer and, you know,
do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: But smaller operations are starting to
realize that ultimately that's their only
[SPEAKER_11]: route to protection.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the key to my survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key to my survival is nobody
else can do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody else can do what I can do on my
land.
[SPEAKER_11]: No one else can say that they're growing
with your Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_02]: This certain cultivar that this only these
seeds that were genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what I was trying to get out
earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: So champagne is like, and when you go to
the.
[SPEAKER_11]: Champagne got raped.
[SPEAKER_11]: They got raped and they lost control.
[SPEAKER_11]: Time after time after time after time.
[SPEAKER_11]: They lost control in the ports of their
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's too late.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no putting the asshole back in the
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a learning point.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a learning curve for people who want
Appalachians, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally a learning spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Appalachian is part of the key
to the Appalachian, the cultivar,
[SPEAKER_02]: the farm, the farmer, you know,
and, you know, anybody can kind of be the
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer once that technique is taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody can be the land and nothing can
be the cultivar except for that genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you hold on to that bear can't
duplicate that, you know, bear can want to
[SPEAKER_02]: duplicate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of companies can try and get
pretty close to duplicating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, if you do it right and
that Appalachians protected, then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, numbers go a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so if you got enough people
behind you, you know, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: in the end, that's what's going to protect
the small farmer is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: being in the right area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the people that aren't in the
right area, you know, and want a future in
[SPEAKER_02]: farming probably aren't going to have one.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the thing about Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just the soil and it's not just
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the history of the region.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the technique.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all of those little nuances.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is the grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's like a part of all of
those that mix that you guys all had to
[SPEAKER_09]: use the same technique, because I feel
like with champagne, don't they all have
[SPEAKER_09]: to do the same technique?
[SPEAKER_09]: And all like do things at the exact same
time as each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's more important into the
terroir, like, you know, guaranteeing is a
[SPEAKER_02]: product that is consistent, you know,
and so you're getting when you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: a certain cheese or you're getting a
certain wine or certain, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it may be, you know, tequila,
that glob becomes that grows in tequila a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain way, you know, and so you're
getting a certain guaranteed of a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what's important about
establishing Appalachians and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: establishing the cultivar also along with
it, you know, and what's going to thrive
[SPEAKER_02]: there for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the practices, you know,
standards of what what cultivars are on
[SPEAKER_09]: the table for where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think, you know, heavy Indica's
are are going to be the dominant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was stuff that stuff that
works with that parallel in time and in
[SPEAKER_02]: history, you know, and not trying to
reinvent the wheel, go, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: working with what what is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that, you know, heavy Indica's
are what's going to thrive there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then from there is a matter
of figuring out what works best there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Will there be better years for cannabis,
just like with the grapes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, definitely, definitely,
definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be like we were
talking earlier about doing the cigars,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, you know, having us, you know,
something that's that time capsule from
[SPEAKER_02]: that farm and that, you know, that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you made one, let's say you had made
50 of these and they were marked as coming
[SPEAKER_11]: from 2024 and they were made a certain way
over time, they would have value.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if enough people smoked it to where
they're like, that fucking thing was a
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamite.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's worth a mouth value.
[SPEAKER_11]: But but the value would be earned.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they would have it would have value.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd also appreciate aging cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's also might be the type of thing
that would increase in value, just like
[SPEAKER_11]: just like the template.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would peak at some point like wine,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like red wine, if you get too late.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it just changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cigars change.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can keep a cigar in a humidor
for a long time, a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But tobacco doesn't degrade from THCA to
THC to Delta A to CBN.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're changing cannabinoids over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tobacco just turns into less tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you create the Temple Bowl and
French eat cannoli.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even if you're keeping it like
temperature wise, humidity wise,
[SPEAKER_07]: is it still time still decarbs?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time, heat and pressure slow it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he said they improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Temple Balls, you know,
I like to use the human as a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's some character there,
but the the health of the product isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: quite there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yes, there's a lot of character
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's something that you're smoking,
possibly it could be a different effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a different, you know,
because it's expression, spiritual,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, just being, you know,
whatever it may be for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think as a product, as you know,
it loses its whole by it peeks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets to a point to where it so it won't
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did the three different Durban's the
other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 2019 was this bright, you know,
vibrant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 2018 was a more like full body
complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 2017, you could tell, had aged,
didn't quite have the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't quite have the flavor coming
through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the nuances of the 2017 were really
neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't our favorite one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you got to smoke the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone likes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People keep looking for fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh isn't always better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's got to age into things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the friggin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this stuff's got to come out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like not everyone cures their cannabis
properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's one people rush it to
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's really nice to see how kind
of his ages and right for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have we haven't been a part of
that process ever before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really neat to finally see that
was early because I said in one had that
[SPEAKER_03]: verticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to go back to that 2017 and be
able to, you know, say, oh, wow,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is this difference in 2017 be kept
in a human or no, we had no, it's just in
[SPEAKER_03]: jars, just, you know, but it had been in
jar for three years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you still we open it up and
the terpenes are still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can definitely tell it's Durbin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it wasn't quite as poppy as the
2018 to 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but it oxidized a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was a little less color
into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing about the temple balls was
the coating gets hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: So inside traps is preserved.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't make the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's so they can travel with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's about that when you
manipulate that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it degrades in a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that need to be explored more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they start letting us study that,
you know, and you can start studying the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual terpenes and cannabinoids and
shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the reason I was asking was
because, you know, so he works with
[SPEAKER_11]: aficionado and so and so does.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now actually has his own stuff on the
market.
[SPEAKER_11]: So would we would we see one day like like
that?
[SPEAKER_11]: My father's 18 year old.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're more likely as he aged hashed and
you are aged cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was the age cannabis for what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, we go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like wine, some wines have 20 year
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some wines only have a five year life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of your wines have a two year life.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's different because they
degrade past their time.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it might be that you grew something
where one season it was like
[SPEAKER_11]: exceptionally.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like that now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always been like that when something
is exceptional.
[SPEAKER_11]: And whenever it hit the L.A.
[SPEAKER_11]: County line, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because people knew, you know,
so and so it was gone fast, but the met
[SPEAKER_11]: your memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny the parallels between campus
and wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I get talking about just seems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's what's just the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two where there's a lot of parallels,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But two kind of two different worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one's pre-annual and one's the
annual and the cycles are a lot different.
And.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely for culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them together.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you get on that next level is
when you start mixing those two just at
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis cafe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bathroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a back porch where you can get
food, have wine and beer now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can go inside, smoke and eat
inside.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a door, but you can't smoke
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't drink inside.
What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, we had an appetizer and a glass of
wine came inside and had dinner and
[SPEAKER_03]: dessert and smoked all the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: Few more years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, once it feels right to be in this
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, there should be at
least that option to work.
[SPEAKER_11]: But also that was that was the great thing
about the Emerald Exchange is being able
[SPEAKER_11]: to go up and see all these different
farmers and their product at the same
[SPEAKER_11]: place.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like a kid in a candy shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Emerald Exchange is my first my first
big event, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never forget it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you want to see their harvest,
you know, and you want, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's culture and it's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a different culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: The desert growing culture is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole problem right now with
the two different worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of the northern those
farms up there look down here and don't
[SPEAKER_02]: respect the farms down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's something good
going down down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we all got to work together
and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand California's Tawara as a whole
needs to be protected, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have a really good story to
tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of us do up there,
you know, a lot of the farmers in SoCal
[SPEAKER_02]: and NorCal in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is the legal market down here,
you're not allowed to grow outdoor flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only get indoor licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it hinders that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's part of the problem
between NorCal and SoCal is that they
[SPEAKER_03]: believe in the sun in NorCal and they want
in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not allowed to use the sun like
they should be able to down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not necessarily anyone's fault
except for the lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the money's fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's creating that dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many greedy people look at it like,
oh, we're going to make money here and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're going to do it our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't look at how just let things be
and let let it be agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: let the plant thrive where she thrives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about hemp?
[SPEAKER_11]: You can grow legally outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: All hemp is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a word, dramatic word for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so when you use hemp,
it's like, what about hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hemp needs to be farmed in a
responsible manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's not lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been, you know, it's just all of
a sudden it's been turned into this
[SPEAKER_02]: monocrop where let's fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can do 100 acres, 900 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can do, oh, look at me, I can fucking
do a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are you doing a thousand
of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bio-redeem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're cleaning the soil, you're
cleaning the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, you know, as a product,
you know, to market, don't worry about the
[SPEAKER_02]: mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to press it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to fucking juice it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not, I mean, I'm not trying to
hate on that, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's just ease into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do as much as we can,
but responsibly, you know, and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is there's a lot, a lot of people
losing their ass right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the hemp industry, you know,
that jumped into it thinking they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to make a lot of money and a lot of
promises.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not if you were somebody that got into
some stock and got out, quit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: knew the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're a farmer and you
thought, oh, wow, this is what's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: finally bail me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made all those investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it didn't bail you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're thinking what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's so many people coming
into this game 20 years too late,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for that money that isn't there
anymore, you know, and that's the sad
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is a lot of people are losing their
ass in this industry and they don't need
[SPEAKER_02]: to because it isn't all what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's agriculture, you know, and you got
all this new inventions of lights and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, if I'm on the East Coast
and I can't use the God given sun,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I'm trying to make some
specific medicine strain that just needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, that I want to do in a
controlled environment and I don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't disbelieve in passive solar,
like greenhouses, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's certain passive solar greenhouses
that are regenerative and you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: sucking off the grid are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but yeah, they're basic
greenhouse, you know, but you're using the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun in a way that, you know, you're not
normal greenhouse control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a lot more control.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have control because of the
pests and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the thing I've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding, I've learned to be able to breed
certain genetics that work and that don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, I get a certain amount of pests in
this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's, let's get a little more
limonene in there, you know, or the
[SPEAKER_02]: eucalyptus, you know, there's certain
turps that you can get into the plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't, that are pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the shit that people don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm growing this shit here and I
don't, and they're wondering why they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting infestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because you're attracting it,
you know, and whatever cultivar is
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once people start learning,
oh, I put this here, then that's when shit
[SPEAKER_02]: starts clicking, you know, and the real ad
comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: See people are trying to use the old 20
year model of hiding it indoors when it
[SPEAKER_02]: was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the regs going to,
okay, now we need to put it indoors cause
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to control it because it's
marijuana and you know, like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like you got, there's
superstructures being built in Coachella
[SPEAKER_02]: and out and out of Lanto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, literally like fucking warehouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these places are, oh my God,
the carbon footprint they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if they're, they're making
their own energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just going to be just in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just being there and what they're
going to create a few jobs, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: put that in an area to where the plant
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if those people really truly love
being in the industry, they'll move there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and they'll know that's what
they'll do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like in the grape industry,
you know, or the avocados or oranges.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like you don't use a lot of
power.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it in my budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I use as less power, you know,
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when the TV's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't try to, you know, that just
doesn't make sense for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I'm trying to veg,
I'll do a little bit, but I try to stay
[SPEAKER_02]: aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to use as much sun as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting that full spectrum of UVs that
the plant knows that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not getting, you know, robbed of
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the future is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all going to get cannabis,
but it's going to be some fucked up
[SPEAKER_02]: monster strain of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all, you know, we're all going to
get our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fucking guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll sell you to death on those fucking
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they going to do now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting all that shit from China.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what the fuck you going to do on that
whole deal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you want to get in that fucking deal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to cause a ruckus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a shit show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody even knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next train wreck events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to get packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you want a system that's so
reliant, you know, you're reliant on the
[SPEAKER_02]: grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have an outage, all of a sudden
your shit goes into, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it's long as the power in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have places, it takes them two
years to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well look at like fuck some of the
projects into the Coachella.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not even fucking on for,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even have power yet and they're
still getting bled by the County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you gotta love California.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not on a proper like micro grid or
something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's the thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got evacuated in October.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Southern Edison guy we talked to say
it's like a two year wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a first come first serve thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like if you're- First come first serve.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's also like, there's a line and
these people- Lots of lines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this guy was responsible for
bringing the power to the desert.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of power down in fucking
desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got windmills generating power.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out of the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does it count for you,
baby?
[SPEAKER_02]: And literally, you'll get your power.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow a marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a special kind of power.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to send you magical power and
that costs more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's work with some of
those guys that have been going through
[SPEAKER_02]: that whole deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, talking about fucking people
have been over backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people had high hopes down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's finally reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you don't push something
that's not natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those type of deals are going to work in
the Midwest and on the East Coast where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's super cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, you can't grow much and there's
still a supply there and a huge demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you got this little warehouse that
can supply enough that it's going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: a good mint and it can keep the power on,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But here, I don't see the shit like down
on the desert working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see- That's all the more reason
why we need to be able to ship cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: across state lines because they're not
trying to grow avocados over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not trying to grow spinach over
there because it doesn't grow well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't grow well over there.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow where it grows the best and you
ship it to the right rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how farming works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for some reason, that loop has been
cut off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get it back right now,
but certainly we should be able to ship
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit to the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never going to stop that part of it
until you, you know, I hate to say it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know if the current person in
office right now, he kind of sees it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sees that, oh, you know, they're going
to get it regardless.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're going to get addiction
is going to be out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get their product
regardless and prohibition doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, regardless on his emotion,
if he thinks you may, you may sound stupid
[SPEAKER_02]: or it makes you sound stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if, you know, whatever his thoughts on
what it does to an individual,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes down to a business sense and
California is making a lot of money on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and all California really is,
is a renter in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: rent in one of the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So venture capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually the feds coming for its money,
you know, and Oregon's money and
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington's money and Colorado's money,
you know, eventually that's how it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we're doing this is they're
getting their dry run on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying, well, how's this working?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening with the farmers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's fucking California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those cocksuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sitting on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Problem is there's no money in health and
that's what's being held back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's no money in health.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start teaching the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: People get healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no money in education or health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if you don't get the reason they
make money is cause you get sick and they
[SPEAKER_03]: give you pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't get sick and they can't give
you pills, it changes medicine back to
[SPEAKER_03]: before the thirties when that's how it was
plant-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that changes the face of medicine
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for people that make a lot of money
who run the government, that's holding it
[SPEAKER_03]: back right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so even if the big, you know,
does understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big pharma is big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's petrochemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's talking plastic, textile,
fucking fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking everything on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the plant is going to change the
world eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, eventually people will wake up
to this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and it cleans the environment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why didn't someone tell us?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it cleans the water.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we got all this chemical in the water
and it cleans the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually this shit will click with
people and, you know, it's just going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know, we move at plant speed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fast as light, slow as time.
[SPEAKER_11]: See, Musk had a perfect example because he
uses him in the Tesla cars, but then he
[SPEAKER_11]: gets reamed for smoking a joint on the Joe
Rogan show.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he has to apologize because Wall Street
comes after him.
[SPEAKER_11]: But he could have said, hey, you
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I smoked the joint, but look what I
fucking do with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't so much to smoke the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he said after he smoked the joint,
now my stock's going to sell for $420.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was that common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Henry Ford was building cars way
before Tesla was.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_11]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying he was the first to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He should have been like, yeah,
I smoke weed, and then I create billions
and shareholder values.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ford was building form panels,
the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we should have been all the
engines.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was also, you know, killing the
workers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tesla stock price has gone up,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hasn't Tesla stock price gone up over the
past week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I fucking skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My theory is, is because a lot of their
stuff's in-house and this whole China
[SPEAKER_02]: thing's going to fuck the car industry
because everything, you know, you want a
[SPEAKER_02]: pair of brakes, it's going to be made in
China.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do a lot of shit up there in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're up there where they're fucking
NorCal there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's NorCal people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole nother state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should just separate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you want to separate California?
No.
[SPEAKER_11]: South will rise again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, that factory does everything
in-house for the most part.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or he invented some rocket that's going to
the moon and the fucking world's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: end real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a ticket to the moon.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's ultimate vertical integrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a pretty sharp dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He puts it as it is, you know,
common sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks at, you know, like, fuck you
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This AI thing's going to get out of
control.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pay attention here real quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's like, oh, what are they
talking about?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, he's so smart.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's already out of control.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that was bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, I think about shit that
comes up in my feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's half of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even, that's the part to let me
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you want to buy this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're just trying to sell you
something.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's for your own safety.
[SPEAKER_12]: You wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanted safety over freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your safety.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a changing world.
[SPEAKER_11]: High country growers association.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: 10.
[SPEAKER_09]: Straight up?
[SPEAKER_09]: It is 10.
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell me about the logical regulations
that are being put in place in Riverside
[SPEAKER_09]: County.
[SPEAKER_09]: Logical?
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no logical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They threw away, they threw, we had an ad
hoc.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an ad hoc, which is you know,
two real like minded people come together
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, hash out what should have
been, you know, talked about and they
[SPEAKER_02]: expunged that and said, oh, I'll kick that
to the curb.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you have to deal with everything at
the county level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's unincorporated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either either they incorporate over
there in Anza or they keep getting screwed
[SPEAKER_02]: by the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is that, you know,
a little valley up there sits on some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most best, most pristine water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the watershed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what water sheds from there,
if it's shitty contaminated water,
[SPEAKER_02]: that shitty contaminated water sheds down
into the Valley Temecula, Elsinore,
[SPEAKER_02]: Corona, Hammett, Menefee, countless down,
eventually down to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ain't guys, I'm pulling your water
from up North out of fucking Mono.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's that other little, where are we
currently pulling our water from in LA?
[SPEAKER_09]: Charlie, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like probably should know this waffle
between Ralph's and the faucet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither here is going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pipeline that comes down from this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a movie done on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: China Lake in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it pulled it all the way from
Mammoth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know where Mammoth is above
Mammoth above June Lake up there from Mono
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much even further, you know,
from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes all the way down from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into the Owens Valley from the Owens
Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even a pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a square fucking thing that they just
carved out of the hills back when,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a water company actually like
right there before Mammoth in between LA
[SPEAKER_07]: and right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's right off the freeway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, OK, these guys are bottling
water coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Christ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's Crystal Gleiser.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got pop for putting that right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got pop for putting because it was
tap water.
[SPEAKER_07]: For them, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, they got pop for putting some
fat in their water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got they just got pop recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arshnik.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangerine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arshnik.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's still good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arshnik.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Arshnik.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they got pop for Arshnik.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that occur naturally, though,
in that stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it doesn't actually occur in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way the news was, the wonderful media
pitch did, is that these guys knew they
[SPEAKER_02]: were putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew it was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it can occur right naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that rodent and Arshnik.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is key for people, you know,
and that's a watershed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one thing that people should
realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there still land for sale in this
valley?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's still land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to invest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to invest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom could be your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, you want to come on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom, you could turn into the next Swami.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could grow a big beard.
[SPEAKER_11]: The desert Swami.
[SPEAKER_11]: The desert Swami.
[SPEAKER_11]: High country, high country Swami.
[SPEAKER_02]: High country Swami.
[SPEAKER_11]: The American Taliban.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't he also a Jew from New York?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The swamp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulation needs to change because the
Appalachian, you know, if we're in
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere down in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, but did you say what the current
regulations are?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't allow for all throughout
the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not allow any outdoor
cultivation except for your 6 or your 24.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if it's only indoor, then you guys
can't create the basis for Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't create the framework for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you lose what could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to tell these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at me like I'm crazy.
Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, there's grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole development of Temecula.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temecula has all types of Appalachians
that are through the AVN or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you make those arguments to them,
what do they got?
[SPEAKER_02]: The American Veniculture ABA.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck they call it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Other people living in the state could say
no Appalachians are real.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis Appalachians are real.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll just let up north do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right after you guys are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, science.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll throw the science up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Science, science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Us two.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want the social equity,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We deserve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's why I came down and
visit with Cedar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have many.
[SPEAKER_11]: Laos, Laos, Laos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friends are new neighbors,
so we got to get used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They own property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they started migrating in about
five years ago heavily and now bought a
[SPEAKER_02]: good portion of the Appalachian and
they're there to stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they grow good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem is they don't know what
good cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're all they get their hands
on some clones and they're spraying the
[SPEAKER_02]: shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's getting all the neighbors
driving in nice cars and trucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, every year and it's driving
the hillbilly people crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The country folk crazy out there,
you know, people who've been there for a
[SPEAKER_11]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andzoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Country folk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all country folk out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so these country people are
like, who are these people?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming in and they're raiding,
you know, like and so, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then eventually, you know,
what happened was is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the big money finally came in last couple
of years, and that's who got the sheriff's
[SPEAKER_02]: rob up and all that everybody else rather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, we're investing in this
fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys better come out and crack down
on these fuckers, black market
[SPEAKER_07]: motherfuckers, you know, the farming
community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, kind of sticks together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for now, you have this whole new
culture here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, these people look different,
but people got to like understand there's
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still farmers and they're hard
workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a sense of community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they're older.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and they don't like that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes it bad for the growers,
though, also, because now you have that
[SPEAKER_02]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, oh, you're, you know,
rather than looking upon, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're bringing like back in the early
70s, 80s, 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quiet money, but it was the money
that kept the community going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but nobody talked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's out in everybody's fucking
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's hydro shops and fucking
new halls going up and down the road.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, Asians sit down, you know,
you know, fucking suspicious, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's gotten everybody stirred up
and it's gotten, you know, it's gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gotten a lot of people stirred up
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, you know, a part that the
community needs to learn how to accept and
[SPEAKER_02]: work with flow with work with rather than
work against because these people are
[SPEAKER_02]: digging in.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the same people who broke the
back of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: military with the Ho Chi Man Trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will break these fucking Riverside
County sheriffs and they will break any
[SPEAKER_02]: people up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dug in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're backed by the Chinese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep money and deep pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that realize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, people who realize that the
Appalachian way before people like me
[SPEAKER_02]: probably did and realize where do we put
the money, buy land up there, put these
[SPEAKER_02]: farms up there, put these former guys in,
you know, let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people who realize this shit way
before others do and buy into this area,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like the Coachella thing a few
years ago, all this fucking desert land
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden turning into huge
warehouses and once was going for five
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's now going for one hundred thousand
acre shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you look into that and then you
realize, oh, OK, that's back down to one
[SPEAKER_10]: hundred dollars an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their shit's falling apart real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was down there not too long ago and
there was a lot of industrial and
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial lots up for sale or,
you know, rent, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people had pulled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of companies that were doing
the same thing you're doing that pulled up
[SPEAKER_02]: shop and went up to Oregon, you know,
shut down, fired everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and bounced out of that little area and
out of that situation, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, eventually that'll
come back to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, you know, in the next
several, especially with this new thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going on with the market and how
things will happen with this, I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really going to go on the shelf for
a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be on the shelf for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of it out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's there and the herds will in
time too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're starting to already.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like you said earlier,
people aren't understanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's a huge market and it's going to
be a huge marketplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to continue to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there they don't understand how to do
it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like you said, like different strains
work different places, different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like people are buying,
spending a lot of money on seeds and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're just throwing them out there,
but they're not throwing them in the right
[SPEAKER_07]: place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's it's problematic because there's a
huge learning curve on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you're talking about on top of.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it all starts is with the
farmer, because what we produce is what
[SPEAKER_02]: you extract or what.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so much that people are
missing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the farmers are with something new
into like a new area.
[SPEAKER_07]: The farmers aren't always there yet
because they're like, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: we got to try different things to see
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the regulation is at to
where, you know, you got to be so hidden
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of like, oh, fuck, you know,
how do I express myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the way, you know,
I grew up anyways, we don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's such a now coming out being
like, you know, like a camera in my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so against everything in my DNA,
like in my survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like to talk about it's
like, you know, well, it's Darwinism.
[SPEAKER_02]: You finally realize, you know,
I was somebody was talking about his
[SPEAKER_02]: Darwinism.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you either fucking get in the
boat or drone, adapt or die.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Jordi was taught said something
about it, and I was like, bam,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it clicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, fuck, did you stay doing
what you're doing and you're dead in a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fucking broke figuring out what you
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I seen so much happening and
like, do you know, do I bring money in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I blow up a brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I go?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and eventually you kind of
realize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Given our brothers, we would have stayed
in the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had opportunities and I've had a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've had opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I'd be exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be in a situation to where,
oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bug, you know, so I've been lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where I'm not tied to anybody or
anything, and I can do my thing and I can
[SPEAKER_02]: stay in my lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a plant, you know, and you guys do
what you do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's that money's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to find lines like you have to
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not even that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even want them to line with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to stay with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd rather do an internet return
than have you up my ass telling me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I'm doing, because if you
know what I'm doing, then you'll do it and
[SPEAKER_02]: do your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we haven't taken any money yet
either.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people have and are in good
places and aren't set up, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with license and are doing their thing and
making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it seems like this business
is always changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what you're doing now,
is that going to be working in five years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what happened to, you know,
MedMen, look at what happened to Canopy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Corona, Tilroy, all these
companies that were just everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we would get ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: So will craft growers be able to survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think it's not necessarily craft
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somebody, if you look into who the
brands kind are, if you look at somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: like you were mentioning, Frenchy,
somebody like that, for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's built he's got a good brand,
he's got a good product, he's found his
[SPEAKER_02]: niche, but he's culture, he's
entertaining, he's Swami.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are people that are- He's a funky
Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, you know, they have a niche to
them, a certain something that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: interested, drawn to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are the guys who will
probably survive in the end, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the guys who have the money,
who do it as a hobby, create the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars, and create the Appalachians
with the cultivars, and do it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: passion, will be the dudes that will be
remembered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be the guy with fucking four
billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is he?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's forgot about now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got fired and gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think, I think, I think,
I think, yeah, because corporate,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no killing that beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I think we are the last in the
industry as small farmers and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, craft guys that have this
passion that can kind of niche out
[SPEAKER_02]: something special that awakens people and
causes consciousness and causes people to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize, oh fuck, maybe the way I'm living
is not regenerative in a manner that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: just fucking taking advantage of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, and we cause something to say,
oh, well, the farming that we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: back East isn't healthy, you know,
and the food that we're eating isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way we're going about it isn't
healthy for the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not, you know, hopefully,
but that's the last product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the last industry that'll do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not going to be some
electronic bullshit that all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_02]: causes consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, oh, it'll be a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it'll be a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then most likely that plan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: What about psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's something that's mind opening.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and in an area where, you know,
especially up in that region up there,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at night you can see all the,
the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you see all the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's fucking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought a, I brought a half ounce of
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some mushrooms up to Alaska in
October, September, October.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fucking, I noticed he starts
like that in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's important to be, and the plant
should be a part of that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you should be taking that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm talking about causing,
you know, that people start realizing the
[SPEAKER_02]: food, the clothes, you know, the stuff
that they're putting on themselves and in
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves is having an impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time all over the world and all over
themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're the farmer that also wants to
make clothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like work clothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, work clothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: You make jeans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what Levi used to,
that's where they first started out with
[SPEAKER_02]: the ham and then went to cotton so they
can make more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you cut ones were out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hemp ones didn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Were they just as smooth?
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually doing great material with
hemp now though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mixing it with the alpaca.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not your great great great
grandfather's now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole nother debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington's hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he was talking about plant the Indian
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at the time everybody knew Indian
hemp was the hemp that got you stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 years prior to even Washington hemp
was being grown in the colonies.
[SPEAKER_02]: European hemp, hemp for fiber and sales
for oil and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be illegal not to grow hemp in
this country.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pay their taxes with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could pay your taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: During wartime you had to grow with the
law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could pay your taxes with it at
one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was the guy writing about Indian
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they hid all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Indian hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Indian hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for rope.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time Indian hemp was the hemp that
was medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't European hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: European hemp was rope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right in front of our face.
[SPEAKER_02]: The history is right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look it up and it's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy's quoting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's panicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: He writes a deal to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the guy who runs his foreman
of his garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's panicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are those seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those seeds need to be planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure those Indian hemp seeds are
planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it's the Indian hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight months later it's like no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's supposedly the father of the
revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of crazy history.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy who goes into the biblical
history and deep into the history of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: All through the Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find that a lot of the
revolutionary dudes were messing with some
[SPEAKER_02]: type of hashish or some type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the writers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he eats an extraordinary amount of
hash every morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a ball of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would kill the average human being.
[SPEAKER_03]: His presence was telling me about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a cliff bar size.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's good for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: He gets so excited too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how my Peter was through that
whole... I was interviewing a French.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was screaming at him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was spitting in his face.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in Desert Hot Springs in August.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 120 degrees out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was on mushrooms and I was super high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I'm gonna pass out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_09]: I kept going inside because it was like
ice cold cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you would come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I get cold and I come back
outside and I get like super hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kept having to go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was me and him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Fritz were just going at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling about 33 parallel shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was screaming at you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not screaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were sitting like where these two are
and I was sitting here facing them.
[SPEAKER_09]: He possibly shat on their appellation
because nobody's ever heard of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, nobody knows about you so you
must be mad.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you basically?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have no genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because where he's coming from,
that is the appellation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where he's coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey buddy, you got the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got the science.
[SPEAKER_11]: You told me it does go way back.
[SPEAKER_11]: You do go back 45.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't have people like French or
Swami or who's ever...
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of culture up there that's
come out of the closet because they've had
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a survival technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to start building a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to start getting more and more.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well what's the true history of this
valley?
[SPEAKER_11]: How far back did it go?
[SPEAKER_12]: At least early 60s to probably... Well
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a part of a biome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the history of our nature.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about a new appellation.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just talking about bringing some...
I'm just trying to bring attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to create anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good that you're seeking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing that the way I can do it is
through the appellation system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: An authentic appellation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I see it and that's what it's
going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of area in San Bernardino
and San Diego and Riverside.
[SPEAKER_09]: That he had an opportunity to get back
into dry farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see on the dry farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some areas you couldn't dry farm
up there though.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also some... So the appellation
would encompass also San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was up to me, yeah it would
encompass a little bit of San Diego
[SPEAKER_02]: County, North County there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably a little bit of South County,
San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that high country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that, you know, that biomass
region.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there another plant that is common to
this high country area?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything along the 33rd parallel.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff that's through the
Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that Moroccan Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Heights.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about just bringing light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he sees it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are starting to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can bring it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can research.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can Google it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called a Mediterranean biome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it only goes along the third.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically like...
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you find a Mediterranean biome?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nowhere else except on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes up a little bit to central,
some of northern, some of those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the hub of it would be more southern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grapes grow well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Temecula Valley is producing
some of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ramona, Temecula.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got some great grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ramona's got 50 wineries.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, this isn't bullshit to anybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish it was.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what a lot of people look at me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most people look at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are like, oh, this fucking
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, just look at the fucking science
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gimme.
[SPEAKER_07]: Farmers were like, have the high IQs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a lot of time on their hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, when you do look at it,
there's other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you still really start
opening it up and you say, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: where do the sativas work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's some of your indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you start going into Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: South Africa, Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start exactly some of the
Mexico, some of these different regions to
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can produce some fire sativa.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many different growing regions will
you find in the high country?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many different microclimates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many different microclimates and many
different soils and different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a couple of different
aquifers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the AVA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within that, let's say like how the
whole Mendo project's going is there's
[SPEAKER_02]: several different areas up in that
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was saying it's probably
going to, eventually it would be multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't just be the Anza Valley,
you know, maybe starting out the Anza
[SPEAKER_02]: Valley, such as how Temecula does in the
AVA.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's spreading.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's actually people that are working
on this particular climate elsewhere in
[SPEAKER_11]: other counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is anybody because I
mean, there's really not a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching out in SoCal to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there may be a handful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somewhere gathering the data because it's
all about gathering data.
[SPEAKER_11]: And nothing but that to in order to create
your Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just work that has to start at some
point.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's farmers coming together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharing information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharing information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying, hey, this is what's working for me
over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only way you do it is go.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're either dead or you.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Voltron, which was like five robots that
came together as one giant robot.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you guys need to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's our bar up in Occidental.
[SPEAKER_03]: You walk in and every single person in
there is a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you used to kind of keep to yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you have an issue, you ask a
question and you get your answer right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming exponentially faster now
because we're out in the open and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to share information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's OK to finally grow cannabis up
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got scared from the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest thing in the industry
is information, you know, sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're coming to that stage where
IPs are so important.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, ironically, then, but then people
get into IP, then all of a sudden they go.
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes from the famine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see it as either you got it or you
don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either you got it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you can fake it all you want
and you can have all the money in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But either you got it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that comes with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to come with having an IP
that somebody in a product that goes along
[SPEAKER_02]: with that, that somebody wants.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's so true.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's true with genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once once a genetics are on the market,
they can't be patented anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, once people put their clones out
and those clones can no longer be
[SPEAKER_11]: patented.
[SPEAKER_11]: But so but whatever someone can say now
that's right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, future, who knows how that's all
going to go out.
[SPEAKER_11]: They change the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, look at corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at soy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at these seeds that are
patented.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go to somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to sign a contract.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're filing patents for all this
stuff and the patents may be broad and
[SPEAKER_11]: we'll see what happens in court anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: But having the Appalachian just that
separates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets you away from all that bullshit
because that's what's going to happen to
[SPEAKER_02]: those hemp growers in the Midwest that
are, you know, Kentucky, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: West Virginia, those dudes that are doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Monsanto like my hemp impregnated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not going to be Monsanto
because they're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monsanto, Monsanto mysteriously just
dissolved away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to be somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we'll kind of collect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Turpenes are volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they were all talking about at
this conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and see, that's where that's where
the expression of the soil in the cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: and that area is going to that was.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: So actually, one of the most interesting
things this woman was talking about was
[SPEAKER_09]: that wine growers are noticing when they
test their wine, new turpenes appearing in
[SPEAKER_09]: their wine that had never been there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, it's you guys in Sonoma growing
down the street being like, sorry,
[SPEAKER_09]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's better than us getting Eagle 20 on
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's the thing is that whole
industry is so fucking poison over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're waiting to see if people like
that or don't like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're either going to sue everyone or
they're going to be like, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turpenes are fucking great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens when the corn farm or like a
separate farmer just decides to throw it,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to edge of my fucking field
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it's coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let it fucking go because then they'll
just.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm running into because a lot
of my people are, you know, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that I'm on the zero point three.
[SPEAKER_09]: Side of things, if if I were the
government and I were watching this right
[SPEAKER_09]: now, I would.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, they are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would throw out male plants in different
regions straight up on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to the commissioner in
Riverside County and kind of discuss like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, what do you guys think about?
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be my enforcement strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a moratorium on that in Sonoma
County until just recently because of
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they just lived in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to put rules in, especially with
the Asian.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, good luck, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what they're hoping is like,
oh, we'll just fucking hopefully these
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp grow because I've already talked to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, that's the thing is I'm not going
to be I'm going to do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, but I'm not going to be partying
with Paul and they want people partying
[SPEAKER_12]: with Paul.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jody, that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you like to party with?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I showed I showed the dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I showed your picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew, you're starting the nerves.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's huge grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that are not the part for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not up to par at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strictly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that should happen because you
know, well, whether it's the whether it's
[SPEAKER_07]: like you're just learning, like you've got
something new that you're doing or the
[SPEAKER_07]: weather sucks or fucking the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what they're hoping is that I
pollinate those dudes that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: illegally growing shit out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, fuck, we hope that you
pollinate everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, it's not going to go down
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if I did, somebody's going to buy
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are your seeds all guaranteed to be
feminized?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have some stock that I'm doing from
guaranteed and then I have some other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but I'll go out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're running around touching them,
you know, at least you can figure that
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
Wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's all new hurdles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never done that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've done decent amount,
but never, you know, and that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a whole new way of harvesting and
what's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to be, you know, it's got to
come down to dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want it to ever really come
down to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to come down to where,
you know, can I afford to have flower hand
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmed when I'm only getting,
you know, an X amount for it instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: shucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And going after.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, you know, that, you know,
we'll see, you know, if I'm jarring it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm getting X amount for it,
then yeah, I got a market for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm realizing is, is where is your
market?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where is, where, where is your
market?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what does it find you or do you
find it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I ain't going to fucking find out
there farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to find you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest problem with farming
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go do something with that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole thing with farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem with a lot,
you know, this whole industry right now is
[SPEAKER_02]: so broken in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many people, gimme,
gimme, gimme.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, you know, the fingers are out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, you know, and in the end,
there's no industry without flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to respect your farmer because
if he can't produce, then what the fuck do
[SPEAKER_02]: you have in the end?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're a lawyer, whether you're,
whether you're a lawmaker, what laws are
[SPEAKER_02]: you going to make if people can't pay you
their taxes?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, in the end, like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did you make laws that people aren't
breaking them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a whole other thing,
but that's the thing is a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't realize like, you know, these
products in the end, they come from a
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer and they come from a farm and you
know, there's a, there's a life behind
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why, like what you're sort of
saying is like, seed to shelf is like sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of that's a, I mean, for a farmer or to
grow a business, that's a huge deal too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're putting product out like
this, no, you can actually do from here to
[SPEAKER_07]: here and in-house in-house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's the thing is you're not
outsourcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do all that in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's nuts now is from clone to out
to distro microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From clone out to distro, it gets tagged
11 times through metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: In and out of the metric system 11 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not vertically integrated,
it becomes a whole other money game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to break down what,
because when it goes international
[SPEAKER_02]: national, that ain't going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that fucking systems or when it
gets hacked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Far away can that be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of shit that's
breaking down in the state that people
[SPEAKER_03]: need to step back and say, that's why it
sucks being the first to all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you run into all the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the luckiest thing I've been is
not, not the first few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's driving my CEO crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't be the last.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what's driving them crazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Driving Shannon crazy, being the first to
everything, you know, cause she had the
[SPEAKER_03]: first outdoor cultivation permit in Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she was one of the first people
to go through the whole process and Santa
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosa getting warehouses and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it is one of the first people to
get it through metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's always been ahead of the curve,
but being the first one off the boat,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes you get shot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Storming the beaches.
[SPEAKER_09]: The good news is you get to go first.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get all the glory.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of that throughout the
history of this planet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of those people don't make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that do are like our goal this
year as a company is to not die.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think whoever survives 2020 is going to
win.
[SPEAKER_12]: Darwinism.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I had, I hide under the
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the problem with pricing structure,
you know, from this, from this county,
[SPEAKER_03]: from this AVA, we demand this price from,
we don't go below this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a group, you're stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just started the first ever cannabis
based Grange in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really starting to build that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling Peter, I think there's about
2 billion that's coming out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: region.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if that grouped up and started
controlling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: How, you know, once it goes across the
States, it's game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys that we're extracting down in the
desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming up there, buying all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once that ran out, they're all
going to try train wrecks for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, it changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell that to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to sit on a bunch of CDN right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to end up having to like
extract all of it in order.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause if it's just sitting there in
warehouses, like you said, it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: get molded.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to get through this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to do all these bad things.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, all right, well, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_07]: If we want to make any money, I guess we
extract it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like at least have like the oils
and the cannabinoids and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's got something to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got something to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's value in CBN cause it has to
age into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think eventually the desert is going to
be the hub for extraction because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: climate, because the dryness and the
facilities that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they'll do once you've got
international going and national,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can just start pulling from
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you start blending,
you know, that's when you start blending
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these extractions that people are
going to be like, wow, this is changing my
[SPEAKER_07]: life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what you're talking about,
like with the CBD, like that's how you get
[SPEAKER_07]: your, that's how you get your brand out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nationwide, then you can go worldwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once it flips over, like you're
talking about, you're already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm doing this for me because,
because eventually the Appalachian,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever plant it's, it's whether it's a
0.3 or not, it's going to have to thrive
[SPEAKER_02]: on being able to cultivate, cultivate X
amount of acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be able to be a small
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, what, like, sorry, has it kind
of with some of those people are saying
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, we're going to put together
these small little, you know, end of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're in 10,000 foot campy,
these collectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be different places for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'd like to see is where I can do
10, 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what on the global market, you're also
competing with a penny a gram out of
[SPEAKER_11]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Produced at a penny a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a Thailand product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Thailand product.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, on a global market.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Thailand is gearing up just like other
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can only grow a Thailand product.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: See Thailand can't do tequila.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what eventually people are
going to eventually people are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize that it's only good brands are
going to come out of the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_11]: What about like what's good in Thailand?
[SPEAKER_02]: What there's got to be what's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oil market, the soup, what's the,
no, the soup in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the good Thai soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out of that region.
[SPEAKER_02]: The court, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I got Thai stick right here and my
flowers, people call it that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and no, that there is, there is a
market there, but I don't, I don't see us,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't see you see people like
hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So California will still rule on the.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, by far, by far.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Frenchies always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you have here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You dumb fuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what you have.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it has to start.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it doesn't make any sense for
him to argue about the, this Valley Valley
[SPEAKER_11]: has the characteristics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then he's just arguing for argument's
sake, but that's French.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't remind me of Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you mentioned that doesn't have
the hype yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the name nor do my
genetics, nor do any Morocco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how dare do I compare it to the
Emerald triangle either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of people that if,
if I would say, I personally think that
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis that comes out of my region
is better than any of fucking rivals.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smokes it out of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes down to it, you know,
when you really look at it and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you put it in some, I'm, I'm nobody,
you know, there's some, somebody's up
[SPEAKER_02]: there that don't want to expose themselves
that do have fucking beautiful genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that people will eventually realize all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you bring me some of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In time, everything in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a plant speed in life here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think because of the dryness
and the two are that, like I was talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the soil, the fungi, the different,
you know, the acidity to the alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the bacterias and alkaline and
acidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot more alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in that mineral, mineral,
high mineralization, the salt,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the, the silicone and some of the
other minerals in it are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the crystallization there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what the plant, when she's
making those cannabinoids, those CBN,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from that CBN that starts to
break down and that flower and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that uses the iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, can you just throw more iron
and more magnesium into your soil to
[SPEAKER_03]: promote those things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but she's only gonna use as
much as the sun and that she can work
[SPEAKER_02]: with, you know, and that comfort stage
too, if it's too, moist, you want that
[SPEAKER_02]: dryness and you want that bright UV,
that UVB light, you know, and that really
[SPEAKER_02]: starts to create something in that ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she's pulling these different
minerals, you know, and we know the iron
[SPEAKER_02]: and the magnesium are the two important,
you know, and the magnesium, the,
[SPEAKER_11]: the THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: So all of these factors coming together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother nature didn't make any mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to find like
with these different turf profiles and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is certain things work for certain people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you've got the arthritis or
you've got whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_09]: What grape varieties grow in mineral rich
soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Malbecs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but then you also get the flinty,
you know, the, the Rieslings, the
[SPEAKER_03]: Alberinos.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grapes love the abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same thing with that
environment up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a stressful, it's hard to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it drives your stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It drives your skin out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard place to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like most of the night, you know,
people have investors come out and they
[SPEAKER_02]: get the shoe dirty and they're like,
oh, fuck it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wind's blowing, you know, like fucking
they want to get out of there as quick as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible because it's a harsh environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not a fun place to be,
you know, within a hundred miles of the
[SPEAKER_11]: border.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you tax that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the wild west.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking shit show out there,
you know, because that's the thing most
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, if you're out there
betraying, you don't want to get out of
[SPEAKER_02]: your car and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I first bought, I wouldn't tell
people where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was like, oh, you know,
I hadn't stood my Huntington beach address
[SPEAKER_02]: or wherever, you know, like, you know,
when I first had like a wonga,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you live a wonga.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's where all the tweeters are
wonga.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bad, you know, it's a high desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a bad, it's, you know,
it's not an easy place to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, but the plant thrives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a magnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and whatever, you know, your jug of,
drug of choice, me, you know, that's a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fucks people's, you know, it doesn't
number on people, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially these people, there's a lot in
the city, you know, but essentially they
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stick out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, but it is a harsh environment,
you know, and that's the kind of people
[SPEAKER_02]: who go to those places to where you're not
going to be hanging out at the beach,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a bunch of drugs and people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you went from Huntington beach to I've
been all over California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been, I used to live up in Mammoth
and I was, I did both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a patroller at June for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had to learn how to ski.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you, cause you, you started as a
snowboarder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I snowboarded since I was a young kid
up in our local mountains.
[SPEAKER_09]: I skied first and then started
snowboarding too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I first skied when I was super young,
like eight, nine, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was when snowboarding was just
getting cool, like early, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mid eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do the snowboard thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it looks way funner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I never went back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I snowboarded once and got hurt so bad and
went back to skis for like two or three
[SPEAKER_03]: years and then took a lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once I take a lesson, I will never put
skis on ever again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck all that noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hurt myself pretty good on skis,
but they're both fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the skis definitely blow apart.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hurts until you learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta pay your dues.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's life though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be a good learning.
[SPEAKER_12]: These companies coming in, they're like,
oh yeah, we got a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're fucking dues.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if you got four billion.
[SPEAKER_12]: You gotta pay your dues.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like snowboard skiing,
baseball, whatever you want, whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acting.
[SPEAKER_02]: These actors don't become actors
overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Musicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking sick of these big companies
with burn rates though for marketing
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I don't know how it's
sustainable to put a $5,000 kiosk into a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary every month.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're not selling $5,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are little companies like us supposed
to fight against it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be specific.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which companies are doing that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so for example, at Urba here down
the street, they have a model where they
[SPEAKER_03]: have like probably 12 or 13 different
companies paying between $5,000 and
[SPEAKER_03]: $10,000 or $15,000 per booth that are
manned $8,000 to $10,000 a day from that
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, paying $5,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing what Urba has done to have
this energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which brands are in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Cresco, Select, Island has got a thing
in there, Kana Craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a handful of them all,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same ones you see in every
dispensary at SoCal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of them, they've taken this model
and they put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the paying for play space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tricky because it's working out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, if everyone starts paying for
play, you're going to have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: $20,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing that the state did and
the local, the municipal did with permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here, pay, you get a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay, you get a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much money are you going to pay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's up to you how good the spot you
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, period.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how this keeps going.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, they're choosing the big
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have burn rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a million dollars a year to
spend on marketing because that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: their budget was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to get market share now
because where else are you going to go get
[SPEAKER_03]: out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to get market share now so
everything else gets stripped away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have that and then they start making
money.
It sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand why they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why they're the suck of, you know,
to be an anchor brand in one of these
[SPEAKER_11]: brands.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're still just throwing away.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for little companies to fight against
those marketing dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impossible.
[SPEAKER_11]: We ask all of them, you know, we ask them,
put them on the spot, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: the retailers about whether they're paying
to play and paying for placement and
[SPEAKER_11]: forcing people to, you know, to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't really want to talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we ask that question?
[SPEAKER_11]: We always ask.
[SPEAKER_11]: We always ask.
[SPEAKER_11]: We ask them straight up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have people pay for that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we always ask them straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been pretty lucky because we're a
small company that some of the places that
[SPEAKER_03]: do pay-per-play haven't charged us for
spot because they respect the small
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to try because those people,
the buyers and the dispensary people.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're their token.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they can make or kill the small
craft called Fiddler's Greens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Fiddler's Greens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make an olive oil based tincture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, they allow because they
know they can make or break the small
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they always just go to pay
and play, it's over for the small craft
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would say to smart play for a
retailer, even if you're doing the token
[SPEAKER_11]: brand that represents the number of
farmers or something like that,
[SPEAKER_11]: at least fucking have that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Will you charge the edible companies,
the freaking vape companies who are making
[SPEAKER_11]: all this money with that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, I forget where we were back
East, but we went into a little wine shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in there, it was an independent like
wine shop, not a huge chain.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had like, there was a basket with
this wine in it and we were looking for
[SPEAKER_11]: some wine and they had a whole description
of the wine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how it was grown and the people that I
read the whole fucking thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I don't know why I read it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a whole long sheet.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they'd gone to that trouble.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a story there about the
vineyard, you know, and the person growing
[SPEAKER_11]: these grapes in this wine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And cannabis has to do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So did you buy the wine?
[SPEAKER_11]: We did get wine from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did get a bottle of wine from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had a club and they had a whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it might have been in Orlando
where my brother lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think he was a member of the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's gotta be a story behind
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you're saying, you know,
but they're allowed to do more things
[SPEAKER_11]: where you can do a wine clubbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do a, you know, so when,
you know, I'm telling you there's money to
[SPEAKER_11]: be made when, you know, and we've thought
about this, about curating, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and, and if you can go, not everyone can
go to the Emerald cup, but if you can go
[SPEAKER_11]: to the Emerald cup and act as a curator
for that seasons for other people,
[SPEAKER_11]: like around the world and be able to
curate for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then provide that for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fucking business model that has
legs on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you can deliver that product
freshly within a couple of days or
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you're talking, now the small farmer
has a direct eventually when the
[SPEAKER_02]: international national, you know,
can and that, and that, and that does
[SPEAKER_11]: require a level of curating because not
everyone can go there to smell and to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be able to curate those things and
appreciate those and to understand,
[SPEAKER_11]: I would get it this way.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you had clients around and you're
going, I'm going to pick 10 strains and
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to dilute.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you were right half the time,
you hit a home run out of the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty subjective though,
until you take it just so that was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the grow off was there was the same
two, same strain for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get to see the exact same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the different levels of them,
based on where it was, it was a great AVA
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment actually to show how different
one story can be based on separate Michael
[SPEAKER_03]: Clements.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really has to be done within the
Appalachians year after year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, to really start taking
and figuring things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this thing's, this whole process
is data.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's data, you know, it's data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do you, you know, when the data is
being held up by the regulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the fuck thing right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the data and then the science
and people do.
[SPEAKER_11]: They also hold onto their data data.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could protect my data, I would
release it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give, you know, I like what happened
with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk about my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know much about files.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know some people feel they got the
bad end of the file stick of the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that galaxy so much too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at that and start playing
through the galaxy, it's the fucking best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, looking back now, you know,
look like some, oh yeah, Rad, I want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to log into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now thinking about it, like,
I would be like, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is my DNA comes from my farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can duplicate whatever that
particular, you know, and if that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: fire that everybody wants, now you have
that code to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the whole thing about the IP is
it protects that code.
[SPEAKER_02]: It protects.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that creates a lot of fear in people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can go up against the giants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you really start looking at this
whole thing and you start connecting dots
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Appalachian, because the only
thing the Appalachian will work is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the government's going to realize,
oh yeah, there is $2 billion in this
[SPEAKER_02]: little hub right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why their helicopters are flying
around and they're looking at this shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're going, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we, we just fucking raided them for
a year straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at there even more, you know,
like they're trying to figure it all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually they're going to go,
well, listen, let's make it, let's try and
[SPEAKER_02]: work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when the whole thing will start
being protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean fucking India?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's other States fucking
with our little bread and butter over
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually I hope to see that kind of come
out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the little small, that,
that particular region, it's not just a
[SPEAKER_02]: small farmer, but it's all the,
the whole, and compass of farmers within
[SPEAKER_02]: the region that are protected under those
IPs and that Appalachian origin that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're protecting that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want that standard and we want to make
that money off that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get people to realize that like,
oh shit, wow, there's a lot of money here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we got to do is make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it starts clicking and some standards
and practices to it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's fucking sustainable,
you know, let's not eat the whole place
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like spit it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, and then I'd be kind of
happy to die after that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, somewhat, maybe a couple
screenplays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely going to tell stories about us
in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but no, that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, you know, be one of the old guys,
look back 20 years from now and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, that was the dude that was thinking
out side of the box with the other people,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, up North that made something out
of this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's this tourist hub.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was playing chess when the rest of us
were playing chess.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever, you know, there's
those OGs that were planting in Temecula,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, same with Sonoma, you know,
that had that dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's make, let's put these grapes
here and see what we're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a, it's, you know,
we claim a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You made world-class wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually way better than I thought
it was going to be in that region.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, this is pretty fucking
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: God bless California.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they need to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to accept the hemp there and let
the hemp clean up the soil and the water
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, be partners with the whole
system and let the two flow and not fight
[SPEAKER_02]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both bring business.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to still want their wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I imagine they're scared of the
millennial generation growing out of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, alcohol and all that,
but steep, you know, it's, it is what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to change with the times,
you know, consolation brands has given it
[SPEAKER_02]: a go, but that's moral.
[SPEAKER_12]: The four billion got pissed away
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see in the end.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good combo and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good talking to you guys and connecting
dots next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll come have you guys up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come check out the region.
[SPEAKER_11]: No,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a beautiful, you come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's harsh environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's what good makes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at wine, you know,
it's not, it does better.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Sepangas, we always had rattlesnakes,
scorpions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a lot of people ask me
like, how do you change certain,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like when you're going through
your clones or your plants or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't fuck with clones because they
don't make it out there so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'll adapt, but they don't do
what my seeds do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, and I, and I, they're like,
this is a little too tough for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to put the seedlings out
pretty young because it hardens them up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and a lot of people are like,
well, you know, I want to keep it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's almost like character.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep a person in a bubble their
whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the millennials now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Expose them to things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It builds this character and that's what
happens in the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what those terpenes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're, they're expressions of
character, you know, their expressions of
[SPEAKER_02]: personality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's what you get when you
expose that flower to those elements.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, if you call someone an
indoor story, great story about the lady,
[SPEAKER_03]: the lady said you're asking how she,
she chose her males and she said,
[SPEAKER_03]: just throw them all out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you come back fucking a month
later, the world is still alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another trick too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the feet, you take a male and you
got them in a pot and you put them out
[SPEAKER_02]: with the females right before he burst and
it makes them go fucking the females nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what, that's when you really
start getting into the male female and
[SPEAKER_02]: really start unlocking some really cool
stuff within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
Yeah.
