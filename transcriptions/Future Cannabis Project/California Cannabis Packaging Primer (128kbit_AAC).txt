[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Courtney Freeman and I spent the last
year working on packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of the first wave of businesses
to bring lab tested compliant packaging to
[SPEAKER_00]: market and it was brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been through it and I've asked the
hard questions and we put together a panel
[SPEAKER_00]: here today to try to dig in and get some
more solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The requirements for packaging have a
universal ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared this little card with many of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a download for top ten highlights
so that you don't have to take notes on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over a few details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran through my presentation with
somebody and I discovered that not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows what tamper evident
packaging is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for heads up, guys, if you go to
the market, everything at the market has
[SPEAKER_00]: tamper evident packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that you know if somebody has
tampered with your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an important element.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is currently very common to be a heat
wrapped plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we're going to be
talking about here today is what inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: me to kind of prompt this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many ways to approach packaging
and in this day and age we've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: serious issues with the amount of waste
that we're creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody seen the headlines about China
no longer accepting our recycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you all know that we have 11 years
before we run out of our recycling
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills for the Northeast here in the
United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in California we've got a little bit
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at about 22 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some simple steps we can take
like rinsing and probably sorting our
[SPEAKER_00]: recycling, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the issues that prompted
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is small businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a small business and it can be quite
exorbitant to pay for the patents and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing that goes into child resistant
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at how we can create
solutions for businesses as well because
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're going to make it, we need all the
help we can get and we're going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of my initiative to bring
a greater sense of community come
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Child resistant packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: A child resistant package is one that is
designed or constructed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly difficult for children under
five to open or obtain a harmful amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: the contents within a reasonable amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the package must not be
difficult for normal adults to use
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know if you all have seen
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These creative boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally adult proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally adult proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent hours trying to figure out how to
do this.
I spent hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had to show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm showing you some examples of
packaging here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important how these solutions
and that one in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with an attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought if you just had to use two
hands, that was child resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of testing that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important issue when addressing
your packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary versus informational panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary panel is the front of the box
or package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you will most likely see when
you are in your retail environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The informational panel is the rest of the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's informational.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government warning is there,
for example, which is quite important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's worth noting for those of you
who are not familiar with packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packaging guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, you may not use cartoons or anything
that's appealing to children.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at the tobacco industry as an
example of why we wouldn't want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we all here are individuals
who are building something beautiful with
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our intention is not to market to
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to be really clear about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, animations are
something that potentially can be
[SPEAKER_00]: misconstrued as marketing to children.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC content, specifically Delta 9,
needs to be outlined on your packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have other types of cannabinoids,
THCA, for example, you may not want to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the front package, the primary
panel, because there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a deviance of more than
10%, that means you could have issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have to redo your packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, in terms of poison control,
we want to know how much THC is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's worth noting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for our industry players,
that's something that could save you a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, you must use a minimum of a
six-point font.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it may not seem like a big deal,
but when you're trying to cram all this
[SPEAKER_00]: detail onto your tiny box, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the universal symbol that we
discussed, I'm going to show you an
[SPEAKER_00]: example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful brand from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is outdated packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that there's an exclamation
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says THC, alerting you to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who don't speak English or don't
know about THC aren't going to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's THC in the package and that
they should be cautionary when consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's another package from
Henry's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the California universal ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question that's often asked,
if you have black packaging, what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: do with this universal ID?
[SPEAKER_00]: Universal symbol is required to be black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if need be, you can create a white
space around it or some other color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just do maybe a two- or
three-point, maybe a 10-point white line
[SPEAKER_00]: around the universal ID just to define it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an easy solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, required by the FTC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must list the licensed manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of packaging important details are
how do we trace packaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an issue, how do we find out
who made it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we track it down so we can take it
off the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one you may or may not be aware of,
but it's important to list your
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients in order of the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to the grocery store,
this is something you'll see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging is the most voluminous
ingredient is listed first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any allergens, you should
include that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number eight, for edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll want to include nutritional content
as well as any coloring additives similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to other products that you buy at the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to highlight something
that very likely you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Employees are required to take a food
safety course if they are manufacturing or
[SPEAKER_00]: creating edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's in the
regulations, 40280 training program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to happen within 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 days of employment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number nine, instructions for use,
such as the method of consumption or
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a little tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds simple, but if you have
concentrate, what do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many applications, but you need to
identify what those applications are on
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, the product expiration date,
the use by, or the best buy date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is especially important for any
perishable items that are water-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm producing a lotion right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's water-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very cautious about
microorganisms or mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the metric ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we're in the seed to seal
tracking, we're going to need to include
[SPEAKER_00]: the metric ID that the licensed entities
will be issuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to note also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that we are so timely with this
conversation is that July 1st is the
[SPEAKER_00]: deadline for compliant packaging to go
through the retail channels that are
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have compliant packaging,
you've done yourself a great favor in
[SPEAKER_00]: being here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, if there's more than one serving,
then the package must be resealable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your serving size must be less than 10
milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's talk about some
medicinal differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 13, if the product is intended for
medicinal purposes or contains more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 milligrams of THC per package,
you need to include the statement for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal medical use only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you should pay attention
to that because you need to be on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for any products that are sold
at the retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us had concerns about that
because we didn't feel like there should
[SPEAKER_00]: be these kinds of restrictions on medical
for those that are treating cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, might be taking a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this restriction, it means that
we have a lot of smaller packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: little pieces of package, plastic that
aren't necessarily value-oriented like we
[SPEAKER_00]: would find in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it does contribute to our
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, 14, the regulations quote a required
government warning that must be in bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the government warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is similar to what you have in the
pharmaceutical industry where your product
[SPEAKER_00]: comes with an insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we can also
leverage if we need extra space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, this one is a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Prop 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who are reintroducing
terpenes, for example, beta-mercine,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that you need to identify
on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research I've done indicates that
beta-mercine is part of solutions for
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But according to California, the research
indicates that when you isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-mercine, similar to when you isolate
cannabinoids like THC, it can give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you isolate beta-mercine,
potentially it can cause cancer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, in the lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to note, Prop 65,
you're not going to find that necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: in the regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you have to really
go through it to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 16, finally, let's address state lab
testing for pesticides and microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not in the regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not aware, we had an update
to our emergency regulations in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that's changed is
the testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, you were required to have a
primary sample as well as a duplicate
[SPEAKER_00]: field sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this has been reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, it was a major expense if you
were not aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you did attempt to bring a package
that was of higher volume to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It meant that when the field testing
samples are taken, they take your product
[SPEAKER_00]: in its final form, in which case you could
lose thousands of dollars to field testing
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's been resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
