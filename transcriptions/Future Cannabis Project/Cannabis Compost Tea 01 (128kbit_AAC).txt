[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, you've got your favorite toy here
that you love like a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about
what you utilize the Vortex Brewer for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this particular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Vortex and other companies make
similar versions of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all based on Cyclone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to how many organisms you can
bring to life and support in a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that they might not
necessarily prefer is based on dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this particular size when you're
using a small machine like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the one that I personally have
just through my own trial and error have
[SPEAKER_00]: found is the most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cyclone action will hold the largest
amount of dissolved oxygen which allows me
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a little bit more concentrated teas
in this than say your five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: with an air stone which works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how many life forms can you
support in the number of gallons that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have and then especially when we're
doing treatments where a lot of this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: can be diluted quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means this 30 gallons might actually
be able to spray 300 gallons if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using a 10% dilution whereas if you're
using five gallon buckets that 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution really wouldn't contain enough
microorganisms to make it that effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to lose the efficiency of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what type of teas would you be making
in here to build organisms for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your top situations that
you would want to multiply organisms to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow life?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on what we're trying to
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first challenge is starting with
taking a clone and putting it into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first challenge that you have is that
most commercially bagged mixes even if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are an organic based and most of them
are based on sterile media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be peat moss, cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really not much in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold moisture very well and they say
they hold the right combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and then they dry out and allow
oxygen giving your soil breathability and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen to the roots is important for all
plants or most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us for cannabis it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for starting out with mixes that are
commercially blended which is really ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: is in a backyard we've got pure rich
beautiful compost that we've made
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves and it's got a complete
ecosystem in it but that's not realistic
[SPEAKER_00]: for a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we end up with is even if they are
organic based they were quick batched
[SPEAKER_00]: which means if you were to take out say a
wood particle in an organic based soil
[SPEAKER_00]: blend and you snap a little piece of that
wood in half what you'll see is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the wood looks dark and broken
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside of the wood is raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they're quick batched.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing it as fast as possible to
pump out the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those things don't have like
an established ecosystem in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just like our gut,
our digestion and many people would say a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of our immune system exists in our
gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing for the plants in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their roots going out into that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their resistance to diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their vitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast, how hard, how big they're gonna
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your kid raised in Iowa on meat and
potatoes and corn versus your kid raised
[SPEAKER_00]: on McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have different growth rates
and health characteristics of those two
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brewer is a great tool for being able
to introduce whatever microorganisms might
[SPEAKER_00]: be lacking in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For something like taking an original kind
of a relatively sterile mix that just came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a composting or just came out of
some sort of a purification process or
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing a lot of times is
introducing like an entire ecosystem into
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil, including all kinds of
different organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those organisms all have all kinds of
different roles that they play and many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them will play different roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will break down nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will create all kinds of antagonistic
enzymes for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will attack molds,
mildews, funguses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will create basically as a product
of their life cycle, they will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: create enzymes that are like a pellet in
penicillin for the soil competing with
[SPEAKER_00]: other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them produce growth hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually will have a direct
relationship with the plant where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying to the plant, I want more of what
you're providing, which in a lot of cases
[SPEAKER_00]: is glucose or just living space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They colonize the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want more area to colonize as the
population increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they will create as a side effect
of their lives, part of their life cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually creating growth hormones
that encourage the roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you see on a lot of the
advertisements for the stuff that you find
[SPEAKER_00]: in hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll show you pictures that enhances
regrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the modes of action, how that
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I just have a question right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, instead of purchasing bottles
of growth hormone or enzymes or amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids, which are all basically byproducts
of biology, byproducts of fungus,
[SPEAKER_01]: byproducts of bacteria mainly,
you can grow that bacteria and that fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: colony inside of this so that you don't
need to spend that money on things in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then in that, one other nice thing
I understand about something like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vortex, because it allows you to create so
much life in such a small area,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does it take relatively of compost to
put in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, let me back up a step.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned earlier that in our
backyard, it's really easy for us to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a big pile of compost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can use that compost and we can
plant right into that compost and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: full of biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a scenario like this, where we have
1.2 acres and we have a sterile medium
[SPEAKER_01]: going out and we need to get that big bulk
of compost in there without needing the
[SPEAKER_01]: big bulk, like how much compost would it
take to mock up a batch of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on how you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two basic approaches to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is basically finding a large supply of
pure, clean, just explosively alive
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and literally washing it with
oxygenated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other approach is to
basically looking at this more as a petri
[SPEAKER_00]: dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduce those organisms and they
basically come in the form of a dust,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what it appears to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're introducing the microorganisms that
you want selectively, picking species by
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and then you're basically giving
them the foods that the food required and
[SPEAKER_00]: the oxygen for their population to not
only wake up from the dormant state that
[SPEAKER_00]: you purchased it in, if you're buying that
at a hydro store or you're ordering that
[SPEAKER_00]: from a scientific supply type of place,
you're sticking it in there basically with
[SPEAKER_00]: a food supply and oxygen and causing that
population to grow in here without
[SPEAKER_00]: actually using compost itself are the two
basic approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with rinsing of compost, the more the
better, as long as your oxygen levels are
[SPEAKER_00]: high enough to keep all that stuff alive
and your PPMs are low enough but that
[SPEAKER_01]: would essentially equate to the same
amount of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would need mountains of compost if we
were just washing that compost and just
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling off what's there, temporarily
keeping it alive and then feeding it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid solution, you would still need a
lot of compost to do that versus- Not
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially feasible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus where you'd actually grow life in
this and multiply life in this by
[SPEAKER_01]: something as simple as a powder that you
can drop in here with some glucose,
[SPEAKER_01]: be it a molasses in there, and that will
multiply that and you'll get, I mean in
[SPEAKER_01]: this 30 gallons, it would be
representative of a mountain of compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: some yards of compost as far as the amount
of biology that this can contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my own experiments, and I'm not a
biologist, I'm not a trained biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: so my experiments are probably pretty
rudimentary compared to what they would
[SPEAKER_00]: do, but in my experience, you are able to
produce five to 20 times as much life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at that under a microscope,
you're looking at how many hundreds or
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of organisms you're able to
identify in one field of view based on
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever magnification you're using and
you will find that the rates of doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: that way are much, much higher than they
are in compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compost is the more diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biology in a lot of cases, what we're
dependent on with that other, the limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factor I should say of the other method is
that a lot of those organisms are not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to be put in a suspended state that is
then able to be put in a bag and sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: without oxygen and put on a shelf and
transported by truck and da-da-da-da and
[SPEAKER_00]: then sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of organisms that just
won't take that, but they will live and
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate readily in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a combination of the two is
kind of the ideal if you're doing both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them in combination with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking things like worm castings
and clean organic compost, really
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically rich organic compost and
washing that while at the same time adding
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those foods and then supplementing
whatever additional species you might want
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually a lot of those are the ones that
are antagonistic to pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: pests, diseases, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it can depend too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to break down your soil
faster, use what's in your organic blend
[SPEAKER_00]: faster, then there are certain organisms
that will increase the rate of decay of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are what create the amino
acids that then make the minerals in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that are insoluble able to be taken
up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduce things like green sand and
calcine clay, montmorillonite,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those type of things that have a
really diverse concentrated mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those minerals are able to be
readily absorbed by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids are what make those available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So picking and choosing the species that
you want that they have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say bacillus subtilis is one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing things like that at certain
times during the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we're going into flowering and we
want them to be able to feed heavier,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we might add a combination of
something that would include a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus strains and possibly
lactobacillus strains as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are able to survive pretty adverse
environments and they break down things
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively fast and they'll recognize
those from milk and yogurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look on the back of a yogurt
thing, lactobacillus, they're the same
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that exist in our stomach and help us
digest food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does the same thing for soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it all depends on what you're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're trying to do, what you're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're trying to do, what you're
trying to do, what you're trying to do.
