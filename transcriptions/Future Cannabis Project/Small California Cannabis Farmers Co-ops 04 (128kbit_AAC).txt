[SPEAKER_02]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, we have a lot of
partners, you know, Patrick, Basil,
[SPEAKER_02]: several of you guys out here that are
building businesses that are cooperatively
[SPEAKER_02]: minded that can fill in those supply chain
gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, going forward, just as with
the seeds and supporting the diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, we also want to support the
diversity of businesses and business
[SPEAKER_02]: owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want a homogenized cannabis
community, a homogenized cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_02]: or homogenized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some of the benefits that
being a member of a co-op and working
[SPEAKER_02]: within the Emerald Grown structure can
provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know a lot of people, you know,
really fret the large scale growers
[SPEAKER_01]: because of what they're doing to the to
the prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're two different markets,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and from what I hear you saying,
there may even be more opportunity for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of craft small farmers because there
is a certain market share that will never
[SPEAKER_01]: be touched by large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, nothing wrong with large
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different it's a different approach
to the same game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one last question I have for you
guys, you know, I know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation going around about certain
organizations that are entering into the
[SPEAKER_01]: market with a certain loss planned on
bringing their product to market in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to gain market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that strikes a lot of fear and a lot
of growers as well, because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: able to even jar up their product for what
these other companies are able to retail
[SPEAKER_01]: or wholesale it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see a co-op lending,
again, resiliency in that level?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think there are some companies
that I think are observably selling for
[SPEAKER_02]: less than they're acquiring for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think there's a bit of a
misunderstanding of what the aggregation
[SPEAKER_02]: supply chain looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you buy a bulk lot of 30 pounds
and you channel some of it into a 60
[SPEAKER_02]: percent margin because it's really high
quality and you sell some of it at a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: percent loss, you're still net positive on
that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you are seeing some things go into
jars that sort of the the mids that came
[SPEAKER_02]: out once you've once you've refined the
highs out of it, you're able to sell a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit under your price and still
remain in, I think, a fair market
[SPEAKER_02]: position.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are absolutely companies that are
selling at a loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you see some venture funded
companies that are burning way too much to
[SPEAKER_02]: not be selling at a loss power to everyone
for trying to survive right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not here to knock anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what the co-op does and
especially what the federation model does
[SPEAKER_02]: is allows us to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can buy bolt pounds at 12 and route
some of it into a wholesale twenty five
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar eight, we can sell some wholesale
seven dollar rates and still, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: still make that sales price work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really about being able to
channel products to their highest value
[SPEAKER_02]: outlet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The marketplace is both brand spankings
and just emerging and also 60 years old
[SPEAKER_02]: and entrenched.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got grandparents that still
smoke the same thing and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: reliable, consistent consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the other thing that the
co-op co-ops don't inherently bring this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but our approach to co-ops do because of
the limitations that Casey talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our co-op also brings a focus on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the existing market, you know,
that free market that's booming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the small growers and all the
people that love them that couldn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of companies trying
to to buy their way into the new market
[SPEAKER_02]: share, the new consumers trying to buy a
slice of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a whole pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to figure out how to bake it and
get it into regulation and compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we're figuring out how to
reduce these costs, how to make this more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient, how to create the most
welcoming system possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a pretty skittish grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am skeptical of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, we're here now
because we need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's worth it's worth taking a second
look, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we're going to sell at a loss,
but we'll be able to to route,
[SPEAKER_02]: to grade, to sort, to be able to behave as
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Selling at a loss is not a great practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've been
reflecting on a lot lately is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four or five years ago, the community went
through the transition to regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was a philosophical transition,
that was a sociocultural transition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was exceptionally difficult and
there was a lot of vitriol around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is that we're going
through the same transition now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic sphere, in the marketplace,
in which the way the state has built the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace, like, you know, me and Amber
are not driving weed to dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, just isn't going to happen for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you we're all grappling with like
the emergence of capital in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does partnership look like and
how do we move forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hard reality is that for for the
most part, without some form of either
[SPEAKER_00]: strong partnership or capital infusion,
it gets really, really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if if you started off as a
subsistence farm and they pile on a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of capital requirements for you to
get through the process, there's there
[SPEAKER_00]: just isn't any leeway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been one of the most
difficult things, you know, for my farm to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to figure out is like we don't have
the money to build a commercial building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the money to get a
distribution license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to have a retail license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we just we're tapped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you you figure out like who you're
going to partner with.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the future look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the same thing with,
you know, in this process of emerald grown
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the management company,
EG M&S is a partnership with capital to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to have capital to operate because
the reality of it is to do to operate in a
[SPEAKER_00]: statewide perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm even in the old days,
I wasn't driving cannabis to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we're we're we're going to
the Bay Area dispensaries, but like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting my way to Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's it's that that question
of like, how do you partner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you partner with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the values that that I think is
what it really comes comes down to because
[SPEAKER_00]: capital is becoming a requirement within
the state because it's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just say, you know, you weren't
driving it to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally couldn't drive it to Osaka.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to emerge very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're all thinking about state
market, but cooperative cannabis is also
[SPEAKER_02]: about our global community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also about the network that we've
built in resistance to this injustice,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from Afghanistan to San Juan
Ridge to so many amazing communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is that network.
[SPEAKER_02]: And working together, we can bring more of
that to the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we are the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think we've been tricked into
thinking we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll concede that we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can bring more of it to the
mainstream if we cooperate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ezekiah Allen, Daniel Fink, Casey O'Neill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jonathan Valdman.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Heart of Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thank you so much for sharing
everything you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
