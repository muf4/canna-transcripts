[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what we were talking about was
grassroots specifications for how long you
[SPEAKER_01]: should cut these things makes it a total
bitch to to try to Get everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's so taut so Todd boldly told
us to Just cut them shorter 42 16s we went
[SPEAKER_00]: by the specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the site You print it out,
but it's off by many inches It's they make
[SPEAKER_05]: it they make it real tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean definitely if you put it together
that way I figured there had to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: secret like you had to start somewhere,
and then it would be you know possible to
[SPEAKER_05]: do we couldn't figure it well for the sake
of For the sake of pipe Costs because when
[SPEAKER_05]: you do like you know restoration 40 of
them You know you kind of have to look at
[SPEAKER_05]: you know the pipe that you're buying too
So a 20 foot one inch pipe will actually
[SPEAKER_05]: do four sets of 16s and four sets Of 42s
so now you've now you know and you have
[SPEAKER_05]: like the coupling is cut off by like
six-stitching So it makes it's a perfect
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 foot pipe So when you know you have you
know 24 beds to make you know you got to
[SPEAKER_05]: pick up 24 20 foot pipes 1 inches and I
pretty much Is the math everything is just
[SPEAKER_05]: math kind of?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much your problem-solving do you do
while high and how much one that high all
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna throw we're gonna throw
this bed together grassroots beds Always
[SPEAKER_05]: like these beds here Okay, so these are
cut 42 and 16 Okay, which is shorter than
[SPEAKER_00]: they told us they told us that these are
supposed to be 45 and a half and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're down there three and a half inches
shorter Yeah, 42 is kind of what we go
[SPEAKER_05]: with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just it's just so easy when you got to put
a hundred of them together You don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know so you because you got things
happening so We found 42 and 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to put the longer beams in and
Contrary to the directions, we're not
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna do the lower You know, you know just
depends like again if you're gonna put a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of soil in there You're not gonna
touch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna stay there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't do them because that's another
You know, that's another for people who
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't a budget.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another hundred bucks a pipe
Possibly depending on how many you have,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Obviously if it's just one or
two, it's not a big deal if it's something
[SPEAKER_05]: you are that that you might move around
Possibly then then yeah, then you would
[SPEAKER_05]: then it would be okay to do that You know,
I've done that on them on multiple grows
[SPEAKER_05]: or I put the bottom in but you know,
if you know, they're gonna be sitting
[SPEAKER_05]: stable then The the soil in the bed itself
will keep the structure, which is really
[SPEAKER_05]: nice Now that we've got all four of them
in just kind of find the find the one
[SPEAKER_05]: pointing low Put that in I wouldn't use a
hand mallet yet I would just kind of get
[SPEAKER_05]: everything dialed in and then and then at
that point you can you can use a mallet
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're gonna turn that and then
another little trick is is put this on the
[SPEAKER_05]: inside at installation That's gonna save
you a lot of a lot of a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_05]: then also if you find one is actually
tight just go to the one next to it and
[SPEAKER_05]: Lift up the bag and that gives you a
little slack.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's just a couple little little
pointers there On that I think also these
[SPEAKER_05]: These ones might be a little long Yeah,
I'm gonna take off just a little bit I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna do that another measure because I
know we measured the other ones but didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: measure this one So I'm gonna give this a
quick measure So are we cutting more I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna cut a little bit off this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just cuz it's a little bit longer
than I like About a half inch So what are
[SPEAKER_01]: we going down to I'm gonna go at 20 and a
half So these ones are now what yeah 20
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half yeah 20 and a half and then the
other one I need and the the long ones are
[SPEAKER_05]: what long ones are 42 and the legs are
what 16 Again, I feel like we probably
[SPEAKER_05]: needed to go down to a 20 Yeah,
even a 42 we're just a little long can we
[SPEAKER_01]: just cut that single one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think probably just So we're way
below I Mean if we if we had stuck with
[SPEAKER_01]: their like dimensions we'd still be still
be here all day trying to trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch it like skin over here Like the
skin of you Young boys that Tom so loves
[SPEAKER_01]: to stretch He keeps in the well in his
basement You know the the the 2x4 I've
[SPEAKER_05]: never put a 2x4 together the 4x4 is Pretty
standard generally the same just 42 16 and
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had that put together in 10
minutes last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no yeah Yeah, that one was pretty
straightforward This one too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just you know when you put something
together the first time once you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: Length right then right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's how taught should it be should be
pretty taught right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well the 16 inches should keep them
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm gonna put a couple in yeah Just
see where we're at on that And then this
[SPEAKER_05]: one here is our troublemaker So you see
there's just a lot of Extra pipe there so
[SPEAKER_03]: if we want to In there smoothly without
any kind of more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just And they might be looking at
me like oh now what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have did this could do that and
this and that but you know, it's Goal is
[SPEAKER_04]: to keep this underneath and pull this one
back Yeah, so the goal here is get this
[SPEAKER_04]: thing On the inside so we can build some
stability here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it's just a little it's a
little long Great segment, I mean they put
[SPEAKER_05]: I put 24 4x4s together and I don't know 40
minutes yesterday and this 2x4 this one
[SPEAKER_05]: 2x4 is defeated is defeating me a little
bit
[SPEAKER_03]: All right boys we're back in action here
There
[SPEAKER_04]: it is, all right boys we did that without
taking out any more pipe And then Tom
[SPEAKER_01]: falls over into the other bed snaps the
other So this whole part is working
[SPEAKER_01]: Companion plants in right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep So let's grab our soil and you can see
based on the measurements here Where
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a little bow in it so we could you
can honestly you could have got probably
[SPEAKER_05]: got rid of You know, we forced it in
there, but you see that bow a couple bows
[SPEAKER_05]: so we can Probably have gone a little bit
shorter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah and made it a little bit easier for
ourselves there but then we'd have to pull
[SPEAKER_05]: it all apart and remeasure so
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom where's the other camera?
[SPEAKER_01]: There oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you got some basin.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a beautiful mix here.
Yep And
[SPEAKER_00]: will and this will it'll still be pretty
heavy It's this the the tupper is it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful material Yeah, you can
definitely see the little bow in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could have probably clipped off another
couple inches off the Yeah, the horizontal
[SPEAKER_05]: 42 inches probably got it could got away
on this one It's just strange to me that
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, you think it would be 16 16 42 similar
to that one, but
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what do we have four of these bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, looks like there's four tuppers And
a Kings max right Just gonna squeak by So
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you to Royal Gold for the soil and
Green Coast Hydro, which is a Cum shot
[SPEAKER_01]: away from Tom's place Rich rich over oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes about ten minutes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich is the man
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the bed looks great little bow
but we're able to get it through it and
[SPEAKER_05]: you come on this side you see without
making the you see without The six without
[SPEAKER_05]: making the bottom we still have some
integrity because it's it's it's packed
[SPEAKER_05]: with soil So you can save a lot of work a
lot of time a lot of the little extra
[SPEAKER_05]: money if you don't Do the bottom but
again, it's all preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about what you're gonna do with
the bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of stability you want Go for
your little Kings mix
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry elaborate on what you were
just saying what would we have done
[SPEAKER_00]: differently with the bottom?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh like you guys were making the Actual
skeleton for the bottom of the bed as well
[SPEAKER_05]: The soil is enough to keep its integrity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not necessary.
Yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: So with those four then we're gonna grab
Premium mix So this is our Organics live
[SPEAKER_05]: premium mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is vegetable Are we using some what
what about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one we're gonna use the premium mix
for this one I thought we used the premium
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed plus this for the other one I
thought this one is actually really good
[SPEAKER_05]: for top dress like so you could take the
rest of that and dress these Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'd be perfect for that This yeah,
so that will actually put in the watering
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay So here's some premium mix we had
four bags and some have a tupper and then
[SPEAKER_05]: one bag of Kings mix and then with this
mix I would Just kind of give it an eye So
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say probably a half a bag of premium
mix to those four bags
[SPEAKER_01]: The companion plants that I'll be in here
will be very happy and with these castings
[SPEAKER_05]: when you do the when you do a blend it's
nice to blend the whole thing in there try
[SPEAKER_05]: to get a Good have to go to the very very
bottom, but it's nice to at least get that
[SPEAKER_01]: first You're actually do it from the other
side so that your ass is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: Last one I would have to like cut when
someone was like bent over in their crack
[SPEAKER_05]: was showing So you see there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of added a little bit of premium
mix Just kind of based on just iron it
[SPEAKER_05]: some experience the way it's smashing
Honestly, you could probably go with the
[SPEAKER_05]: entire bag of premium mix So four bags
want to get your hands in there
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give it a good Good blending and you
know, I could keep it in the top top 12
[SPEAKER_02]: inches Nice top dress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks good Looks like our bag count
was spot on So we already have what do the
[SPEAKER_05]: marigold do they attract The marigold
actually is yeah, it attracts different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah different predators, but really it
repels the repel of the caterpillars Any
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of Like a moth that's gonna lay
caterpillars These are gonna some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: companion plants are gonna help help a lot
and then what's the one some will repel
[SPEAKER_05]: and some will bring in Those things it
brings in helps repel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's basically you're just using nature
to kind of You know, like they they can
[SPEAKER_05]: smell something.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not gonna go near it It's just a
sense that they're gonna give off and then
[SPEAKER_00]: now if there is there the distance between
them Yeah, keeping them close usually
[SPEAKER_05]: usually it'd be nice just to kind of plant
in with the bed But we have so many seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: here Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could you could toss in a couple in
here You can toss in a couple of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean you can toss in You know trouble
areas entryways You know just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: every every everywhere Because they're
beautiful plants too, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make things look good So,
you know, you can kind of just put them
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere and avoid Avoid any kind of
insurgency Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it looks looks great Now perfect
and then what else did we bring so that
[SPEAKER_05]: was so that's your so that's your soil set
and so just kind of based on some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things we were we had Spoken about we got
a come stand over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some the jewel blend
Snorsterium, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and then what's that do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the same thing just kind of
brings in repels.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you you know, you're looking at
repelling aphids caterpillars Just all
[SPEAKER_05]: sorts of different Enemies of the
butterfly in essence, you know things that
[SPEAKER_05]: just really bring in good and repel repel
all sorts of stuff so these are really
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna help nastrium, yeah, the The
calendula and then the marigold which I
[SPEAKER_05]: find the marigold really good,
especially on big scale Because you know
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're out there on a giant field You
really don't have the time to pluck off
[SPEAKER_05]: the caterpillars that you would sometimes
if you were to go completely organic When
[SPEAKER_05]: you have just four plants so marigold is
actually it's gonna be something really
[SPEAKER_05]: good to plant and you can plant a couple
of those Just kind of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just you can plant them around the
plants, you know And then you had talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about bringing some some parsley and some
basil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got some of that as well So,
you know, you can just kind of plant them
[SPEAKER_05]: around here kind of set it aside and then
they plant a couple around the bed and And
[SPEAKER_05]: just kind of help the plants the naturally
avoid pathogens awesome and that along
[SPEAKER_05]: with the worm castings The beneficial
biology all that together should really
[SPEAKER_05]: make make it so that you don't have to use
any kind of pesticide You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in addition to trellising at what
point do we want to start using?
[SPEAKER_00]: These other Nutrients and things that you
left with us last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, so if you if you look at the the
food chart So basically right now we're
[SPEAKER_05]: still in veg, but we're gonna start
turning here Probably like the 1st of
[SPEAKER_05]: August it'll start to move into transition
So at that point Tom, you just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: start adding in so you want to use your VN
10 to 2 soluble powder And when do I use
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this is your transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a 455.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 455.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting close to that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then you have let me see Where's
your VN you you might have used you use
[SPEAKER_05]: all the VN because not all oh,
there you are There's your dry soluble
[SPEAKER_05]: right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so basically right now since they're
the plants are getting big they're getting
[SPEAKER_05]: hungry you're gonna use You're gonna use
The 10 to 2 and then you're getting about
[SPEAKER_05]: a one week or two weeks the first or so
You're gonna start bringing in your 455
[SPEAKER_05]: and then bring those in together That one
teaspoon each right for about about two to
[SPEAKER_05]: three weeks and then you can start to
eliminate this Because they're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: plenty nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna start moving into flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you have a more round all-purpose
455 so the plants are still getting the
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen they need to stretch nitrogen You
need to build but then you're adding the
[SPEAKER_05]: phosphorus and potassium in there As
they're going to you want to add those
[SPEAKER_05]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this way the plants can say oh,
hey look at I got some of this I'm ready
[SPEAKER_05]: for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's available to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm set to go So you'll use that for
two three weeks and then you'll continue
[SPEAKER_05]: to use this and then bring in the PK When
you go when you when you grab that when
[SPEAKER_05]: this when the stretch and the stretch is
over and the flower Begins to start its
[SPEAKER_05]: bulk Then exactly so that's your K.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's your PK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect So yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so your PK your zero ten eight these yeah,
you also watch rugby in addition to your
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom where's the camera?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, leave me alone So this is actually a
great kind of little setup here of the
[SPEAKER_05]: items that we need So Tom before before
they get too big or too far into flower
[SPEAKER_05]: Take one take two milliliters two
milliliters and one teaspoon and give them
[SPEAKER_05]: a foliar in the morning with those three
Together combine together combine all
[SPEAKER_00]: together doing them separately.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can combine you combine all three It's
called we call it the trio FCV FPT and VN
[SPEAKER_05]: dry soluble one teaspoon one teaspoon two
milliliters two to four milliliters two to
[SPEAKER_05]: four milliliters So this is a bigger plant
you're gonna be able to use probably four
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, right and then just do foliar in the
morning one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gonna help That's gonna help a lot
with heat stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna create thick thick stocks You
have some some great thick socks,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's gonna help Kind of mend some
things as well and then after that you
[SPEAKER_05]: just you just this this goes to the side
You really don't need this because this is
[SPEAKER_05]: the FCB is only for foliar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna and then we're gonna move
into essentially having the FPF right
[SPEAKER_05]: there gonna be doing foliars So you won't
be doing any foliars once you're in the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower You know in this in this
environment you probably can get away with
[SPEAKER_05]: it But there's really no need you know if
you can it's all about veg, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can get all your health into veg
everything You need the plant to to take
[SPEAKER_05]: in during flowering is gonna you're gonna
you're gonna that's all gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: during So is that once a week where I do
that morning foliar?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like doing a once once Well,
you could do a couple like for instance
[SPEAKER_05]: right now like on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do the That yeah, I would do on on
Monday I would do you know VN the triple
[SPEAKER_05]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah the trio, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do that on Monday I would skip
Tuesday and then Wednesday I'd come out
[SPEAKER_05]: and just do FPF by itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, one milliliter per gallon Just give
them a good spray and then you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's Wednesday Thursday wouldn't do
anything Friday I'd maybe do a little
[SPEAKER_05]: foliar tea if you're brewing up a tea,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be Mondays.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually tea time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you bring one?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna do one tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have some we have a brewer and a
couple things When you get up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning and the first thing you say is
it's time to make the coffee That's when
[SPEAKER_05]: you that's when you make the tea,
but I do time to make the coffee No,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, that's a great time to kind
of put the tea together so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then move into you move into Basically
essentially this setup here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after veg This is really going to be
your setup here So you're gonna get the V
[SPEAKER_05]: the the VTR transition The back end of
transition and then you're gonna add these
[SPEAKER_05]: two together Until the plant is completely
done stretching and the end of the flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: are really starting to form Then you're
gonna move this out and you go probably
[SPEAKER_05]: another two weeks with just The VPK and
then the last two weeks we're going with
[SPEAKER_05]: just the K because sometimes some genetics
don't really need any more phosphorus But
[SPEAKER_05]: they really like the potassium and the
potassium really hardens the fruit brings
[SPEAKER_05]: some density keeps things super healthy
towards the end if there's any if there's
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be any additions of calcium and
Potassium is something you really want to
[SPEAKER_05]: add as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we are we done with these?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, those things are also those are
gonna be continued to be used as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know This is this is gonna be again.
[SPEAKER_05]: These plants are bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at four mils a gallon
once a week humic It's really gonna help
[SPEAKER_05]: the strength the soil the biology the
alkalinity the environment and then
[SPEAKER_05]: protein building amino acids and things
like that for For your plant and then your
[SPEAKER_05]: SPFs your fulvic acid your simple sugars
your complex sugars Amino acids almost on
[SPEAKER_05]: the percentile.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very high on the amino acid So this
setup right here is gonna take you home
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I would grab And in conjunction
and with conjunction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish Eric was here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric was had like the best segues last
time and then this way here so The bloom
[SPEAKER_05]: and so that bloom is gonna add your you do
a top dress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah of everything around the drip line
Pretty much the whole bed a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: inches like an inch an inch an inch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We outdoor like this Yeah an inch and
that's gonna take you home with good
[SPEAKER_05]: biology Make sure you have chitin
cellulose recyclers in there for any kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of pathogens and then again
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually really nice because it
has a little bit of calcium from the
[SPEAKER_05]: fossilized kelp and then the Foss from the
Cal Foss mineral not that it's relevant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the last time you hear we didn't have
these two trees I noticed that you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are new right a Yellow trumpet bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and a ficus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also want to hit it with the Pacific
Yeah, so last time we didn't do so so our
[SPEAKER_00]: D is this That'll be in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay for now But it also says here you can
actually use this to make tea Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know my garage is really good just
all-around product like anything Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: Micorizy we definitely probably have a
bunch of comments saying oh you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: forgot the Micorizy Yeah, I'm psyched to
see what happens when we add like the fish
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and the Micorizal definitely Yeah,
a little bit of this some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: companion planting and no they look they
look beautiful Big old plants right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, I love the breeze right here
[SPEAKER_05]: It's some bamboo sticks or something and
you know, you can even bring a few in and
[SPEAKER_05]: start to hold these up Yeah, you know just
get those there's like a pack of 12 or
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that's easy to get yeah Like
even once it's trellised I could just
[SPEAKER_00]: still use stocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, you can still use the stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, definitely Use some stocks to
hold these up hold these two up Those as
[SPEAKER_05]: well and then yeah, just all some of the
arms that are coming out, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they know they know that they're being
held up So if they know they're being held
[SPEAKER_05]: up, they're gonna produce more flowers
They're real smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we doing now?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were just talking about top dressing
that With the warm castings bloom has a
[SPEAKER_05]: little Cal Foss little fossilized throw
some in there good casting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Cuz I will mix up the water Yeah,
so just a nice On the drip line area
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom if you had chickens we could feed them
the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe we'll get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's just keep on going Tom's gonna
have six tigers in a couple of months It's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna grow the mullet out Yeah,
just around here is what happens when
[SPEAKER_00]: you've lived in an apartment for eight
years And then you get a yard So now you
[SPEAKER_05]: have You know, these roots are really all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the drip line is extensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just want to make sure we kind of get
all areas Now how are they all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down the roots?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the roots are probably all the way
down and as you can see the top dress the
[SPEAKER_05]: top or the When you move away the top a
little bit you can actually see a good
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of roots So these are yeah,
the root system is really nice on these
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect swing through Just kind of get the
whole bed because you know Based on the
[SPEAKER_05]: drip line the drip line is where the last
leaf is and where the where the rain would
[SPEAKER_05]: drip Over the tree and that anything from
that point inward should be top dressed
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you'll see probably a lot of a
lot of increased health there let's see
[SPEAKER_05]: with those other plants too as well and
then If we're gonna add you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can add some food sources like fish
hydroslate This Pacific grow and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: can water in some mycorrhizae I know we we
didn't add that we didn't have any at that
[SPEAKER_05]: point, but you can always add it After the
fact and some some Bigfoot there,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there's extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's great white.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of great companies that make
What are we using the Pacific grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: for we're gonna put that into the water
and then water it and that's basically all
[SPEAKER_01]: the Hydrolysis that the microbes from the
tea will start feasting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so that's gonna be a combination of
everything here is so I'm gonna brew some
[SPEAKER_05]: tea for tomorrow Okay, great Yeah,
or you can pre-activate one now and well
[SPEAKER_00]: this I mean we're gonna use this now this
is very so why don't we fill it how much
[SPEAKER_00]: water is In there a gallon nothing's in
there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's one gallon in there or do
you know how much it what's the gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the top?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that thing is just there's a
gallon anyway, we can put a splash of
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's like a half to one cup of
that per gallon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and So a cup sure
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect I'm gonna want to get some more
water in here Mix it around So here before
[SPEAKER_05]: you fill that up, yeah, let's add a little
bit of this to it now I know we should
[SPEAKER_05]: have something to measure Well,
just give we're gonna eyeball it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just give her hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah your experience here We kind of
know what a cup is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just gonna It's about a cup This
is actually really nice smells it smells
[SPEAKER_04]: great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the hydroslate it's good and then
yeah the reason is now you can use filling
[SPEAKER_05]: it up to actually Mix it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Do have a wooden spoon over here Yeah,
so we definitely want to stir it up a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit it looks like we got a couple
clumps of the mycorrhizae In there,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I don't know if you guys ever
had sushi before but you know when you
[SPEAKER_05]: make your Wasabi with your soy dip,
you know when you go in there and you add
[SPEAKER_05]: too much of the wasabi it clumps up so
Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, same thing here So you want to add
you want to put in the mycorrhizae first
[SPEAKER_05]: add like a touch of water, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know do a little stir and then again,
but you know, everything is going in this
[SPEAKER_05]: in this one container So regardless of
where the mycorrhizae ends up in regards
[SPEAKER_05]: to what we're watering with there's plenty
of root in there for them to find and
[SPEAKER_05]: Attachment site and you're gonna be So
we're just gonna give this
[SPEAKER_03]: a Little water here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the plant's starting to forgive
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah What you guys do man you cut me up
you bent me you broke me Stabbed something
[SPEAKER_03]: in my soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You broke my arm Ripped me in pieces Hey,
I kind of like it actually you stole
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces of meat
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been so helpful so extremely I
Was like, okay, where do I go from here
[SPEAKER_05]: watch some videos So there we go
beautiful, you know and then Get to
[SPEAKER_05]: activate the biology that castings we've
got some fish in there for some food You
[SPEAKER_05]: know start that tea in the morning for the
next day We're probably ready to go for
[SPEAKER_05]: another watering leaves I know you got
everything going and then you guys are set
[SPEAKER_05]: with some seeds and some companion
planting here Yeah, so why don't we should
[SPEAKER_01]: we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Start spreading this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so basically kind of just depending
on how you want to how to put it together
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom where would you like the basil well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura Smart man smart man So got some
carrots too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we put other things in here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's look at the marigold So we can
just kind of Spread that around a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit Now we can kind of put some on the
sides here And what we'll do Tom too is is
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll water these in but then we also can
do another top dress It's gonna be plenty
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably have Probably some leftover for
that one as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on to that and then again we can do a
Calendula mix here and again probably just
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need much There's a beautiful
seeds and what would you use as like a
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen fixer These are more about these
are more about the pathogen repelling I
[SPEAKER_05]: would use like a anything from kind of
like some barley to different Barley's to
[SPEAKER_05]: a different clovers, you know a fetch
Basically they pull nitrogen out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: air and into the soil and make it
available So a lot of your alfalfa sprouts
[SPEAKER_05]: and grasses and grains We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these yeah, these are definitely are
more of replication, but they'll still
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll sit new stream, but they'll still
have some and what we'll do is actually
[SPEAKER_05]: there's this Leaf market in my opinion has
some really good companion plant seeds And
[SPEAKER_05]: they also have They also have some really
nice Cover crop nitrogen fixing but really
[SPEAKER_05]: it's all about diversity, you know having
like on our field in our hemp field we did
[SPEAKER_05]: 13 different types of cover crops because
you just have you Have to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity because and each acre has all
13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything Yeah, all what were the
13?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, there was barley fetch daikon
radish peas sweet peas Mustard and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: all mixed in together mixed together.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did is we just you know with a
with our wheelie bird Oh, that's a big
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah with our we're going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's mating season.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been going crazy Yeah,
we went back and forth with the premium
[SPEAKER_05]: mix and the seeds and we just mixed them
up and Just went through our 10 acres back
[SPEAKER_05]: and forth and then we used a harrow to
scratch it in and we timed it Right before
[SPEAKER_05]: the first rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then it was because that irrigation is
gonna be very difficult to manage That's
[SPEAKER_05]: like the kind of defeats the whole purpose
So we waited right before the first rain,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the end of November and we'd laid
everything down We got that first rain and
[SPEAKER_05]: then we got multiple rains Afterwards and
that was all that was needed now you can
[SPEAKER_05]: water it but then your daikon rash is
gonna be this big So this is all stuff you
[SPEAKER_01]: grew between They're not growing right
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have marigold right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the marigold growing in between We
have some peas growing in between but
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly marigold because out there
Caterpillars are gonna be an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in San Diego County out We've
seen a lot of issues of fall brook with
[SPEAKER_05]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: The marigold is really helps repel,
you know It brings in things that What is
[SPEAKER_05]: that what are these you're putting in
right here these are the these are the
[SPEAKER_05]: Newt stream Let me see which I grabbed
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah French a French blend No,
that's the marigold And what what was the
[SPEAKER_01]: company you were talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know leaf market I found to have
really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the name of the company It's
online Because we want to be certified
[SPEAKER_05]: organic our cover crop also has to be
organic So those seeds are certified
[SPEAKER_05]: organic and they're non-gmo So if you want
to take it the extra step and have your
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crop It's really important to make
sure those are organic and yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it really is so get certification Those
are the things we really need to do and so
[SPEAKER_05]: with all the seeds we just put down We'll
do is we'll just kind of top dress
[SPEAKER_05]: everything and You know, we're gonna add
in, you know based on where you guys want
[SPEAKER_05]: to put so I I basically put everything
around I didn't put anything to too much
[SPEAKER_05]: in the center So what you can do is is
based on what you want to plant and how
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys want to set it up So you just put
your parsley your basil your carrots?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're you know, you can put your
your you know, if you're gonna do carrots
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna do the parsley the basil Then
you can yeah, you can kind of center them
[SPEAKER_05]: make them and then your marigolds will
kind of Vine, you know fluff out and
[SPEAKER_05]: buying out a little bit on the on the ends
and then once you've placed your plants
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can take the remaining of the
seeds and kind of just place a couple in
[SPEAKER_05]: between and you're not too much to
suffocate but and then also the soil is so
[SPEAKER_05]: This is is so free because it's just
companion plants that you could almost
[SPEAKER_05]: literally Scoop one out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we also wanted to add like one or
two of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'd be pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely so we're just gonna
finish up doing some top dress of these
[SPEAKER_05]: and then what and then just water them in
and That's you know, that's that's gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then and then once they start popping
they grow really fast So you can kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: see the place maybe like I need one here I
need one there and toss another seed in
[SPEAKER_05]: and same thing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take some remainders Pop it around here
and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that'll just really really help
the plants be be healthy And then I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: you go as far as getting some predator
bugs and and different well, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: do an IPM Is that too soon is that I know
because these will be you can you can
[SPEAKER_05]: actually incorporate these because these
will be grown out and everything So it'll
[SPEAKER_05]: be good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So yeah, so that'll be like
mid-august would be a good time to do the
[SPEAKER_05]: as the bugs are coming Yeah, so right now
we're right now we got a good biology in
[SPEAKER_05]: there right now, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good good You have you have a balance of
biology of very high diversity and you
[SPEAKER_05]: have kind and cellulose recyclers that
really really really gonna help the health
[SPEAKER_05]: and now you just want to just give it a
little bit extra love and bring in the
[SPEAKER_05]: companion plants and and some predatory
bugs And I think you're just gonna have a
[SPEAKER_05]: stellar garden for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Awesome Now we have a whole bunch of
other Plants we got to figure out where
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah got room right here and so and you
can you know plant the basil all stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: around it and and and make the Make the
cannabis the centerpiece of the show Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could take one of those put it in here
and then put the basil in one of those
[SPEAKER_05]: like 10 gallon pots So now it's great we
clean them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we cut some clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a top dress We we shown we shown
how you can make a mistake into something
[SPEAKER_05]: Beneficial and you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean because a newbie would have would
have had that broke and go my god And
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe you would have cried and we're like
I broke one of my four plants But not
[SPEAKER_05]: really, you know, you you snapped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, you can you look at that?
[SPEAKER_05]: They say when you break your bone,
yeah You're gonna get it's gonna be a nice
[SPEAKER_05]: cow to the cow cow cow is we call that
just a kind of a chunky Little bump right
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll heal real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see and and that's good I mean
that's good for even even if someone as
[SPEAKER_05]: serious as us, you know, we look at that
It's good to pass the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't break your plant You're
actually it's it's gonna be okay and you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't you know Some people might have sent
the whole thing off and and been bummed
[SPEAKER_05]: but really it's it's Yeah, well it was
instructive bit anyway because we bet we
[SPEAKER_00]: were testing it's you know, the Bend
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah time next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get medieval on these things and
start training them Yeah training them
[SPEAKER_05]: snapping them, but I would do that soon
prior to Transition you want to keep all
[SPEAKER_05]: the stress in veg?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to keep all that stress in the
veg and make sure and flower your stress
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, we want to do trellis Early in
the morning when they're a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: exact flexible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay early morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay after water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay after a foliar is the best time to
Manipulate the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, how you feel like I'm gonna go start
looking at a little I think we tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: like literally literally put them right in
here and yeah Yeah, it's gonna be so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just wait once they water you'll see
there They'll so much flexibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and again if something snaps,
it's okay just well just just put a stalk
[SPEAKER_05]: on it mend it and It'll heal within like
three or four panicking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke my broke this leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look at that Have you been an ankle
model in a free Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Man, those are some attract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost lost that leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why that was the motorcycle
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a compound fracture All
right, I got to hit the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but we're so basically he can
mix up another batch of I would just do
[SPEAKER_05]: play water.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's plain water You know, it'll so I know
some of the seeds I just tossed on but
[SPEAKER_05]: once you water they're gonna they're gonna
fall into the soil The soil is real.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love that tupper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I like that tupper honestly all
this all the soil in the stores that they
[SPEAKER_05]: sell are It's good soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see we're a little bit longer on
this one than we are on that one a little
[SPEAKER_05]: taller a little longer, but you know It's
cool now you got some abstract garden beds
[SPEAKER_01]: To place those Hey, yeah, well we can move
this later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's stable enough to move,
you know, maybe we can even move it prior
[SPEAKER_05]: to Watering because you still have that
flexible once you water so you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I think it kind of likes being there
too like right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Tom look at there after you got four
plants shoppers four plants I know I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I thought it's a panga We used to
have helicopters flying over all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were so close because we were
like a couple thousand feet up I was
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you had to be inside,
but you don't know six plants outside Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: up here and I like Just under a hundred
plants I'm gonna go visit Dr. Elbridge
[SPEAKER_00]: this afternoon and get my my card to go
beyond the limit I'll bring the four more
[SPEAKER_01]: five more lights and we'll set up inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do garage growing I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right team.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's awesome?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No great job looking really Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate we muscled through it,
but we got through it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was it was challenging We have
our challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll clean up the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make it look nice again I know I hate
to just hit and run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't begin to tell you You You You You
You You You
