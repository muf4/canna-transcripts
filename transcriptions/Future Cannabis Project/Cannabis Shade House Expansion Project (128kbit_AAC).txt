[SPEAKER_00]: So we tripled the size of the shade house,
the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out that way, we knocked that side
wall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not side wall, but we flipped it up
and we put the whatever kind of netting
[SPEAKER_00]: this is up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have about 160 square feet on
this side to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also upgraded from the rain
barrels, we have two 275 gallon totes
[SPEAKER_00]: running out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each will eventually be running out to one
to this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we're going to be about eight
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: About eight feet now, where this one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we extended this way This is
iteration one of the row improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back and start cleaning this up
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, 160 square feet on this side,
netting happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, drip system for that room and
then a separate one for out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 19 different strains right now,
a lot of different CBD varietals,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of different types of OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one thing we eventually want to
do is put two drippers in each pot for
[SPEAKER_00]: redundancy, so these things get clogged
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
You.
