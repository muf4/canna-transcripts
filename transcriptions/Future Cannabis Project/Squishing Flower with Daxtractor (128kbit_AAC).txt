[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do a favor and pack a bag for me
to use for a press?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there one already packed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, what flower is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is MK... MK91 is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cross that we have from our friends
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's tri-state distribution right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, Royal Reserve and then we have
different flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, your name is Dax, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Dax tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like you're the dude who built
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess since I have this hat all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one we're doing is yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is this right here?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biscotti?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Galactic Gas, which is 41 and 25
Gelato Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your name, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Choo Choo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: ITSCHOOCHOO.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Choo Choo.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're also looking on for the Dax
tractor, you can go on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Dax tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you build this?
Recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been making hash since like 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with a friend of mine in
Columbus, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: He owns a company called Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still exists in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do CO2 extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked every type of hash in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, a connoisseur of fine
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, you know, at a young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was someone's guinea pig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs helped me get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do a butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do alcohol extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like solvent-less extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lucky for me, I married my wife over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without my wife, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without my wife, I basically couldn't
be right here because her uncle is my,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I drew up the plan and came up with the
whole design, but he's my engineer and my
[SPEAKER_00]: machinist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a machine company, a machine
shop in Johnstown, Ohio, and they build my
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rosentek is my distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invented this and basically it's
built to press flour, bubble hash and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift is what I prefer, which is the three
solvent-less hashes you can make.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started building this press,
there wasn't any presses on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Ohio, it's pretty underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only medical just this year,
but I've been making hash, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time in legal places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as an engineer, what did you want it to
be able to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I basically came up with this design
because I'm an artist and I needed to get
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I smoke too much product that has
bad solvents in it, it gets me sick or it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes my skin break out or it makes me not
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to do a solvent-less model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went ahead and invented this at my
machine shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my art studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't any other companies other
than a few hair straighteners and some
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese like shirt presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would modify plates to go on
the shop presses, which I was doing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the only first, this is the
first CNC like electric cut carbon steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no welds on this machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's all, it's like a refined
race car or a fine sports car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's built better than any machine out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also is able to take 25 tons of
pressure is inside of this beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all American made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hydraulics, the frame, all the
heating elements are made by Watlow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the electronics are future designs
from in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: SPX, the hydraulics that are inside and
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the best hydraulics you can get on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to be a solid USA
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wanted a compact machine that
didn't take up a lot of room in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted a machine that was quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invented this so it's silent and it's
also a lifetime frame and a lifetime
[SPEAKER_00]: warranty on the hydraulics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm trying to build something that I
can not have to reinvest my money in like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I also don't want to waste my money on
solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we need is parchment paper and a
filter and you can make really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here was from flower that we've
been pressing all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is their flower, the Tri-State
and the Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a flower one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also make bubble hash and hash rosin
here at the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a rosin tech labs now and we
distribute and make hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's awesome to make the best hash and
we need a small machine cause with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of power and you also have to have
sometimes more power for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one can do flower and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an all in one machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're pressing, how do you like to
dial it in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like temperature wise, micron size,
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the side of the machine over here,
come around, I put the temp over here and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the heating and the temp that you
can raise and lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it over here so no hash gets on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's protected and when you carry it,
it has the Pelican case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can, so I, today because of the heat
outside and I think it's a good number for
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of humidity we have in the flower
that we're pressing because it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and moist and it'll still flow really
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you get at lower versus higher
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to press flower,
you can usually start around 160 and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can take it up to 220 or those safe,
safe temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go in between those
temperatures, you'll get a nice terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile and a good full extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lower number, you'll get a smaller
extract for flower, but a tastier oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: a little higher will be a little bit more
of an extract with more highness,
[SPEAKER_00]: like more, it's more, more of a percentage
on the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you like to do it at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I press my flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm pressing flower, I like to press
my flower about eight days off the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe about 55%, 60% humidity in the plant
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I press it at 180 and I usually press
it into a jar and I put it in on a lid on
[SPEAKER_00]: it as soon as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the jar is filled and I'll either jar
tech it or I'll just cold tech like a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural cure on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my favorite way for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the rosin one for the flower,
you know, rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for you, you either need to be growing
yourself or have friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps if you want to have the best
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still go to the dispensary and buy
hash plants or flower and it still will
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're picky and you want the best
to sell, you should grow your own or know
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're pressing before it even really
starts curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because I want the terpenes to
still be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the older they get, the less they
degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my favorite type of hash is
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a live bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take basically the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I made a press because to make my
bubble hash better, I need to make a press
[SPEAKER_00]: and I need it to be perfect because the
hash is really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plates are not right or the
dimensions aren't right and the machine is
[SPEAKER_00]: not right, you know, the hash won't be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically, you can make it with a
hair straightener, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose a lot or if you can make it with
almost any of these presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a lab and you're doing a
lot, you're going to lose a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 1% is a lot on a long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I like live rosin the best
because you take the plant when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, when it's done, ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of drying it, you trim it while
it's on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it into a freezer bag,
you freeze it and then you wash it bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash wise and wash it in a, and you put it
in a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is dries your bubble
hash faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the turps are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you wait 24 hours, usually maybe
36.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you live,
it's very humid and you go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Nicka.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, yo, come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm video right now, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got you on a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a world renowned hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's used the Dax tractor and we make this
product for hash makers like us that need
[SPEAKER_00]: the best machine because we don't want to
have something to break on us during the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of our making or squashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could get stuck or the hose could
break, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to let you say hi to him
real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to me about pressing hash because you
like, you don't have to press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once that freeze dryer dries that hash,
it's straight up blonde bubble hash really
[SPEAKER_00]: crisply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take that full melt or four
star, five star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to take that, put it into a 25
micron bag, like one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically if you fill this up with
bubble hash, you can put it right in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's live, like, like I said,
live material, it's the turpings are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be higher than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also going to be very,
neon in color, depending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be purple even, depending on what
flower you're pressing or what type of
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash you're pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we put it in a jar as quick as
possible and we, and that preserves all
[SPEAKER_00]: the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: People sometimes put it in a heat oven and
then turn into more of a saucy diamond or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just cold cure it and it's more of
a batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both are some of the best hashes in
the world in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this machine is what you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently like, like who's, who's cannabis
with what like terpene profile are you
[SPEAKER_03]: digging right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not from Cali, so I'm from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoke a lot of Michigan hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan right now has got some of the
best solvent list hash that I can find on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple, because we're like hard
workers in the Midwest, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they make a lot of stupid laws that we
got to go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to hide in our basements and
make bubble hash, but we've gotten so good
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how we make our hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, the rest of the world bought all
the fancy butane equipment and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making diamonds while we're back
here making, you know, water hash still,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've, we had to make it better than
theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about like, what are the strains in
Michigan that, that you're pressing or
[SPEAKER_03]: doing bubble hash with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of favorites from
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend called, his name's How a
Flower Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and a bunch of other of his friends
I've met, basically SHO, Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, I mean, I could go down a huge
list, but my favorite one's like a Purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have a Motor Breath,
which is really good in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Purple Pebbles taste just
like Purple Pebbles cereal when you hit
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's unbelievable, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my favorite, probably too,
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's which is Garlic Mouth-oater is GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes like old man's breath,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really gassy with the stinky,
stinky finish, but it gets you high as
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're in California today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how would you compare it kind of like
Michigan, Ohio, and California weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: More, no, more, more recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, maybe a little bit more heady in the
Midwest because smaller batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with marijuana, you can pay a little
bit more attention with it and hand trim
[SPEAKER_00]: it where a lot of the stuff I see out
here, people are doing big batch and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have machines that trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the trichomes get knocked off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not putting any Cali weed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of Cali has, you know,
small grows as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I just am new here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't been out here as much,
but people here have definitely made some
[SPEAKER_00]: really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is really good weed for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just partial.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So give some love to the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about her?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does she like to smoke in the
Midwest?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the wife like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he know you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her guess this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll whisper it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does she like?
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes Lemon G 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your real favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite is death star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to smash, smash this guy's
fucking shit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of this variety again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so that's the Scotty and galactic gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Scotty galactic gas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the alien labs connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what temperature are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it right now at 203 degrees,
which I think would be a good terping and
[SPEAKER_00]: a good yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about the press?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can you dial the pressure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dialing, the pressure is very key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to take it slow at first and
build the pressure because we have about
[SPEAKER_00]: how much marijuana do we have here?
[SPEAKER_00]: About maybe 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'd say 10 grams by guesstimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 grams, you don't need as much as an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ounce I'll take all the way up to 20
tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is smaller, the pressure is
only on this amount of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less space taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a little bit less pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take this up to about eight tons
of pressure, which is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that with only two pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plates are together, about two
pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll move around here to the front.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a hand press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take it nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already gushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you feeling for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there, I was just holding it open so
you could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show you that drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really good sign when you see
it drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that because he's got mad turps and
mad THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you see that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the turps off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smashed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about as much as you could smash a
bag for the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the extract is clean, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this guy seems like he's a master.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably makes some really good hash
himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at his hat right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy obviously knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a huge hash following here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge hash following here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk about the hash seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like the Midwest hash seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I'm here is because I
wanted to join an army of hash makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have built a team, the Rosentek,
the Show Labs, the Dab Nation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rosentek Labs, Dax Tractor now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was a competitor of theirs for about
three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, I think, realized this was a
machine they wanted to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I'll get back to painting and
doing art and inventing more while they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell these for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to be a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need a sales force like they and a
lab to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm moving out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see more of me out here probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't, we don't waste these either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you want to move to LA?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you miss Ohio?
[SPEAKER_03]: The winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to cry if you ask her that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't waste these either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take them and we collect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the show, we collect these and we
donate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We either make them into food product by
soaking them in alcohol or it make a
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture or like a coconut oil because
there's a lot of terpenes, a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in the bag still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make a lot of tincture,
whether it's food grade or you can make it
[SPEAKER_00]: for whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pressing hemp, you can make it
for CBD or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: This would go back to like the Rosentek
headquarters.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: The recycled, like the used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're at a place doing it,
they keep their product because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're at a, tonight this is our
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is product we earn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to probably keep it and
donate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: To like an LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or friends or family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever is worthy or whoever is around,
I guess, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they handle that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the rules are on
donating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's probably family and
friends maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe me, I get to keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty nice though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like to make like a salad
dressing with it or like an oil because it
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes it and you can keep it in a bottle
in your fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever after that first press,
do you ever do a second press?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see a second press done or
there's not a lot of oil left.
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that something that you normally
like, would you smoke the second press or
[SPEAKER_03]: would you give it to like other people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Ohio, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's not as much hash around.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second press is just as good as a lot
of people's first press.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Daxtrector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daxtrector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is John Rosen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a pimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this fucking box he's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks like a pimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an evil hash dweller over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll dab you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably, did you do that to the lady
that went out in the... So is that
[SPEAKER_03]: mahogany?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pump this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll record you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'll record you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to pump this second press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hold down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you pump it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to go slowly?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can go fast now, but go ahead and
take it to the 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel it shift into second gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy, but now it's in second gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take it to 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 12 and a half tons of pressure
you're creating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still just going down,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pushing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at almost... Well, you don't have
to go anymore because right now you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: 6,000 PSI, which is roughly about 14 tons
of pressure because we have a 25 ton
[SPEAKER_00]: cylinder inside of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to let it sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a good video and a good thing
to do because you'll see that the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time you press on mine, you get a lot of
oil out that you don't have to do multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some machines aren't strong enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't need to do anything and
eventually it's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're waiting to see if we got it
all the first time, which as of right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing's coming out except for a little
bit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wait for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we didn't do that, you could get
that in the food product like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do it for another 10 seconds and
then just unscrew that left knob to the
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to kind of grip it hard and turn
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I do it now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that pressure release?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plates came down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the second press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just extracted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how much is in each bag left to
do dabbs with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that donation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how you do a flour rosin
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want to smell the second?
[SPEAKER_00]: It still smells really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a first press, right?
