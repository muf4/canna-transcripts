[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, here's an update on the Gorilla Glue
in the 5x9 tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the cuts from a buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second run I had with him,
the first run I had in the 4x4 tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of a trickier strain to grow
for me at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really heavy feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smashed them because the first run,
you know, I noticed that so I tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct for that on this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smashed them with some foliars from
Organics Alive and Nature's Pride Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Aminos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still these three beds on the right
started showing deficiencies there pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: early even though I kept on the foliars
and even up the dosage too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bed I think when I was going through
my notes I saw that because these two beds
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't set up initially it was just these
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I set this one up I didn't have
enough soil in it and I started growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let them grow for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chopped them down and then covered it
with some compost and some more soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's when I planted these girls in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think all that active decomposition
and stuff because this plant just blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafs everywhere, you know, just huge
compared to everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foxtails and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that had something to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, overall they're just heavy
feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, what I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every strain is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains are going to eat more than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some are going to be,
you know, prefer a different environment
[SPEAKER_00]: than others, prefer more water,
less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use these tools that we like
to buy from the grow store and stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, another thing I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the trellis on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know the gorilla glue would
stretch this much so when I put the
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis up they didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I flowered them when they were like
at the first trellis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's how big they got even with me
stretching them all over the place trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep them keep them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess just try to know how much the
strain you're growing stretches because
[SPEAKER_00]: that was an issue for me with the trellis
and keeping the trellis on point is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM always, IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have any problems this run,
thank God, but I did listen to Brandon
[SPEAKER_00]: Russ talk on the Future Canvas Project and
he was talking about the Bavaria bassiana
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had already been looking into that
about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just never got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he mentioned it, I went out,
I ordered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some of that coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor's items, you know, and then the
extract sprays and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would have used different cover
crops, like a more diverse blend as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want that diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those different cover crops would be
released in different exudates waking up
[SPEAKER_00]: different sets of microbes in the soil
getting that that cycling going on but the
[SPEAKER_00]: rye just kind of went out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my grill media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all the beds, I used Costa Maine,
the Stonington blend, and I also added
[SPEAKER_00]: some Malibu compost to some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to others, I'm pretty sure I added the
lobster compost from Costa Maine as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it was already in the
Stonington blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I really like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lights, I'm using the Next Light cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really loved them so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put out a lot of heat at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I can leave them like six
inches above the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like them because of the heat
because I'm growing intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what matters to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a six inch fan and filter to scrub
the smell off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my girl doesn't really like it in
the house, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're growing intense,
something big is controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment of the room that you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that dehu over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's big, like positioning that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I got it, the heat is blowing out
towards that wall right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two tents tend to get hotter and
drier than this tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to finagle it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, check the readings in
all the tents and then adjust that
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge, controlling the temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then, you know, when you're stuck
trying to get it dry in the tents,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also jacking the heat up in the
room, which is going to increase the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like to ever let the tents get
over 60% humidity at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty hard growing in tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big challenge if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just get one big tent or,
I mean, growing multiple ones is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to keep your environment on
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I got these fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get a new oscillating fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the oscillating fan is for above the
canopy for air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this box fan down here, I didn't like
no air movement down here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just keep it on low and blow it
through down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's why I stopped getting
mushrooms popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, mark your beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I didn't do initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could go back, I would, you know,
definitely would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mark them all, which they now are,
so then I can keep, like, meticulous
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, you know, everything I've done to
here, I have to go through all these
[SPEAKER_00]: handwritten notes and, like, some,
like, saved videos and stuff I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I talked about the Gorilla
Glue a little bit already, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch a lot, a lot, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy feeders, but, I mean,
it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super frosty, especially this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the classic Gorilla Glue smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's kind of like an OG undertone,
which I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the OGs, but I got some gnarly
looking nugs over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that I've been defanning,
because they're coming down here in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple days, but you can see the
deficiencies they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I said, I would have hit them
with more, like, extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have had a different cover crop in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got blue mats going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the line coming in from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes in, splits, and then the eight
millimeter tube is running a circle around
[SPEAKER_00]: where it meets back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a purge so I can purge out any air
bubbles or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run that, you know, for like 30 seconds,
like once or twice, or about once a week
[SPEAKER_00]: or once every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're on the distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the soil kind of swallowed
everything, but I usually leave them in,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if I take them out, I don't
remember to hand water them, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: while the crop's drying in here,
so are the beds, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I chop it down, I just hang them in
here to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I leave the blue mats in,
the plants are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the dark, so they're not really
drinking any water, but if I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue mats, they wouldn't be kept
topped off, and they'd dry out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't want my soil to dry out for
the micro life and also for the worms and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think really two weeks of no
water, they'd really dry out that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just to be safe, I leave it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this time, I will be taking them out
just so I can get out this ryegrass,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's the son of a bitch to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, real glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything behind it,
any clones of it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got about six packs of seeds I gotta go
through that I'm pretty excited for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
