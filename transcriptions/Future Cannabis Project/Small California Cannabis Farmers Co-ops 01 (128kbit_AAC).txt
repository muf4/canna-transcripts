[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest conversations going on
right now in the industry is resiliency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, especially amongst people that
don't have corporate funding or don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of money coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm not I'm not saying good bad
or indifferent about where people are
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing their capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not I'm not saying anything about who
people are partners with.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that really matters because we all
have the opportunity to touch our soul,
[SPEAKER_02]: our culture into it and help shift and
direct things regardless of of who's
[SPEAKER_02]: funding and who's helping us keep alive
and keep resilient in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the one of the big questions
that gets faced a lot is as a small brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a small farmer, how do you survive in a
market where there's so much regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: required, where you have to as a grower,
you now have to learn business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You now have to learn marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You now have to learn track and trace.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to create all these different
efficiencies and SOPs and data collection
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to compete in a market where,
you know, we're used to just duffel bags
[SPEAKER_02]: and friends coming over to hang out for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the one of the ways to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we really look at the history of
international horticulture and
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture, cooperatives are really the
way that such that small farms have really
[SPEAKER_02]: had the ability to come together and come
together under a common brand with a
[SPEAKER_02]: common standard and have the ability to
have an umbrella, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with all the logistics so that the
farmer can focus on what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate about because we're all
passionate about different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can link with the right team
that has passion about everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all about the team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with with creating that team,
we have the ability to be resilient and to
[SPEAKER_02]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these gentlemen up here, I'm going to
let them have a couple of minutes to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd just like to introduce who we have
up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Hezekiel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hezekiah Allen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Daniel Fink and we have Casey O
'Neill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Daniel are just getting to know
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really excited about developing
our relationship and hearing more about
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Casey and Hez go back a little bit
and nothing but the utmost respect for
[SPEAKER_02]: these gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have done so much in helping us get
to where we are are going and where we are
[SPEAKER_02]: today and and taking all the curveballs
that are constantly thrown to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I think if we if the
California cannabis had a face,
[SPEAKER_02]: these two gentlemen would be on the back
and the front of the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you guys take a moment and
take a few minutes just to introduce who
[SPEAKER_02]: you are, what you're doing, what you offer
and what you might be what direction you
[SPEAKER_02]: might be going in.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, thank you, Jonathan and
forever flowering for putting this
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so long ago, I lived on a hill and
didn't often leave it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the mythical things that
existed off of the hill was forever
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was still pulling tarps and
like literally the last decade of like
[SPEAKER_03]: coming to know all of you amazing folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So appreciate you and thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Hezekiel and I was born and
raised in southern Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just talking about the earliest
roots of cannabis cultivation by my my my
[SPEAKER_03]: guess it's here and in southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, going back to about 65 is the
first year I can think of that or that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been able to like document folks were
growing seedless in both places.
[SPEAKER_03]: My grandparents started growing in
southern Humboldt in 67.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty close.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd been grown in Pennsylvania for a
couple of years before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was pretty happy being a grower until my
mom decided we were Catholic again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to Catholic high school and did
international affairs and traveled the
[SPEAKER_03]: world for a bit, came home and was a
grower again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got really tired of watching unnecessary
damage to creeks, watersheds, natural
[SPEAKER_03]: resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately had a breaking point when a
pretty close homie ended up getting
[SPEAKER_03]: arrested and going to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one to many people that I knew in
jail for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to be a politician.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned to tie a tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cut my hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved to Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to know a lot of amazing people in
places like you and this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And about six months ago, I decided it was
time to do the real thing that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: do, be a social entrepreneur, go and start
a company with a purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooperatives fill that gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the chair of Emerald Grown,
which is a group of cooperatives and then
[SPEAKER_03]: have recently founded a management company
that basically raises capital and provides
[SPEAKER_03]: services to co-ops to help nurture and
stimulate the advancement of cooperative
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're here to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to talking more in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel Fink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a cultivator for over half my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from upstate New York,
where I was taught how to grow under lock
[SPEAKER_00]: and key in quite a pirate community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots in New York go way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to California about 10 years ago to
move towards compliance to be a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, which was always a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now having the opportunity to go fully
legalized and legal and compliant on all
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, I've seen a need for working
together to be able to band small farms
[SPEAKER_00]: together through cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the chairperson and co-founder of
Grass Valley Grown Cannabis Cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner of Downome Farms,
hopefully soon to be fully licensed Nevada
[SPEAKER_00]: County Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really glad to be here and share
these ideas with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Casey O'Neill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to be out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot of amazing things over
the years about the ridge, and I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: been up here before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having me up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just super jazzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving up the hill and I'm like,
yep, this is where my people live for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm born in the hills, Bell Springs,
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: My farm is Happy Day Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of vegetable production,
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I'm the one you were
referencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely that whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: My folks got the helicopter raid in 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, they set the chopper down and
the National Guard came pounding out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the chopper hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a few loops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got mine in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got off probation, it was kind of
like, well, okay, how does this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the collective model was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started doing the collective
model and being able to do farmers markets
[SPEAKER_01]: and having the produce and the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're having the farmers market
interaction, it's this exchange of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is nourishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is medicine for your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I produced with love.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that exchange is like a really
powerful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what really drove us forward
into the process was like, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been a hard few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot less time farming now,
a lot more time doing paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hope is that we get back to doing
farmers markets again, that we have that
[SPEAKER_01]: direct market connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, as a farmer, we're not allowed
to unless you have a retail license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from the cooperative perspective,
one of the things I'm really excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: is the idea that a cooperative can hold a
retail license and then farms can be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to vend at events under that retail
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of potential in
the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that I've been working
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We launched the original iteration of
Emerald Grown in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of gone through a few loops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an agricultural cooperative for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the regulations passed,
the ag co-op was no longer allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to transfer into the
cannabis cooperative association.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's three or four projects that are
happening now in Mendo and then another
[SPEAKER_01]: couple that are in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something that I remain very
excited about, but it's also very nascent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to figure out the hows
and what's and whys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ideally, we get rid of the four acre
cap and we can conglomerate the size,
[SPEAKER_01]: for lack of better words, have more
cooperatives all together in one rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than like a bunch of different small
cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all kind of into the nuances of
the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remain excited about it and glad to
see the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a perfect segue, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like you guys to talk a little
bit about the legality of co-ops and what
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean by that is what laws are co-ops
governed under?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would an individual need to do if
they wanted to form a co-op?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you guys see as the benefits?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've mentioned a couple of them,
but the benefits of being in a co-op and
[SPEAKER_02]: the challenges that someone might face
within one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ward, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't legal advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to one before you do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to give you my
understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, a cooperative model,
the best way I can think to describe it is
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a template for a specific type of
corporation that's governed by the
[SPEAKER_03]: members, one vote, one member.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can set up any sort of company to
operate cooperatively, but the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cooperative association is a
template in state law.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a relatively prescriptive law,
meaning it gives you a lot of the answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make you figure a lot of things
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tells you when to file your bylaws,
how long to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is chapter 22 of division 10 of the
business and professions code.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald Grown was one of our primary
purposes when formed in 2015 was to
[SPEAKER_03]: advance this law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did pass the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did go into effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in effect now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the cannabis cooperative
association.
[SPEAKER_03]: That provides a few specific benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two that are really important to
hone into.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ability to coordinate crops within
your membership and the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: coordinate pricing within your membership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing those things with other licensees is
considered anti-competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get into a securities exchange
commissions violations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get into financial regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't actually work with competitors
to manipulate market conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a cooperative, you're no longer
competitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You now have this template for how you
relate to one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, you can form a corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can consolidate, conglomerate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the cooperative is a pretty
straightforward template.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other cool thing is that California
maintains a couple other types of
[SPEAKER_03]: cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a workers co-op where a bunch of
workers could get together and own a
[SPEAKER_03]: processing and trimming company,
a very equitable way to manage employment.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's consumers co-ops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you've all been to a natural foods
co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a consumers co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those could apply here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: California also maintains a general
cooperative corporation statute,
[SPEAKER_03]: which allows basically any group of people
to form a cooperative corporation for
[SPEAKER_03]: roughly whatever purpose you would like to
form for.
[SPEAKER_03]: The benefits are really simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to do things that as competitors,
you wouldn't be able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to those basic legal
functions, the co-op also provides a
[SPEAKER_03]: template for bulk buying, pushing costs
down, efficiencies in staffing,
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiencies in marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of opportunities,
but basically that's the legal,
[SPEAKER_03]: as I get it, but talk to a lawyer because
I'm not one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a significant sociocultural
aspect of it in which you have regular
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole process for everybody is this
emotional rollercoaster of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy, I don't know if this is going to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: On any given day, people are a different
aspect in different parts of that ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get everybody together once a month or
once a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, for lack of better terminology,
group therapy where everybody gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: share.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sharing the challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sharing the solutions to the
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, oh, I'm struggling with
DFW right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, well, who's your contact
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it your pond?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole package is so complex and
there's so many different facets to it
[SPEAKER_01]: that it really helps to have that strength
of community, of group and being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk through the issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also you can do things like you can
have attorneys or land use consultants can
[SPEAKER_01]: come and present to the group and people
can ask all their different questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the don't know principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know something, you know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know it, you don't know it,
you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just messed it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know something, you know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know it, you can figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know it, you don't know it,
you don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody will ask a question where you're
like, oh, I didn't even know that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get the question answered and
you're like, cool, that thing I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even know was a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know the answer to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That for me I think has been one of the
most powerful parts of the cooperative
[SPEAKER_01]: process is just being able to have that
dialogue and figure out like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are the things that we're all
struggling with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the solidarity of figuring out how
to move through those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can pose another question to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we've been behind the regulations
and you've got mentors now to look to on
[SPEAKER_02]: how to structure things, how do you guys
see working together and do you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: possibility of different co-ops around the
state actually working together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we know, the OG grows different
down on the coast than it does over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might grow different in town than it
does over here on the ridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you guys see yourselves working
together with other co-ops to even make
[SPEAKER_02]: that supply chain even more so?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you guys see yourselves working
together with other co-ops around the state?
