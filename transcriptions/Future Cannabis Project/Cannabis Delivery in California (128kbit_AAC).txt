[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the biggest piece is 5416D.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working on that since the
beginning of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It first transpired as Senate Bill 1302,
which is a bill that I sponsored along
[SPEAKER_01]: with my co-sponsor, Americans for Safe
Access.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's monumental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 85% of cities and counties
currently do not allow any retail sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've just effectively opened up
the entire state, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: insane beneficially to help quell the
black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as everyone knows, the black
market is completely out of control right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all the taxes, regulatory costs,
compliance costs, everything that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: into the barriers of entry to become
licensed and permitted, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we needed to get that under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now also, consumers alike,
they have a safe avenue to buy licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: and tested products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the 5415.1, which was the tech
regulations for ancillary companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was obviously targeted at a few
specific entities.
Ease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ease, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big win because now that
level's a playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very specifically, that the transfer of
cannabis goods facilitated through an
[SPEAKER_01]: ancillary company is no longer allowed
unless they have ownership in the company
[SPEAKER_01]: through a percentage, through equity
share, through licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made the process of dealing with these
ancillary companies completely transparent
[SPEAKER_01]: and onerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, in this scenario,
Ease has a fleet of trucks, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I should say, quote
unquote, employees are under the guise of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But technically, they're employees of
their partner dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just created a diluted process in
so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say I'm hired on as a driver
through Ease, but really, I'm the employee
[SPEAKER_01]: of a dispensary that I've never stepped
foot in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say I'm injured on the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do I come after for workman's comp or
compensation?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many different ways to
where that can be convoluted, and
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers alike as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I buy an edible from Ease, and I get
sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That completely dilutes the recall
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do I contact to say where this product
came from to eliminate this from happening
[SPEAKER_01]: to so many other consumers that could have
this similar problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or who do I go after financially through a
litigative matter, which statute of
[SPEAKER_01]: limitations under some circumstances is a
very finite time to get your filing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who do I contact to have the attorney
send that to?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just creates a whole slew of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the regulations basically telling the
Ease is the world, you need a delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: license?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that Ease is now going to
get a delivery license?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see that happening just because I
think that one of the main purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the main purposes they've been
operating the manner that they have is
[SPEAKER_01]: because they escape the 280 federal tax
liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: They escape excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: They escape local government tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so many different layers of taxes
they escape on top of the compliance and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory measures and costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Associated with that, I mean, they've
already been through multiple rounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now to switch gears and tell investors
that they're going to have to be liable
[SPEAKER_01]: for these tax responsibilities and these
oversights and these federal risks that
[SPEAKER_01]: they now have to mitigate, it's not going
to be as easy of an ask as it is to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we're an amazing tech platform
investing to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would think, just myself or being a
business owner, it would be the smart move
[SPEAKER_01]: to pull back and become solely a tech
provider because that's going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: easy ask for money from investors and to
continue moving forward with that since
[SPEAKER_01]: they have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are becoming a very big
player in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think their vision was to dominate
up and down the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with them seemingly having to retreat a
little bit, how do you see the delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: market playing out in 2019?
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond, do you eventually see
companies service in the entire state or
[SPEAKER_00]: super hyper local and regional?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to see a little bit of
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this provides a better opportunity
for small business to thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to see some bigger players
start to emerge and gain market share
[SPEAKER_01]: where ease is having to retreat from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be the best of
both worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that a lot of trade
associations statewide within every
[SPEAKER_01]: sector, whether cultivation,
manufacturing, distribution, and retail
[SPEAKER_01]: are now coming together and realizing that
there's an onslaught of Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: investment money, huge investor money
coming in, and a threat of big business
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in to consolidate the industry as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like delivery companies,
I mean, you just mentioned two big wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you're one of the licensee
categories that's actually happy right now
[SPEAKER_00]: as a generality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus I think from small delivery
operations to big, whereas I see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation world, if I were a small
cultivator and just hammered by
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, it's almost like only the big
can play in the cultivation or certain
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But delivery, and tell me if I'm right or
wrong, seems like a part of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: where small players can thrive in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the Bureau and otherwise
recognizes the threat from the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market and what that's doing and providing
the retail outlet and also the equity
[SPEAKER_01]: issues that delivery satisfies,
because it's the lowest barrier of entry
[SPEAKER_01]: license type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with equity rolling out on the state
level with Senator Bradford's equity bill,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was $12.92.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many bills in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the equity issue that delivery
satisfies, low barrier of entry,
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to come in and eliminate the
black market through services provided now
[SPEAKER_01]: into these banned localities, I think that
was a huge win overall for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, the white label issue,
I'm sure that you're aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The IP issue, that was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everybody's freaking out because of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a discrepancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your lane, which is a delivery
company, that doesn't really affect you
[SPEAKER_00]: very much, does it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, sucks for you,
manufacturers and brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever ends up needing delivery,
I'll be there to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are moving into vertical integration
in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to vertically integrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these issues are going to impact
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, if you're currently delivery,
where's the next first step in vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: integration?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going for everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're converting from delivery to
delivery, manufacturing, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And retail or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So delivery, retail, distribution,
cultivation, and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is the first retail location
going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sacramento retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right next to that retail
facility, you'll have a manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or somewhere near it, you'll have your
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge 30,000 square foot warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it meets the needs of all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all different business type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so you can run everything out of that
single 30,000 square foot location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 30,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's segmented off into separate
buildings, all isolated for their
[SPEAKER_01]: different license types.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're moving there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento is going to be our first
vertically integrated facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on finalizing the land deal
in San Joaquin County to move forward as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as their Measure B rolls out,
which is a tax initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then forming a strategic partnership
in the city of Los Angeles currently to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to hopefully capitalize on the
statewide delivery regulation if it is
[SPEAKER_01]: solidified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you have going on down in
LA?
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't necessarily have
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe with that partnership,
it's going to be distribution and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when phase three rolls out,
supposedly in January, delivery would be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to be included in that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so LA city, not county.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say county though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to fund all this, I mean,
are you raising capital or are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, quite honestly, I don't want to do
the day to day operations of this anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've brought in strategic partners for
each aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation, manufacturing, distribution,
and the delivery retail to do the day to
[SPEAKER_01]: day management aspects of it and also
capitalize to do the build outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you acquired that 30,000 square foot
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you leasing it or acquired it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 30,000 square foot space in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm leasing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're leasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have a huge upfront capital
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your we drop is funding the build out
of that entire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did close down on July 28.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let our temporary license run out in
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because astronomical costs associated with
operating in the Bay Area, as I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're aware, just the land costs,
employment wages are extremely higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: $16 to $20 an hour there versus $12 to $14
in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: Land cost was almost $3 a square foot
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a buck in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taxes are 10% in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're effectively 5% with the 1%
contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 5% in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just so much cheaper to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took our capital that had accumulated
from operating in Oakland and put that
[SPEAKER_01]: into operations in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, speaking of Sacramento,
do you know that guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Devlin, come on down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about delivery, Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab that seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, before Joe joins us,
do you think Oakland is getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: message?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems like everybody wants to
get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, Oakland's going to be like,
holy shit, nobody is doing business here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're in the process of running a tax
measure to reduce taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're aware of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that Oakland is a real
pioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been involved with the cannabis
industry since 96 when Prop 215 came
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just really tried to push the
envelope and be on the forefront of what
[SPEAKER_01]: was happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like everybody that did that,
there's things that they're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of applications in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market's going to dictate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to see a lot of businesses
collapse until it levels off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taxes were astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to have to come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing that in a lot of
localities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Santa Cruz has a measure to reduce
their taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few other localities that
are also trying to reduce their taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, because a lot of them started at 8%
to 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not sustainable with an
effective tax of 37 overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just completely unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what percentage of the companies that
two years ago were operating in Oakland do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think either have already moved out or
are desperately trying to get out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a lot, a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: What companies are trying to get out of
Oakland?
[SPEAKER_00]: What percentage of a lot of companies have
already left or some have left?
[SPEAKER_01]: You left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento has a lot warmer water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to get better situated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hear all the time companies getting
ready to leave Oakland or leaving Oakland
[SPEAKER_01]: or shutting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that the market is
definitely going to level out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't put a percentage on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just from the people I talked to,
I'd say in the range of about 25% is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting ready to leave or has already
left.
