[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is always focused on the red and
the blue and later research has come along
[SPEAKER_01]: and started to show that maybe there's
other wavelengths that are of importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: McCree was one of the first people that
usually is cited as the wavelengths that
[SPEAKER_01]: we should be selecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the research that he ended up
doing was actually defining what power
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was defined as between 400
nanometers to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people want to say that between
500 to 600, which is the green spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: is not quite as beneficial because the
plant reflects a lot of that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're finding that as we start looking
to that, the actual efficiency of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants through the green spectrum are
actually quite high, specifically as we
[SPEAKER_01]: get to the amber wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the potential of actually using
amber for growing plants is exceedingly
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The McCree curve shows that that's a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then research that we've been doing at
McGill University has actually shown that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably one of the most beneficial
wavelengths for plant growth, at least
[SPEAKER_01]: from a photosynthetic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're after secondary compounds,
there's other factors that are driving
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a base level photosynthesis,
then it's the amber light that drives
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the work that Bruce Bugby
has been doing, which is on the Emerson
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the impact of far red as it
starts to push into the infrared
[SPEAKER_01]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically saw that in the McCree curve,
it kind of drops off and it basically goes
[SPEAKER_01]: to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no good photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to happen with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the work that he's been doing and has
just been recently published shows that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you take a far red wavelength of light and
blend it with other wavelengths of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: and exactly what the ratio still has to be
debated, it seems to have a beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost you need to have one photon
of blue light with one photon of far red
[SPEAKER_01]: will actually give you the same result as
two photons of a red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to result in the same kind of
effect on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we provide just far red, there's no
photosynthetic activity or almost zero
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic activity that happens,
but the potential of actually blending
[SPEAKER_01]: different wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some growers that like to say,
well, I'm going to give far red light and
[SPEAKER_01]: it has this beneficial impact to my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving a bit of infrared,
so you're increasing your temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're not driving photosynthesis with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're blending it with background
sunlight or other wavelengths of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: so like a white LED amber LED or some
other kind of LED, now you're getting this
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Emerson effect is an additive
effect, but it is not a standalone effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lighting systems that are being
made now, are they not truly effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have too much red and not enough
other colors or amber?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an ongoing debate between
whether or not we should be like a full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, very similar to sunlight is the
one option.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is saying that, well,
maybe we need to have the proper ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: red to blue or have these other
wavelengths in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're finding in our lab is that
there's certain wavelengths that seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't seem to provide much benefit
for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then outside of those ones,
so I'm finding that this happens kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it actually varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: 680 is the easy one to cite.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you start bringing in these other
wavelengths, then having different ratios
[SPEAKER_01]: of them actually have benefits to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't, at this point, I don't think
we've moved far enough to say that we need
[SPEAKER_01]: 1% UV or 5% blue and then add all these
things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we've added our wavelengths together
into one big group, we actually get a less
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic active productivity out of
them than if we would have done just
[SPEAKER_01]: single wavelengths by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can growers take this information
and put it to practical use?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they use it in their purchasing
decisions, in the types of lights that
[SPEAKER_00]: they use?
[SPEAKER_00]: How they use them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can they use it practically?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get that question a fair bit about
how should growers actually use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My normal reaction is that typically,
HPS is still a preferred choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no grower will actually do poorly with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal halide is also a respectable choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it a little bit weaker than the
high pressure sodium, but still a
[SPEAKER_01]: respectable choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The broad spectrum fluorescent lights that
you get from white LEDs are also very
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their efficiency is now surpassing a
lot of these other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So purely from an efficacy, efficiency
standpoint, it's an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting to start to push up
other compounds, so if you're after the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, the CBDs, et cetera out of this,
then there is starting to be a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's early stages, but we're showing
that specific wavelengths, predominantly
[SPEAKER_01]: UV, can actually push up some of these
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me a year from now,
I'll give you a more in-depth answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's still early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, people are interested in
developing those other cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the future, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within the cannabis market,
being able to understand how each one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the compounds is being impacted,
the challenge is that ultimately,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're part of a biological pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we're shining one wavelength,
we're probably stimulating a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we might be losing other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to push up your THC,
you might be dropping off your CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of interrelationship
that's happening between these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means there needs to be a lot of
testing done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're very much
cultivar-dependent locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how the growers are growing the
plants also dependents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some growers will be able to say,
well, I don't need to do this because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing these other tests that allow me to,
or other environmental parameters that
[SPEAKER_01]: allow me to bring these things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kind of play with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does any of this change in a mixed-light
situation, like a light-depth situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've got sunlight and real lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that affect this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within a greenhouse situation,
we typically pull out the UV light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we're changing a lot of the
cabinoid accumulation from that
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding a bit of UVA would actually be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or using a plastic-covered greenhouse
doesn't have the same impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need to add the UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing it indoors, then you do
have to play with those two different
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one just comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you were saying about the far red
stuff in conjunction with other
[SPEAKER_02]: wavelengths, it's almost like the
equivalent of the entourage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a CBD isolate is not as effective as a
full-spectrum medicine in terms of being
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there will be certain
wavelengths that will be beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also some cases that if I add
the wrong wavelength, it will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: detriment to the whole environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the entourage.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the entourage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can pull that wavelength out,
then I will be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, you can't just say,
I'm going to add another wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's going to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be more of an understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are negative and some are positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that the entourage effect
that it's being misused or that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: referring it to at times and maybe not
providing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the challenge with the entourage is
that it's used as a catch-all to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because we know just using it,
like if we say just THC unto itself has
[SPEAKER_01]: these benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we do it as a medical trial,
we don't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to explain something
because the science hasn't got to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point that we can explain what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't say it's misused.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we're trying to interpret
farther than we have a true understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: of at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done any research on kind of
different spectrum for different stages of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth or for different cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that one's a we know that there
will be stage effects on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as they're young seedling or if you're
going to be doing grafting or tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, there is different wavelengths
you should be pushing for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such as?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm after a broad spectrum white early
on, no UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say stay away from the far red
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it starts to push up, now you're
starting to get more development of roots
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're wanting to push into these
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start bringing in more of these
other factors, which has certain stressors
[SPEAKER_01]: and other parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as you start going to the full
flowering events, now that's ultimately a
[SPEAKER_01]: stress effect that we're wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the accumulation of the cabonoids and
the terpenes are purely a stress defense
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to start to stress the
plant in some form at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so higher levels of UV light actually
is beneficial, possibly changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'd be the the far red or the near
infrared type places will actually start
[SPEAKER_01]: to push these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that becomes more of a grower
decision at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about for people who are just running
nurseries or you know, genetics or just
[SPEAKER_00]: clone operations like a dark heart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this information relevant to them as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually if you're just propagating up
to the veg stage, then it's just usually a
[SPEAKER_01]: broad spectrum white usually covers most
of what you need at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably special cases where they
want a certain coloration or leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: structure morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can start to play with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But majority of people aren't after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about plants that are grown for
specific purposes like to make hash or
[SPEAKER_00]: different products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the light requirements different?
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually gets into a larger question on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm starting to see there starts to be
a bit of a segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's field based production,
which is a very, I won't say random is the
[SPEAKER_01]: right, but it's a more natural broad
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is being provided to the plant,
but it also provides a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I'm drinking wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a 1992 wine is different than a
1993 wine kind of perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want the consistent same
level of production, then you have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to control all the wavelengths in the
full environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting to have that
variability, then so for some cases of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are the connoisseurs,
they'll be after that variability because
[SPEAKER_01]: they want the top end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones who are after a consistent
medicinal product that's always providing
[SPEAKER_01]: the same level of pain relief or whatever
they're after, now we have to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: control that more finely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sound like they're almost two
completely different crops and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have to start to treat them as
totally different production systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses, in some cases for very high
precision of like the secondary compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: not your primary CBD or THC, will have to
be even more finely controlled at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can see as we start pushing down
and understand what the sub compounds are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cabinoids that we're going to have
to be exceedingly fine in how we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: control the environment to maintain those
medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, somebody who's more on the adult
side doesn't need quite that resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're going to be doing
extracts for where you're already
[SPEAKER_01]: balancing them afterwards, then you don't
have to be even so close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do think that there will be
production processes that will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce cannabis that is like totally
consistent, like a pack of cigarettes or
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under a full controlled environment,
we find consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you can maintain your genetic
stability through the system, then you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to hold the same consistent
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet genetic stability my understanding
is that the genetics sort of degrade over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you know, when they're not allowed
to express themselves fully or change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So genetics, there's always a slight
mutation that will occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see that within like the brewery
industry also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with yeast, we know that they're always
drifting slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take like a company like Coors,
they spend a lot of money trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain their base seed stock,
which is their yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to be the large
producers that will be doing the Coors
[SPEAKER_01]: like products will have to have that same
level of trying to maintain their
[SPEAKER_01]: stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might have to be some back crossing
to try to get it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be doing genetic sequencing to
maintain this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to hold that quality all the
way through.
