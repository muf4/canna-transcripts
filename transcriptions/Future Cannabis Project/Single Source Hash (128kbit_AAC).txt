[SPEAKER_01]: I think we were talking about growing
terpene and resin-rich cultivars is what
[SPEAKER_01]: you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is growing and selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so how to select was where I was
going with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see water hash, right, as a process
that does not like some of the cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like water-soluble terpenes,
I call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they touch the ice water,
right, they totally just disintegrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: your yields are super low and you're
really left with nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty much just a loss on
everyone's end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pretty much throwing a thousand
dollars down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to help that, my years of just kind of
like poking around with the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding have searched for these bulbous
fat heads that like to act and feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that's kind of like the head
structure that I aim for when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: searching for the hash plant, as I like to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, you're really finding it's a
lot easier of extract or a separation from
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and hash at that point because it's
just like how sand is, it sinks to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the water and you still have
such a something that a head that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to like fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the round, I mean, we're talking
microscopics and like bag screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there was technology that like I
really wish I had that and I'm sure it
[SPEAKER_01]: exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even and maybe I just need to get better
with using certain tools, but it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool to actually have something
that we could take a real generic
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement and size of a trichome head to
know how big it is in ratio compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: the stock, the head ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm sure we can kind of see how
thick the cuticle actually is and
[SPEAKER_01]: determine, you know, maybe possibly how
quickly it will potentially dissolve in
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it will not or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't think it's necessarily
about looking for the actual physicality
[SPEAKER_01]: of the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more about finding that right texture
or that right dryness is what I think he's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, the only way to fucking figure
that out is to wash it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people who ask me on consulting
gigs all the time to come and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me how to use a microscope and
determine what a hash strain is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they'll send me weed like this is going
to smash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always say if we're washing for
fresh frozen, cool, if it's dried
[SPEAKER_01]: material, it's probably going to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it looks trichome rich, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're washing for fresh frozen,
the only way to figure it out is to wash
[SPEAKER_01]: for fresh frozen as far as I know,
or that's the best way to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll know really quick into it,
you know, just by your paddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll know if it's sticky or like,
oh, this is a really shitty resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be hard for me to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to like not just the dry granular
like head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was even talking like live fresh plant
like that's how I know it will be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually just like slightly touch
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see literally, you know,
the heads pop right off like fresh fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: right off the tree, you know, and still be
in that solid head form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, the shapes are all kind of
circular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oval shape, I don't know, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting it right before, you know,
you go down the habit hole of,
[SPEAKER_00]: did we waste the wash or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's to touch it, to feel it
right then and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can gain something from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gains a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're not going to know exactly,
you know, percentage wise or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to know if it's worth
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, I think it's just like those
some plants you could touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to talk to some plants,
I think the lime, the lime, lemon,
[SPEAKER_00]: lime terpene, limamine, that terpene is a
harder terpene to get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's because it comes from
more of a sativa dominant plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Frenchy was saying, the rain and the
climate and the plants are adapting to
[SPEAKER_00]: these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that equator area, to me,
doesn't make a type of solventless hash of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ice water extraction way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find it's the mountain plants,
you know, the Pakistanis, the cushions
[SPEAKER_00]: that have, you know, adapted to that
climate that, you know, make those heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we step out of that, it's Afghani,
you know, Pakistani cushions breeding out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that into like what we found today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the hash plants of today,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you growing and what are you
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's another big thing to bring
up, is it just like when you're a hash
[SPEAKER_01]: maker and you're just washing other
people's materials, it's really not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not that big of an investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that much of a commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it is is your time, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could take someone's garden and process
it in an entire day, a hundred pounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: process it in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what did it take?
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a day in my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gardener that it took them to grow
that whatever, it took months,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, possibly if it was outdoor,
six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I'm saying is like to be someone
who simply washes other people's material,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me is just a completely different
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and I both single source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose to only pretty much wash my own
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really, I'm not currently
interested in washing someone else's
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one day that will go my path,
but I grow enough material to keep me
[SPEAKER_01]: busy, keep me interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what intrigues me is to
take the resin from clone all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of harvest to then process it
through hash and see what comes out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the resin wants you to harvest
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows you, you grew it, you made it,
you created it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it gives it up to you
more, you know, where like the yields I
[SPEAKER_01]: get, I tell people them and they're just
like, oh, those percentages aren't real,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something real romantic and deep
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You two are both, I assume, breeding for
like stuff that yields well or like in the
[SPEAKER_02]: right area.
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breeding for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breeding for obviously yield,
good yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth our time and we can get more
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are some winning genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you asked what flavors are you
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing some, we got a whole bunch,
a bunch of different ones, but like some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, I just made guava punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new one and then there's a lot
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to go down the list,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's something that you watched that you
were excited with high hopes and then like
[SPEAKER_02]: it disappointed you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four or five years ago it was purple
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the other day I watched mimosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like kind of a hype California
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tangy crossed with purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two different like, cuts out there
that are circulating in crowds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's more tangy leaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's more purple punch leaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, oh, the purple punch leaner is a
hash strain because purple punch is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a pretty good hasher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangy stereotypically in my opinion is not
a great hasher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I was told I had the purple
punch leaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Structurally it looked purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2% or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was literally 0.04%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got like 30 grams off of four pounds,
what would be dry material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the whole thing is like,
yeah, we love making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing is like,
it's not only, if it was maybe the world's
[SPEAKER_01]: best hash, I wouldn't fucking care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would eat it that hard and be like,
whatever, I'll keep this all for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the world's best hash,
but it wasn't even like that great of a
[SPEAKER_01]: hash strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I find is like a lot of
people sometimes think that, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: like sometimes those low yielders are just
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like in my experience, it's not that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either the resin is capturable or it's
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either you can grab it and harness it or
you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, yeah, I watched some
mimosa and I ate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually like the ones that you eat it
on, like and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that terpene in another plant
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or cross it with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that mimosa, if I love that,
I could just find something better myself
[SPEAKER_01]: and go hit it with it and maybe next
season get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you gotta mess around with your
stuff and think outside the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a cool little like adult toy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'll find is like it worked really
well indoors on like your coffee table out
[SPEAKER_01]: here with like it being cold and you know,
it is even just doing dabs outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the temps never the same when it's at
this temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it wasn't working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well outside, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool to do it like inside fun
little toy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessary by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I have a bunch of, like he was
saying, dryer resins that run really well,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 8% off that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best I've ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's hash strains, motor breath,
hash strain, key lime, hash strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is literally from the same batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had it in my fridge forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But please smoke as much as you want,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally from the same plug-in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're doing, I don't know if you
know people specifically from Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: but do you know Sunfire Farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's basically regenerates.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's so cow.
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically grows his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's never smoked a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just turns it all into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's doing what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing what everyone here is
preaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a cool story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fuck yeah, I got you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that GMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I'll give you that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that cold cure, like flan shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's whole plant washing, and is he
dumping, like is he bringing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: material back into the greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is he, what is he feeding with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get that lid, please, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's basically doing living soil in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a vague thing for me, living soil
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been building my soil for quite a
handful of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have been building in
the last two years, maybe, or even a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed when I did it in the first
year or two, I had to really take a
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental crop yield loss, because I
wasn't fertilizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it's building up, you're investing in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wondering, how many years have you
been doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still early, so he's with that
expectation that it's just going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you dedicate and stay true,
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like when you cut corners
and you want to supplement and add
[SPEAKER_00]: something in because you feel like it's
necessary, it ends up maybe taking two
[SPEAKER_00]: steps back sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's to each his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel that from a strong light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too hot, look all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows everything and turns it all into
hash, doesn't he?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you smoke your own flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, have you tried this California hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's like, I don't smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up on the East Coast, always
culturally growing New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a religious thing in a
young kid's age over there to roll up a
[SPEAKER_00]: blunt in between just about everything you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he's also, for me it's
interesting, because I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: almost an age thing where he's like,
I don't roll joints, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are so young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this whole other like,
that's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like, this is new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a new, not like brand new,
but freeze dryer tech is not that old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably like five years old or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but in the grand scheme of things,
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they just came out the
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I'm saying is it's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, young people are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you starting to watch the big
stainless steel things?
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, I just used to watch used
trash barrels, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am helping my friend who has a nice
facility back East that I'm helping out
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's went and got those things,
and he spent $16,000 on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I literally told him, man,
I'm going to go to Walmart and probably
[SPEAKER_01]: buy some new trash barrels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we'll go, maybe we'll mess with
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not knocking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, if you're going to spend,
it's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to spend all this money on
have the be all, end all, lab and you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: big brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like what I try to tell people is
like, you can invest minimal money,
[SPEAKER_01]: minimal money that you can instantly
recoup insolveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanical extraction is not hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives you the ability control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the whole other thing was like,
once you start to know the resonance so
[SPEAKER_01]: intimately, I can soak my material and
just look at it and be like, I need to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: it this long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to wash it this many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should row it this hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to make melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should ease off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make rods and I'm just going
to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's just, yeah, I watch different
ways for different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like hand rowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in a snotty way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, it makes the world's best hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I don't have with a machine because I
couldn't afford a machine that
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't at the same thing with a
press like hand pressing, like where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a hand hydraulic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get those flip plums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they blow out like a rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like those really expensive
presses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, again, well, I know you can make
an SOP and show someone how to run those
[SPEAKER_01]: machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like me personally, I just like using
that hand pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a fish on the end of a rod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can feel the bag resist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like, go slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I feel it ease into it and ease
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, it's just something more
about the physicality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like that's what we have to
like remain in this to keep it craft is to
[SPEAKER_01]: be really meticulous about everything we
do and to do it kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can't type in online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't read in a book right now what
our hands are feeling in that machine or
[SPEAKER_00]: what our eyes really see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do it for so many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to lose so many dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you realize what the
hell is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Humboldt County, which is the
land of abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, there is a lot of hash makers
there, fortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helped me out a lot where like when
I like had questions and early on and like
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze dryer knowledge and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people to reach out to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of good hash makers up
in Humboldt County, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, say what you, a lot of people follow
solventless mine and love and hate him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's up near me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always working.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have hash Jacob.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works for Talking Tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes really great product for Talking
Trees in the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great kid, makes great hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Select solventless works for Papa and
Barkley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what you will about Papa and Barkley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Sift is another homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of hash makers, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, you know, everyone's ganja
people up around these parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a little further north than me,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a homie in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my neck of the woods, there's,
I like Brian, Black Ram Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done, yeah, he's actually introduced
me and got me into Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, for that, I mean, he has some
really good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underrated, I feel like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to be on every table,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He holds it the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can ever get some Black Ram
farms hash in your line, you're honored.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you were talking about Jar Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that, somebody called out where B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumbleman did a field test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a field test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jar Tech might be a, that's a wide,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it Jar Tech, but it's this field
test with a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people should probably do it
because if not, you might lose thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars and just come out looking like
a fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, ice and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still need some knowledge of hash
making a sense, or you need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you know that you'll dwell
to base it off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole thing, in my opinion,
is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that they would already know
that, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goes without saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goes without saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but go on, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a little further north up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right over the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a GMO rip, I got one for you
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of people are acting like it's
like done for them, but it's a great,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great hash train.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, people should be crushing it and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everyone should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how many years of fruit,
fruit, fruit, and there ain't no stanky,
[SPEAKER_00]: funky, pissy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't call it garlic mushroom on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it skunky, pissy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up back east in like Massachusetts
where chem dogs from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was born in Bridgewater, raised in
Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in there again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was little Compton, just a very small
little, little town.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Will Coleman?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: 34.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little older than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm from back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up on gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't trying to be rude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just always wait for people to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't feel like they put them on the
spot and peer pressure them into taking
[SPEAKER_01]: rips they don't want.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you grew up in Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then where did you go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you come here next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhode Island took me to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were you growing in Rhode Island?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, from a young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, yes, luckily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what were you growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what things you remember growing in
the East Coast that like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so where the real high grade came in
my little Mecca was like Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got all our high grade from Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to like joke about getting the
high grade from the hippies in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our Humboldt was up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I went after.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I became an adult, I moved up
to Vermont, followed Ganja up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are my.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was to the east of there,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for skiing or for snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which mountain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Killington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I live in Rutland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to ride Jay Peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was up in like Eden area and Jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are my fondest memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, like, yeah, like I said,
we didn't I didn't really know what high
[SPEAKER_01]: grade was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got like Beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like they like was like Canadian
indoor hydroponic weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was the best because it
was better than the Mexican weed that we
[SPEAKER_01]: would get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone showed me like Trinity
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the Trinity, but it was from
Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I was like, oh,
this is what real weed is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just changed my whole view on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were the genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, they were growing the shit
skunk number six that if I could I would
[SPEAKER_01]: do things for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could get that today, man,
I would do things for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had white grape Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had green spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shit called the Elvis at Trinity was
really the most elite stuff that like
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone grabbed up that we would get Mr.
Nice guy over there that was way different
[SPEAKER_01]: than the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like green and it was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the AK we used to get back there was
different than like the West Coast AK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying one's better than the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just different cuts in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, those were the ones that really
burned in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to get this other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called an Arlesburg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably just some cheese,
some kind of cheese cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was really fired too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool to like date your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can like think back to different points
in my life and be like, what was I smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: then?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Manhattan Haze coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manhattan Brown Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about the haze and the
sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The haze and the sour was a regular for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had friends that would eat, sleep,
and breathe off a sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sour diet, the dour diet we would
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour D, haze, and what we called piff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was sometimes like some people
called it from the haze, but the results
[SPEAKER_00]: are just like really cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally, we call it like almost like
spongebob.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the spongy, piffy,
like just the first like craziest looking
[SPEAKER_00]: really chronic weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we always call that piff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was around 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream started coming down from SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cutting open the first vacuum vacpags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Jersey, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking the real Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking like dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit was 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do remember like that's on the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the real cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's that cut, they groaned however
they grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't smoke it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, I mean, it'll come back
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't smoke it anymore today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am laughing because that's what
everyone always argues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Blue Dream I had was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Blue Dream 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Santa Cruz haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some real shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good things, good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always from the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't get that out west out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to, I think in the
future, find a haze plant that hashes
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always chasing like that new turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that new something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got some like Tropicana fucking
cookies crossed with papaya recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds that I'm looking forward to croc
like popping and like papaya turps are
[SPEAKER_01]: really popular right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll probably be played by the time I
have them in my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm always just on to that next
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go for that haze effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we can take a dab of that type of
shit that makes your heart want to pop out
[SPEAKER_00]: of your chest and you get freaked out in a
big crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the last time you got high like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's been fucking forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like, I'd pay big money to
have that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of work at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take that rip and have like
that speedy coke vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just like, I think that's the
canvas plant working in its mysterious
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of bringing you so high up where some
people can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for beginners, but some people
that can handle it, I can get so much
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking work done and maybe skip out on a
meal if I have to just get the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for that more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all creamy cushies nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of saturated with that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You should maybe grab the last dab of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing's his role.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gelato skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to call it wrong, it's called
a gelato skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you hit any of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, his stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same shit, different day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got all different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some straw guava that might... It's
a papaya straw guava.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the papayas are popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dumped really good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: 6.35%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't getting warm in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a rosin, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the hash way more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just separating through a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many flavors coming soon to my
lungs that no one's ever tasted in hash
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these phenos, you gotta buy a pack
of seeds and hunt out the hash phenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really common to get the GMO,
but to have something super unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a good niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're doing the same breeding that
someone's trying for flour, but you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking so... So you popped a whole bunch
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you basically like... I just
like... Hunt it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything goes the same exact way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look at the plant on who's the
biggest, who floured the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that it's who has the best yield
with the best turf, best quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just overall, and then some of them
always come out different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, they're not all gonna come out
white or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different... Tinges of color,
from a gold to maybe even an amber,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still be considered as the best
of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different flavors, different
shades and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
