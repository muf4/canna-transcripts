[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably one of the first companies
in the state of California to run a water
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll do a quick history thing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, really it starts with a gentleman
named DJ Gold back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the ISO II that he sold in high
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was only in there for a brief
time because the DEA came after him and
[SPEAKER_02]: shut him down because he was openly
promoting it as a cannabis extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was also promoting it for extracting
hallucinogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they didn't take kindly to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the ISO II was gone in the mid
70s, there was like a 20 year gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the mid 90s, I started getting
into herbal extraction and we came out
[SPEAKER_02]: with our cold finger units.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a friend of mine, Latha Dodd,
he talked me into starting Eden Labs and
[SPEAKER_02]: he started selling our cold fingers in
high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we consulted lawyers and they said,
you cannot advertise it to do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you need to have a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came up with a tongue in cheek
marketing campaign where the top of the ad
[SPEAKER_02]: said warning not to be used for illegal
purposes, which it was kind of a tongue in
[SPEAKER_02]: cheek way of saying you can make hash oil
with this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sold like crazy in high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where it started with
our little cold fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just started making them
bigger after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a cold finger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole idea of the cold finger,
in 1995, you couldn't really buy an herbal
[SPEAKER_02]: extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing available was the Soxlet,
which is an analytical tool, a distiller
[SPEAKER_02]: extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at the design and I didn't
like it because you had to force these
[SPEAKER_02]: vapors up this tiny tube to get on this
condenser way up here and it took too much
[SPEAKER_02]: heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came up with the cold finger,
which had the condenser and the basket
[SPEAKER_02]: inverted right above where you're boiling
the solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I could get a distillation cycle
going without even boiling solvent or
[SPEAKER_02]: vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what started it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had a chemist friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, well, if you're going to get in
the extractor business, you have to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where everything's headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within two years, we had a very
rudimentary CO2 unit, which I used at one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the very first dispensaries in San
Francisco in like 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just kind of went from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time everything started to take
off, then we had waters on the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my first competitor,
my good friend John McKay here.
[SPEAKER_01]: John?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember moving towards the CO2
extraction side of the business,
[SPEAKER_01]: not from the ethanol or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that side, what we'd done is we
had an automated instrument that would
[SPEAKER_01]: allow me to take the extracted vessel and
change temperature and change pressure on
[SPEAKER_01]: the fly through programmability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having something called a flow meter,
which allowed me to know not only the
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure and temperature, but would give
me a density reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could tie that density reading right
back to the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rather than just pumping at some
indiscriminate pressure and temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could actually say, I want to be at 100
milligrams per minute of CO2 at this
[SPEAKER_01]: certain pressure and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I could start to now start off at
subcritical and take off the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could collect the terpenes
while it's still running and then move it
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 2000 PSI and 35 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I could change that and I could
take off the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the back side, we were able to
have three collectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, Eden only had the one
collector at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I could collect three different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember in Denver, Fritz coming
over and saying, he's kind of looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I says, I'll tell you all about the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went through and probably it was
a half hour, 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Fritz looked at me and says,
I was going to make one of these and
[SPEAKER_01]: people said they would never buy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and from there, what we were able to do
is in the early days, it was moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 PSI and maybe 15 hours down to 90
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that time, other people took up
the challenge and now 5000 PSI and how
[SPEAKER_01]: many grams per minute?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot faster and everyone moved up in
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we do all kinds of different
ranges now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've gone up to 15,000 PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has no bearing on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other things like astaxanthin and
nicotine are best done at super high
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the fractioning
separators that he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's astaxanthin?
[SPEAKER_02]: So astaxanthin is what makes shrimp pink
and crab and lobsters red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a red compound and usually it's
extracted from algae and that's algae that
[SPEAKER_02]: gets eaten by smaller animals and then
gets eaten by the shrimp and the crab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like a really powerful
antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's especially good for your eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to a lot of people whose
vision has come back to normal from using
[SPEAKER_02]: astaxanthin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of considered a super food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're growing this algae in pools and
then drying it and CO2 and extracting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Hawaii and Israel makes a lot of
astaxanthin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of dominate the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market is expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used an analogy last year when I was
here at this convention speaking with AC
[SPEAKER_00]: that the cannabis industry last year had
kind of gone from kindergarten to junior
[SPEAKER_00]: high and now we're in our like awkward
adolescent about to graduate from high
[SPEAKER_00]: school phase, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the tech of it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we've gained more legitimacy,
John was crazy because he had a corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: gig and they were one of the first
companies that really were reputable from
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmaceutical industry to say,
hey, there's something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get our funny PhD and push
this stuff to these guys because we can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a lot of money off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like cannabis companies
having access to hire people of John and
[SPEAKER_00]: Princess Caliber, we didn't have that
until a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you did is you had this,
the advent of the internet directly
[SPEAKER_00]: correlates with the explosion of cannabis
tech and the fact that in California we
[SPEAKER_00]: had such a large marketplace with an
abundant access to cheap material for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to experiment on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really allowed people to proliferate
different types of technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it got regulated, now we can
poach people that are intelligent,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, have spent years getting a
scientific background that aren't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to federal prison now to go work for a
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, while CO2 was,
it was a safer option because we lived in
[SPEAKER_00]: a quasi gray zone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a company with 55 employees at
the time that I bought my first waters
[SPEAKER_00]: machine that was in a major commercial
thoroughfare of Scotts Valley City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we, we had the police
department through and the fire department
[SPEAKER_00]: through, but we had no, we had no permit,
no license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, can, doing butane
extraction or ethanol extraction was a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole dicier game right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's been one thing
where, you know, recently it's not that
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is out of, out of popularity anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that people are feeling more
comfortable doing alternate forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents than they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll always be a place for CO2,
a hundred percent, just like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to be a place for high carbon
and ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all provide different value and can
help create products, either easier or a
[SPEAKER_00]: different array of products for the
combustible marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for a combustible product like
crumble, which has waxes and paraffins in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, using a light aromatic hydrocarbon is
a lot easier to get that texture than
[SPEAKER_00]: using CO2 or something that revives high
amounts of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, CO2 and ethanol are equally good
at extracting a crude oil that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be used for distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the light aromatic
hydrocarbons usually are, lend themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: towards a product that doesn't require a
lot of further refinement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, ethanol or CO2 are
going to be terrific, but oftentimes to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a consumer product, you're going to
need to do a little bit more refinement of
[SPEAKER_00]: those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that it's, anytime I'm talking
with a customer, it's more on the side of
[SPEAKER_01]: what are they trying to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start off with what you're trying
to make, and then you back up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients and how you need those
ingredients to be able to match that
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation for a certain medical
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, if I was to use some of
the lighter hydrocarbons, and I would be
[SPEAKER_01]: using propane, I might even choose propane
over butane because it's a lighter product
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's more pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the other one is tetrafluoroethane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people call that Freon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Freon, but that's a trade name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having something that's light like
that is also not going, it's going to lead
[SPEAKER_01]: the waxes behind like propane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have less of the explosive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't explode because it's Freon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using it in your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I'm moving forward towards
some of the other organic ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's CO2 plus ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's CO2 plus propane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mixture of the hybrids where in the
early days with all the regulations and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, no one was doing any experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're starting to bring in the people
that have the years of experience of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do with the plant and how the
variety changes with each one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: components.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the percentage of water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it 5%, 8%?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the particle size a certain particle
size for different things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so each one of those, and now you're
starting to see the non-extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would call it concentration is the
big picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have separation versus
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extraction is liquid-liquid like making
coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pick apples, that's a separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not actually extracting the apples
from the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're making what some people would
say bubble hash, I would say you're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a trichome that's cold and you
would take it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have the ones that are the
pure trichomes or the different sizes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you might have something that
starts off at 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you take off those beautiful
trichomes and you keep them intact,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a whole different product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're still left with 10%,
12% of something you can extract another
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're actually taking different parts
and doing hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see companies now with three cold
ethanol at might as 60 degrees or minus 40
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see a couple of CO2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a couple of propanes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a couple of tetrafluoroethanes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see a mixture of everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're big enough now,
they're making different products starting
[SPEAKER_01]: off with a formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel like I'm on a panel with
two of my ex-girlfriends too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm both so intimate with the
machinery that you've peddled over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, Fritz, one thing that's kind of
interesting for me is back in the 70s and
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s, you were doing herbal plant
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what led you to that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were you using it for back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it basically started from two
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, I had a girlfriend that worked
at a health food store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got really into herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing was my actual
degree is being a science journalist or a
[SPEAKER_02]: science writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had some articles published.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did one about Shaman
Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dennis McKenna and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so fascinated by that that I had
to have an herbal extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I couldn't find one to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like here I am today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I kind of owe that to Dennis
McKenna to a large degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Shaman Pharmaceuticals was such a
fascinating concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the concept in a nutshell was this
company would send researchers into the
[SPEAKER_02]: rainforest if they found a shaman from two
different shamans from two different
[SPEAKER_02]: tribes that use the same herb for the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought it back to the lab and
studied it and tried to make a product out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two of the people involved with that
was Dennis McKenna and Dr. John Pierce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think he's in cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes by the handle, Dr. J.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody knows him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, they were like early guys with
Shaman Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to know them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing led to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you guys see the industry,
especially on the extraction tech side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things five years from now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any predictions or any trends that you see
that are playing out that people might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's going to be driven by
corporatization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens to every industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like at some point,
there's going to be giant CO2 extractors
[SPEAKER_02]: like the hops industry has that will
probably make an OK product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll be super large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be like the equivalent of
Budweiser or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll still be the micro brews,
the smaller boutique operations that make
[SPEAKER_02]: the higher quality product, whether it's
with CO2 or ethanol or hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're all valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all have their place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you're going to see the giant
factories led by GW, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have to say about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the things that are unique,
I think you're going to start to move
[SPEAKER_01]: towards more of the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my world, I think it's a hybrid that
when I have a product that has rich in
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes, and I knock off most of the
trichomes, and now I'm left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start off at 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 35%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I have some of the unique ones,
not just the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, that's a separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've concentrated something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that concentrate,
you can start to make unique products
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can now do an extraction and
pull off things that you want when you
[SPEAKER_01]: want them and how you want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, I have people that I work
with that I'm pulling off the
[SPEAKER_01]: monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll pull off the sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll pull off the diterpenes so
that I can pull them off when I want them
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to do a whole lot of
post-processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it during the extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part that we've seen,
I know Fritz and I have seen, is that when
[SPEAKER_01]: people were doing the extraction in the
early days, they were just flowing CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: around and around because it was a closed
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I found more recently is if I'm doing
a static where I like making a cup of tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hold the pressure at a certain
point, let it soak there like a cup of
[SPEAKER_01]: tea, then move the flow through again and
pour that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so rather than the old days where they
would decarboxylate before because they
[SPEAKER_01]: felt that it was the greater solubility,
I can now take that soak and have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio of the acids and the neutrals that
come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can cut the time by a quarter
or a tenth of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you can decarboxylate
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one I see is moving towards a
separation with either sonic, so hybrid of
[SPEAKER_01]: ultrasonic-assisted, microwave-assisted,
and then some of the new water technology
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can actually modulate the
pressure of the water to knock off the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes and knock open the trichomes
like an egg shell, but leave the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cell intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now what you're doing is you're
modulating the pressure of a separation to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to do something with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not doing an extraction you're
actually doing a separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you separate the biomass from the
water and the oil by just centrifugation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use a decanter, horizontal
centrifugation, spins around the outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now you're left with the water and the
oil, and then you go through a vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: centrifuge at 6G, and now you move the
water from the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what you've done is a two-step
process like the oil industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: or like the food industry, or like the
dairy industry, where you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: separate the wax from everything without
doing an extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of a separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back to the other point of as far as
which one you would choose, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation-specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I deal in analogies because that's how
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I'm making a yellow cake,
that's very different from making an angel
[SPEAKER_01]: food cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm making a yellow cake,
I can just crack open the eggs into one
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl, put in sugar, put in flour,
and now I'm making a yellow cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm making an angel food cake,
I've got to keep the yolks away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: egg white because I have to have the egg
white, and I have to make that fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to separate the egg whites from
the yolks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like CO2 where you're modulating
or like anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can modulate propane, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are saying, oh, I just have one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can modulate propane because
they're all super critical fluid
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see the world coming to
formulation-specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Fritz says, there's 1,250 liter
vessels doing CO2 in two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's down in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a whole different process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll say the third one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is inline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Fritz and I have done for years,
and that is you do the CO2 and in a
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple fraction, you pull out the waxes
in the first collection vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have a separate vessel that then
cleans up any remaining waxes before it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes over to the second and third.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, by the time you get to the second and
third vessel, you don't have any waxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what you're doing is inline
de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about creating
cannabinoids from yeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's threatening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a menace.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's coming for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's wondering about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's patents out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones out of Florida, the ones out
of the UK also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's called biopharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been doing that for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't actually need the plant to be
able to make things.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example of that was taxol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taxol used to be taken from yew trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would cut down these yew trees for a
small amount of taxol that was used for
[SPEAKER_01]: breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were taking down forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they did is they found a way
of making synthetic taxol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you have all these things
for breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one with yeast is that you can
make one specific cannabinol based on
[SPEAKER_01]: having the starting material, CBGA,
or some of the precursors for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you make THCA synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have CBDA synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have THCV synthase for something that
goes before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of doing that yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're making one specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Albany Molecular Research up in Albany,
New York and with some of the other people
[SPEAKER_01]: has like 20 or 30 of these things going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's how you would do biopharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're never going to have what the
plant makes for partial spectrum or whole
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a single component that's
used for an additive or it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can never have the same capability
as the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what it will likely do is be an
input material for a lot of edible
[SPEAKER_00]: products and tinctures and topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's threatening to a degree from just a
whole extraction standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it's not disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not wiping out the commercial
extraction market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't going to want to light up a
dab torch full of some synthetic THCV any
[SPEAKER_00]: time soon.
