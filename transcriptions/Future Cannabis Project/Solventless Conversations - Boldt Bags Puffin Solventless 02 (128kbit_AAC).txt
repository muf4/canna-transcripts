[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with you as a hash maker So
how long have you been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you made were you making hash
first and then you started the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it started by making hash Necessity
and where were you living?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was up north and my mom had cancer and I
had five sisters who happened to Know how
[SPEAKER_02]: to sew and they helped me sew a bag
together because my other bags were either
[SPEAKER_02]: They would get confiscated coming from
Canada happened several times Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the hell did they even know that long
as a felony back making hash was a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: thing like five ten seconds and I sort of
can't get over how it's come around full
[SPEAKER_02]: scale now, you know There's big factories
making hash with Tables of people all
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing a butter and massive scale Yeah,
all in California all around the globe now
[SPEAKER_02]: these new states that are getting legal
We're getting calls from Oklahoma now and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got these Oklahoma's blowing hash
factories there Boston Chicago is going
[SPEAKER_00]: off the hook right now Well, Oklahoma is
amazing because they're like anybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to enter the cannabis game go for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they should It was $2,500 for a
license and then after the first year if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't live here, you can't get one So
you have to have residency so they like
[SPEAKER_01]: they let basically, you know free-for-all
for everybody and then After that and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like no only if you live here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buy a house or no Yeah, we're setting
up labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're helping people set labs up there
Like every week we get a new call from
[SPEAKER_02]: from a new company and now it's big it's
big management companies that are Involved
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a different market It's all corporate
now, that's what I don't like it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: corporation shouldn't be doing this and if
they are they should have people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing this for a long time at least
as some sort of consultant or allowing us
[SPEAKER_01]: to like Join that workforce allowing us to
pay our taxes allowing us to have a real
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate job We're working our asses
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're not sitting around like we're
not like weed dealers selling 20 bags We
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're not that we want to we want to
help people provide a service Like what's
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between us and some guy
that makes really good beer in his garage
[SPEAKER_01]: that opens up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Golden Road or 805 Brewery or
monk ish or any of those big high-end
[SPEAKER_01]: beers that were nobody they were all grown
in or made The craft market is still
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are we are craft cannabis in California
and that this is craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so niche There's not people that
are able to go spend, you know 60 70 80
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred and fifty dollars a grand lol cafe
Come on you have to be on vacation to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that Sort of shit can't smoke this stuff
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is gourmet shit right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so You were making and sorry
you said this was like up and humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh We're talking about making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something else people It was very
on the down low put it that way The mate
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash making hash up and humble
everywhere everywhere, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd come down to deliver bags to places in
Los Angeles different dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with dispensaries for 20
years and Helping them make the best hash
[SPEAKER_00]: what and what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the market in LA like 20 years
ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always explosive hashes made a
couple ups and downs and it's on its peak
[SPEAKER_02]: again right now But every like eight years
it goes up and down and popularity And
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and different kinds because shatter
was explosive for five minutes and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: like Dwindled out and now it's like more
of a back east thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of the shatter still
Available out there and then now
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's turning it to butter and it's
like wait When I used to make hash if your
[SPEAKER_01]: hash if you if your bh o turned to butter
it wasn't worth anything Now it's worth
[SPEAKER_01]: more like how does this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are what is going on with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean and this whole vaporizer thing just
smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's always it's always Just healthy
hash pills are good, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, if you want to take a 16-hour nap
I've had a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a couple where I'm like,
I'm like, what did you give me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Me ingesting marijuana is very different
than smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's if done, right with proper lechin and
proper mixing Medicine the most important
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is if I have friends that need this
medicine correct and They rely on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're they're in chemotherapy
right now and without these things their
[SPEAKER_02]: life is miserable miserable They're
spinning out of control on chemo madness
[SPEAKER_02]: roller coaster Throwing up and I'm so I
feel so bad for my friends, but they they
[SPEAKER_02]: need this product and it's really It's a
good thing that we can help people make
[SPEAKER_02]: this product with our bags and help people
we help people we teach them how to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it and We're always trying to develop the
best product possible and I love where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going I Really like to the few more
people having backyard groves doing little
[SPEAKER_01]: washes making their own that That's the
way it should be Just like people should
[SPEAKER_01]: be growing a little bit of vegetables in
their backyard, they should be having some
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes and maybe a chicken coop and if
you don't have the room for all of them
[SPEAKER_01]: you and your neighbor trade off and you
know what I mean like those little
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable things would go a long way
with the environment and It seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything wants to go big corporate big
money big lot like overboard It's like it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't need to be that way, especially
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to turn into a corporate
mongering and and a cash grab and a Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: Walgreens started out with cannabis and
they're finally coming back to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is wonderful Albeit there are very
different Walgreens today than they were a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah We have a lot of pharmaceutical
customers who are making amazing medicines
[SPEAKER_02]: with these products now with with cannabis
and Israel and all over the world Huge
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Israel is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm intrigued by the And I'm making making
it It's amazing the hash route the
[SPEAKER_02]: products that are coming out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have huge labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Couple buddies which is where
some of these strains came from they run a
[SPEAKER_01]: company called Smart V.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make the yeah the controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the indoor controllers They just went
to Israel and did a whole bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: They were there for like two weeks and
some of the videos that they were sending
[SPEAKER_01]: me I was like That's an Israel like that's
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it looks more sophisticated than
what's going on here And I was just blown
[SPEAKER_01]: away that they even had any type of weed
market Let alone these insane industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: labs going on like there was literally
like a girl in a lab coat I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell are you guys doing out
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad it's expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should expand throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There shouldn't be people Persecuted for
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely ridiculous It helps so
many more people than it hurts There's no
[SPEAKER_00]: question there's agreement all around on
that top we should have a toast you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: let's have a toast, you know Cheers,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's to the future of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it around bring it around You got to
try this The Mac one though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's utter gasoline all right,
so Staying on focus topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay on focus went so you you So you're up
and humbled making hash and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: Decided you wanted to make your own bags
and you had sisters who yeah, we have
[SPEAKER_02]: another we had another brand called trash
bags in the very big This is back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s They're called trash bags and you turn
your trash to cash and those were
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial strength bags Those were really
strong heavy-duty big huge 32 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be pulling big grapefruit size
softball size beautiful chunks out of
[SPEAKER_02]: their big oil balls at the end of the
bottom and They were just amazing and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone loved the bags and they just kind
of how are you guys drying it that long
[SPEAKER_01]: ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: We would make patties We make these cow
patties and we just put them out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun and we just age them out And now
freeze dryers are the way to roll of
[SPEAKER_01]: course, but I mean the four freeze dryers
I was washing I had my washing machine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and my technique was you know,
the pizza box technique, but I Had a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend that was like dude try printer
paper and I'm like, what are you talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like just lay out printer paper and
put the hash on the printer paper and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay you come back the next day and
the printer paper is soaked all the water
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the hash and it's all like warbly
and like well and the and the hash was
[SPEAKER_01]: like dry and I want to try that so you see
I feel like you the faster you're drying
[SPEAKER_01]: your hash the less time you have for
Oxidization so and always keep it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dark and it was coming out bomb back then
I mean we could pack it down, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: roll it like we'd I watched all the French
guys In Europe, you know rolling it with
[SPEAKER_01]: the cellophane with the hot water bottle
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is crazy We have a tray liner we make
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I just on the tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just come out with yeah if you go
on our website you can see them and They
[SPEAKER_02]: fit in the freeze dryers, but it's a
really good to sop up the water and it
[SPEAKER_02]: saves time also It's another development
and I heard even just freezing it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: microplaning it and that's something I
didn't know about until recent getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into this after I'd already Sorry,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like just I get you focus and you
start talking after after you get your
[SPEAKER_01]: tripod proper tripod one day It seems like
as I've gotten into this I go way
[SPEAKER_01]: overboard with my research and looking up
stupid stuff and trolling people on the
[SPEAKER_01]: and not trolling people like just I guess
just following stocking stalking people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just not talking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not talking shit, but I'm just
following any information that I can find
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like the the amount of
techniques that are out there I just I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know and I thought I knew it all
you know what I mean, and it seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: people are doing so many different things
and it's so cool that we have the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: we have Instagram and we have the kind of
social acceptance that's slowly seeping
[SPEAKER_01]: out and you know more and more people are
doing this so before just like just let
[SPEAKER_01]: them do their thing and leave them alone,
they're not hurting nobody, you know kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of and The techniques like I said the
microplaning the freezing it You just tell
[SPEAKER_01]: them you set it out in the Sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that's the coolest thing we used
to give directions in the very very
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning And we'd put instructions in the
bags and it would say lavender making so
[SPEAKER_02]: we'd say how to make lavender and
extractions and we just Do you know
[SPEAKER_02]: explain how to do it or we'd say exactly
what not to do Do not do this do not do
[SPEAKER_00]: that do not do that for the lavender
essence making fans out there This bag is
[SPEAKER_00]: for you now and now we're also dedicated
about lavender essence making we might
[SPEAKER_02]: switch it up to eucalyptus next week,
but I love how Legalization has helped us
[SPEAKER_02]: expand and really develop new technology
It's helped us take things forward to a
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're like up here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like miles ahead Yeah, when I first
heard like Oh hair straightener and
[SPEAKER_01]: squishing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not gonna happen You can't just
squeeze oil out of home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the craziest thing I've ever
heard and I'm like, oh now I'm squeezing
[SPEAKER_01]: really expensive bubble hash and it's it's
did the first Time you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nerve-wracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if you're gonna lose money
if you're gonna, you know, like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna ruin somebody's crop You're gonna
you know, it's like so nerve-wracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh my god, like this is Yeah,
there's a lot of emotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's and there's Everybody just told me
just get your hands dirty get out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I could tell you a million things I
could tell you wasn't that like when
[SPEAKER_00]: people first started dropping this in the
water other people were like
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I went to Amsterdam 2004 and he
dumped it in the bucket and everybody lost
[SPEAKER_01]: their mind and it was in a huge warehouse
the bubble man the actual bubble bags that
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's like a goofy look from I
think he's from isn't he from Humboldt or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he Canadian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I didn't even know but you know
the the really nice the the velvet yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: bag with the little shoulder strap he
walked in with that and nobody had seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: yet and he did it right There in the
warehouse right at the like right across
[SPEAKER_01]: the street from the milk wag and this was
like in 2004 I'm like, there's no way this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy's gonna make DNA was there for the
first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were kids man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a kid I was like 21 well Mila just
told me that when she was first selling
[SPEAKER_00]: her bags Like they were you know She had a
booth at some event and they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging like with you know clothesline
clips and people would just kind of walk
[SPEAKER_00]: by and be like Okay, like what the hell
She's been selling bags and then I think
[SPEAKER_00]: what was it Soma Soma seeds the old man
Started giving them some love and people
[SPEAKER_00]: were like what what do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like this is what you do with
them and they were like But it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: around for 2,000 years in China.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean if you do the research it's been
around water thousands of years Even back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Egyptian days they have these times
that they're saying like make yourself a
[SPEAKER_02]: genius.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to eat it They'd say have genius
days and eat hashish and they used to have
[SPEAKER_02]: hash pills that they would take back in
the Egyptian times The Pharaohs loved hash
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to the Pharaohs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was good But wait,
but but I've always heard that like nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of adding water until like 20 30
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been they've been doing you know,
there's definitely been and and when I
[SPEAKER_01]: found out like BHO was made like 50 years
ago like some of the first BHO was early
[SPEAKER_01]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like what like why didn't we know
about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember growing up and eat her like
Honey oil or something and it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled like patchouli oil or something
that you were smoking It wasn't wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even good like maple syrup or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were smoking I didn't know what the
hell was smoking with us 18, but I just
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just so glad it's it's progressed so
far to this and obviously it's healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no there's no question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the like innovations that
you're both seeing now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like over the past year or two or the
majors like is anyone posting stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a consistency or a device or
a product that helps make it that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh fuck Yeah, the only thing that
really changed the game over recent is the
[SPEAKER_01]: free shower I mean, I I mean the bags are
always fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense You get what you pay for you're
not if you don't pay good money you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get a crappy Sew job, it's gonna
come apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I've seen these things that you're
right five rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the right strain Preferably a nice
full-term strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and then you got to have the right
process and you have those together and
[SPEAKER_01]: the right cure job people don't even get
the mix of the of the water and ice right
[SPEAKER_00]: so That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so what is your mix is your mix of
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no there is no like that you will
never know like oh I want four gallons of
[SPEAKER_01]: water for Ten pounds of ice or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no mix like that You feel it when
you're doing this and you've done this for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time and you're mixing it by hand
You know that feel there's a sound there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a sound You know when it's those those ice
cubes are breaking the heads off and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's crushing through that weed
properly Without releasing a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of chlorophyll so you don't have
green hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like lawnmower It doesn't sound
like well, I'm sorry about the lawnmower
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the gardeners gotta roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good But you know, yeah totally I
mean like all around like when we first
[SPEAKER_02]: started we'd be using buckets and and
paddles like little canoe paddles and You
[SPEAKER_02]: just want to just agitate ever so
slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm ever so slightly just I I have a
very The guy who helps me mostly I have an
[SPEAKER_01]: assistant nobody can do this one-handed by
themselves except for cannabis cameras
[SPEAKER_01]: That kid does everything by himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will not let anybody in his room.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will not let anybody anywhere He
doesn't let anybody touch his crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't I was like he's like a ran man
He's like not only am I amazing at making
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, but I also grow amazing living soil
weed So I cultivate and I'm like also
[SPEAKER_00]: mastering that craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's no joke, dude He's like a guitar
player than me like and I dabble in the
[SPEAKER_01]: piano a little bit and just being like And
you're like And and he's super like quiet
[SPEAKER_01]: and humble and it's weird I met him
skinboarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're like, hey fellas skin border
Like what do you like to do when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not skin boarding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like well, I go skin boarding I'm

[SPEAKER_01]: you know or whatever and he's like no man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's you know and then was this over
Instagram No, like if you skin board,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably like 20 of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not very many places you can
actually skin Board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you like to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Skinboarding here is done mostly in Malibu
and north like as soon as you get north of
[SPEAKER_01]: County line And is that cuz you have like
when like high tide to look?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh cuz it's the deepest beach and you
always go like about an hour before high
[SPEAKER_01]: tide Okay, and it's clutch but the skin
board Mecca of the world is Laguna Beach
[SPEAKER_01]: and that'll never ever change never ever
change It's the way the beaches are set up
[SPEAKER_01]: every beach around there breaks perfect
The only one that like is out of Laguna
[SPEAKER_01]: Beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's awesome is the wedge and
that's very finicky so but it here is the
[SPEAKER_01]: skin boarding Mecca just like here is the
Mecca of Boutique weed and the stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you just don't go for a lot of things I
went to Amsterdam so many times you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: find weed like you can find weed here It
doesn't exist it you go to you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all got it legal You can't grow weed
like you can grow weed here specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: because of elevation You can't grow bomb
ass weed over 5,000 feet elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble's got the same exact kind of
climate like they have in the hills of
[SPEAKER_02]: Istanbul and up in the hills of
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same kind of climate same exactly
Humble is built perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes very much for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little colder, but for outdoors
weed loves cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, yeah, but you can't grow in
January Humble, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't here and the indoor that
comes from here is Unreal it's so I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: I've searched can't dispute that search.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could find better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddies are growing some good weed down
here Well, how about this of the indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: you like like is it grown in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it grown hydro is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: In all reality I've had every single way
grown and enjoy all those and have every
[SPEAKER_01]: single way, you know cocoa soil Hydro if
it's indoor and it's grown in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, it's gonna be better than
anywhere else I don't care what he says if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it the same way if there's no
possible way it could come out better just
[SPEAKER_00]: geographical it's Geography matters with
indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, absolutely 100% anybody who says
that that your indoor is Not determined by
[SPEAKER_01]: your outside factors is wrong your indoor
No matter how sealed your room is you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't seal you can't make pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't make Atmospheric pressure you
can't if it's if the Santa Ana's are out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the valley Your weed will drop dry way
slower than it would if it was raining
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's indoor it changes
There is a difference from growing it
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere in the world then growing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I totally you don't
believe me Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not be indoor here indoor there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's I still do you do you not agree
with me that outside factors will always
[SPEAKER_00]: are they well, but Control less less like
like like elevation barometric pressure or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever like Certain things will have a
factor but other things you can't say so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having fewer things that are out of
or that are micro climate dependent Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I'm telling you is the fact that
you don't have to actually put any effort
[SPEAKER_01]: into having the perfect parameters,
which is what is Here which is through a
[SPEAKER_01]: bee In perfectly in another area You have
to keep it so dialed in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do anything That's why
it always comes out better is this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: optimum Everything's optimum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to have huge skill level
and you'll still do you still need some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of Playing with an oversized tennis
racket or something what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain to you is spots much bigger Let's
just say you're taking one factor of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one factor of it Just humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay one factor of humidity Okay The
humidity levels here where we live growing
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor is way easier to combat and to deal
with with one freaking dehumidifier Than
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be anywhere else in the country
to grow pot in Florida in the summer dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: Minnesota Okay, anywhere you're gonna go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be more human.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have harder Chance to do
things you have to be humble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very humid or even more dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go to the Bay Area The Bay Area
has got a great climate, but still you're
[SPEAKER_02]: still saying California fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still saying California I will I
will agree with you from from roughly like
[SPEAKER_01]: like Arcata To San Diego is the greatest
and you can't go very far inland either
[SPEAKER_01]: the further you go inland the least the
Worst you go kind of around that bend
[SPEAKER_00]: globally and find other spots that are
kind of Similar like as they say exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: on the other side of the the map is at the
Afghani mountains and those regions So so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why it does grow there also,
but it's not the same topography It's
[SPEAKER_01]: topography ocean the way the the way the
freaking currents right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all that BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, do they just do you see the hemp
that's planted?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even water it They don't water
that in Camarillo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows like wild And it looks like crazy
you're like
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been down here It stinks you're
driving on the freeway you're like and
[SPEAKER_01]: There's and there's weed like all along
the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just walk up and grab a plant They
don't even care.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy Yeah, it literally and they
said they barely water it due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: geographical area where it is and how much
ocean You know Mist and all that overcast
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in they barely water it And they're
and they're and they're harvesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're harvesting this massive amount of
hemp and getting a huge amount of money
[SPEAKER_01]: for it And now they don't have to water
their crops like they were watering You
[SPEAKER_01]: know the peppers and the in the in the
cabbage and whatever else that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing They've just legalized it up in
Humboldt County to and for a hemp for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the farmers aren't too happy about
it All my friends are very not happy about
[SPEAKER_02]: it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact Sure, man, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing is just by the way I
did it like a two and a half hour
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with cam and him and Fred had
like these amazing like Thirst quenching
[SPEAKER_00]: drinks and I realized as we started
filming that I had no water or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got super high So for two and a half
hours, I had nothing to drink while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so they're growing hemp up in Humboldt now
finally it's been on a moratorium for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time They were not allowing it But
where they're doing it is in all the
[SPEAKER_02]: farmland in the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got different hemp zones and well,
I saw something recently posted like
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt now is gonna have more cannabis
licenses than Santa Barbara and more
[SPEAKER_00]: Acreage of cultivation and I was like say
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cuz Santa Barbara is the biggest
right now Yeah, by by by like multiples of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like did something just happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Local regulatory wise that changed or
well, they had this moratorium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with cultivation in
Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I Got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry Yeah, they're I like the
building opportunities the sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: building opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should build building
materials Fuel out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I think hemp should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited about that Yeah,
I think you know The plastics and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that they build with hemp is the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're building houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing all sorts of crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well the kind of the infrastructure
to get stuff from raw material not raw
[SPEAKER_00]: like petroleum has how many years of
creating Equipment and processes to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: every form factor of biomaterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous the amount of Trash and
waste we have I can't even know some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the work I'd love to start like I want to
start reaching out to see who makes just
[SPEAKER_00]: like hemp fabrics I want to start playing
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are really nice hemp Patagonia pants
But where could you get like just the
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what I like working you buy
raw fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and make your own brand Yeah And I'm
pretty sure living in LA you can go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: garment district and you can find People
that can get that for you for sure But
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so how about cannabis cultivation
Humboldt County snapshot in time November
[SPEAKER_00]: so people have harvested they're curing

lowest year right 2017 into 2018,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then but he was Just because of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it didn't matter whether it was
indoor outdoor up north beautiful weed

massive hit like Indoors usually like
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,500 and then it dropped to like 16 1700
dollars for beautiful pot Beautiful and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the outdoors were going for like 500
600 dollars like that were decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane Just now it's finally going
back up for sure.
