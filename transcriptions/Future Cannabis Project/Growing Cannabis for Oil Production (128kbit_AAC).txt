[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit what terpene profile
you put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the same as a cannabis derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get the complexity straight and
you can't get the ratio straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately the experience is
diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we realized was that if we put in
commercial level terp stripping
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, I can then have farmers who
have locations that are optimal for higher
[SPEAKER_00]: quality do my crude production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can have farms that have better
situations to do my terp production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take your cannabis,
I pull the terps, the rest of the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: gets blown as crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way you make crude money,
you make terp money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terps now can get infused with the
crude from others because you're having a
[SPEAKER_00]: radical amount of product that can be
created from terpene infusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it starts to let me find,
how do we stabilize markets?
