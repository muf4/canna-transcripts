[SPEAKER_00]: our keynote panel, which focuses on the
proposed cannabis appellation program
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leading that discussion tonight will
be Janine Coleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Janine Coleman is the founder and
executive director of Origins Council,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nonprofit education research and policy
advocacy organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go ahead and get started
and just offer a brief overview of the
[SPEAKER_04]: proposed regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll open up into the more
specific topics for discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, the regulatory package
describes a system to establish an
[SPEAKER_04]: appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that process is that farmers come
together to research and develop a
[SPEAKER_04]: petition to propose an appellation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the regulations propose a minimum of
three licensed cultivators come together
[SPEAKER_04]: to do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the petition describes the
geographic boundaries of their proposed
[SPEAKER_04]: appellation, evidence of established name
use, and geographic factors that
[SPEAKER_04]: contribute to the unique qualities of the
cannabis and the cannabis cultivation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then any region-specific standards,
practices, and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the petition submitted to CDFA for
review, along with a fee of $20,880.
[SPEAKER_04]: And CDFA proposes in the regulations to
appoint a volunteer review panel
[SPEAKER_04]: consisting of seven members with two
alternates to review the petition and
[SPEAKER_04]: provide recommendations to CDFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once the petition is determined to be
complete, CDFA will notice a 30-day public
[SPEAKER_04]: comment period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And CDFA has the sole authority to approve
the appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appellation petitions, once established,
can be amended.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the proposed fee for that is $10,440.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of other considerations in the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit unclear whether or not
the appellation can be used on
[SPEAKER_04]: manufactured products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a point of clarification we're
gonna be looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no labeling guidelines that are
provided.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another pretty significant scope
of clarification that we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regulations propose allowing for
partially overlapping appellations as well
[SPEAKER_04]: as nested appellations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Richard spoke a little bit about the
potential friction between trademarks and
[SPEAKER_04]: appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the regulations propose a three-year
sunset period for geographic trademarks
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be in conflict with an
appellation of origin with that timeline
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning once the appellation of origin
has been established.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the verification and enforcement side
of things, the proposal is to essentially
[SPEAKER_04]: handle those requirements solely through
record keeping.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fines for misuse are very
minor and range from $100 to $500.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just a general picture of the
regulatory package.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think to start us off, what I would
like to do is ask Richard if you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: mind walking us through the specific
petition requirements and explain how that
[SPEAKER_04]: is important with respect to the causal
link.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these proposed regulations,
they're in the California Code of
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulations, Title III, Division 8,
Chapter 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically the requirements for a
petition are in sections 9102 to 9107.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just review that briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the general information is
set forth in 9102.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to describe who you are,
your license number, contact information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to give a general description of
the area, which would be the total
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage, the acreage under canopy,
and the acreage of that total,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount which would qualify for use of
the appellation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give them the sense of proportion at
the outset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get into the specifics that
are going to look a lot like what I showed
[SPEAKER_01]: you for an AVA with one notable exception,
name, boundary, distinctive geographical
[SPEAKER_01]: features, all of which looks like an AVA,
style requirements, and then your
[SPEAKER_01]: standards practices and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's run through those specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regs give some guidance into the types
of information that would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, all of this is subject to
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: by CDFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will tell you, just as TPB tells
you with an AVA petition, whether you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: quote unquote, perfected, whether you've
met the original evidentiary burden in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get yourself into rulemaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name in 9104 is pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name has to relate to the boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say in the regs whether the
name can be under-inclusive or
[SPEAKER_01]: over-inclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says that you can use numerous
information sources to justify the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name doesn't have to be a name
that's been known in the world of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: or for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name can be a governmental name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a school district.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a mountain name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be the names of businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be in the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used in tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the petitioners will have to do is
to bring all of those sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: information together in their petition to
justify that the name applies to the given
[SPEAKER_01]: boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, even though it's not stated in
the regulations, if the name is
[SPEAKER_01]: misleading, if I were sitting here in Napa
and calling myself Berkeley, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: a consumer is not going to understand
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no matter what information I adduce,
so the name has to be understandable to
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go to 9105, which is the
boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a narrative description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it looks a lot like the TTB rules
for AVA's.
[SPEAKER_01]: You describe it in a clockwise manner,
starting at the beginning point,
[SPEAKER_01]: going clockwise, and ending at the same
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use any features that appear
on a map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they give you examples of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be human features, human
construction features, like a bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be natural features, like an
elevation, or a mountain peak,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a road, or a river.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not say, but I presume it means,
the regulations mean, that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this by parcel lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my property, but not my
neighbor's property, as defined in meets
[SPEAKER_01]: and bounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think it looks pretty much
like the same kind of information that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would do for an AVA petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 9106, we get to the most interesting
part of the regulations and where the
[SPEAKER_01]: causal link comes in, Janine, and that is
the issue of what they call distinctive
[SPEAKER_01]: geographical features in the regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And geographical features, it's stated in
the initial statement of reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: include cultural factors and reputational
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bringing in what they call
anthropogenic features, cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's geographical features in the
broadest sense of the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they ask for those features that
affect cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally have a problem with that
because it should be that affects
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, not that affects cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The test of any GI or Appalachian origin
is the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you grow it is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a standard practice in cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, the geographical features
have to relate, and this is your causal
[SPEAKER_01]: link, to the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's a natural feature,
as they call out here, climate,
[SPEAKER_01]: physical features, elevations,
geology, no mention of soil, which should
[SPEAKER_01]: be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how it relates to the final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also include reputation,
history of the area, cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is that you have to
show not just that the region is
[SPEAKER_01]: distinctive compared to what's outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to show that what makes it
distinctive affects the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add up the sum total of the
geography, the geographical features,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the standards practices in cultivars,
that that equation will lead to those
[SPEAKER_01]: special distinctive characteristics and
qualities of the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the burden of the petitioners to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the petitioners, three or more,
are going to get together and collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we prove this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That our cannabis really is distinctive in
this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, they want you to
enumerate what those standards practices
[SPEAKER_01]: and cultivars are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, the practice can be a
prohibited practice as well as a
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptive practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultivar can be a prohibited cultivar
as well as an allowable cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says this directly in the regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practices, of course, they don't say it,
but maybe they would be the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: either those you can do or those you can't
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interestingly, it works both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could, for example, if you're not
ready to specify a cultivar or cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could say it won't be these cultivars
and you won't be farming in this manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be negative as well as positive
in terms of those standards practices and
[SPEAKER_01]: the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you have to have the record
keeping them to show them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main thing, I think, the main
burden, names and boundaries are
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main burden is going to be the causal
link between the geographical features
[SPEAKER_01]: writ large and the final cannabis product
and all the standards practices and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar prescriptions that go along with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Richard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a good segue to discuss
terroir.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a topic that the farming
community has been talking about for
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Heather, I know this is something that
you've been working on as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you speak to the issue of terroir
and how it relates to the program and the
[SPEAKER_04]: causal link?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terroir is really an important concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a French term.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been translated as the taste of
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a lot more complex than
just the taste of place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this whole concept of the
environmental factors that affect the
[SPEAKER_03]: product, what my friend and scientist
Holly Hall called the biophysical factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the climate, the soil, the way the fog
rolls in and how that affects the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But additionally, also the human factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the ways that humans have
interacted with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Terroir is generally through an
agricultural lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how the humans have worked with the
environment in that agricultural practice
[SPEAKER_03]: or in that agricultural, what am I trying
to say, in that area of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for cannabis, for instance,
the way that we have interacted with the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant has been under a cloud of
prohibition for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have this opportunity through
the statute to codify essentially,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a codification and regulation
anyways, the standards that we have used
[SPEAKER_03]: under this cloud of prohibition for so
long to cultivate the plant in our
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern California and our legacy
producing hills.
[SPEAKER_03]: The practices that we've employed.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the traditional practices?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are the cultivars that grow in
certain ways?
[SPEAKER_03]: And those human interactions with just the
regular cultivation of the plant together
[SPEAKER_03]: that allows us in California cannabis to
enact the program that is terroir based,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is linked to the, the product is
linked to the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the link between product and place,
those are generally governed in law by
[SPEAKER_03]: Appalachians of Origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Appalachian of Origins will,
like I said, codify those links into the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the causal link there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how comes why the product expresses
the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because of the causation there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really exciting in California
cannabis law because we have this
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to do so, to link the product
to the place using the, using these causal
[SPEAKER_03]: links through standards, practices,
varieties of our geographical features.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a really exciting opportunity
that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the regulations, I think, set us up
to, to be able to do that, except for they
[SPEAKER_03]: do include this reputational evidence as
well, which Richard talked about earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have two different ways that we
can codify or two different sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: applications of law that we could use to,
to codify the causal links.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one comes from the Lisbon Agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is an exclusive or essential,
the product is exclusively or essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: linked to its geographical source.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a much higher standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas we could have one where the
reputation is linked to the place and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a lower standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm kind of excited to see what we
can do here through our draft regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: with CDFA to see if we can push towards a
more terroir-based application that
[SPEAKER_03]: includes the human and the geographical
factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that that's so important is
because terroir-based applications have a
[SPEAKER_03]: higher value in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers understand that when something,
when a program, like an applications
[SPEAKER_03]: program, when that can ensure to the
consumer that not only does it come from a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular place, but that the standards
that are used or the practices that are
[SPEAKER_03]: used or the particular cultivars that are
used are also set forth in that same or
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled under that same program,
the consumers can have a heightened trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we trust the product more,
we're more willing to buy or pay a premium
[SPEAKER_03]: price for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's shown in all sorts of consumer
studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the higher price that we can fetch when
we have greater controls over the
[SPEAKER_03]: appellation by using a terroir-based,
a geographic and human-controlled type of
[SPEAKER_03]: program, that money then goes back to the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that farmer then spends the money
locally and we have then increased
[SPEAKER_03]: economic ability for our farms and for the
communities that have a terroir-based
[SPEAKER_03]: appellation program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a ton of other reasons why the
terroir-based appellations program,
[SPEAKER_03]: one that has the heightened controls,
is good for our communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the other reasons, in addition
to consumer confidence and therefore
[SPEAKER_03]: higher brand value, higher economic
opportunity for the farmer and for the
[SPEAKER_03]: community, is also that the codification
in regulation of our practices and what
[SPEAKER_03]: we've been doing in the hills for so long
that allows us to protect it in a way that
[SPEAKER_03]: if someone from Big Ag wants to come in
and say, this is hand-trimmed or this
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is produced in a certain way,
that there is at least some reference to
[SPEAKER_03]: what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gonna be harder for somebody to
take that type of practice and to co-opt
[SPEAKER_03]: it into Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other exciting thing about that is by
keeping all this stuff local, we can work
[SPEAKER_03]: together to have a more regenerative
business model and that can work to reduce
[SPEAKER_03]: the global supply chain right now that is
causing so many farmers and other
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural industries to just be
squeezed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of the contract farmers,
it's like essentially in some ways a new
[SPEAKER_03]: form of indentured servitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the fact that we can keep our
value, we can tell our story our own way,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can manage how our story is pulled out
into in other ways, I mean in other
[SPEAKER_03]: industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that it's not co-opted,
it's a really exciting opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have that right now in a way that
wine doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wine, AVA, the American Viticulture
Association do not regulate in a really
[SPEAKER_03]: strong, meaningful way standards,
practices or cultivars, but cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to lose it and not use it right now
when we're set up and teed up in such a
[SPEAKER_03]: great way would be I think a
disappointment to the work that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: done so far to get us to this point where
we are teed up in that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good for the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good for communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really hoping and praying that we
do have a terror war based program that's
[SPEAKER_03]: enacted here in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks Heather.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to key in on something that you
really brought to the fore, which is the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer trust and consumer loyalty,
because that is effectively how we can
[SPEAKER_04]: leverage this tool in the market and bring
those deliverables back to our producing
[SPEAKER_04]: communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we've been researching and meeting and
discussing this and thinking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: program, we're gonna try and look through
the eye of the consumer and ask ourselves
[SPEAKER_04]: how we can reach them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the tools that we have?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one of the most powerful tools
that's not spoken to in the regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think certainly there's gonna be a
lot of comment coming forward is the
[SPEAKER_04]: concept of an official seal, an
authenticating seal, a logo that lives on
[SPEAKER_04]: the product and really represents this
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a standardized seal and Omar,
I know you've done a lot of research and
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking and looking into this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'd love to hear your thoughts
about what you would like to see happen
[SPEAKER_04]: along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see an official seal that
the state of California adopts and the
[SPEAKER_02]: official seal will be an emblem of
authenticity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will provide consumers with helpful
information about the origin of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and the requirements associated
with California cannabis appellations,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are requirements for practices,
standards, or culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it to be something that's
consistent and easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the European Union, there's
something like this, and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: Denominazione De Origine Proteta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is for like cheese and other
types of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like a nice identifiable seal
that consumers can, without knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: anything about the particular product,
they can see the identifying seal and see
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's a designation of origin that is
protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is basically like a proxy for
quality for consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will assist consumers in
differentiating among products in a very
[SPEAKER_02]: crowded marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we have in mind would be
something kind of like the here's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: DOC seal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there will be like a uniform design
element.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ring on the outside would state
official California cannabis appellation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the area on the inside would have
the name of the appellation as well as a
[SPEAKER_02]: unique design that would give petitioners
artistic leeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be like a cool seal, whatever the
proposal the petitioners come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the main benefit to having an official
seal is that individual appellation,
[SPEAKER_02]: the licensees are the ones who benefit
from the appellations, they would be
[SPEAKER_02]: relieved of being solely responsible for
enforcement and monitoring costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state would be incentivized to make
sure that the official seals are not
[SPEAKER_02]: misused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically it would give the state
of California some skin in the game in
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting appellations.
[SPEAKER_02]: The system that has been currently
proposed does not really, and partly
[SPEAKER_02]: because it can't, but the regulators can't
impose criminal penalties on those who are
[SPEAKER_02]: not subject to their regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cannot forbid the use of these seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this would be something that
would really like, number one,
[SPEAKER_02]: help consumers identify official
California cannabis appellations and
[SPEAKER_02]: thereby make appellations more valuable
and more recognizable, more uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's something that we had
identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at the examples of other parts
of the world, we don't really need to
[SPEAKER_02]: reinvent the wheel because people have
really, this is what works in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's something that would work
here in California and that would probably
[SPEAKER_02]: spread out throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's a great idea,
Omar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to mention, we've been talking
about applying that concept also to County
[SPEAKER_04]: of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got the two tools for geographic
indications for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the County of Origin and the
Appellation of Origin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in both cases, particularly
the opportunity for conjunctive labeling,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're identifying that county area
and then perhaps an appellation within
[SPEAKER_04]: that county area, I think that would be
really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these could identify a county and
the other one could be like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Appellation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think you spoke a little bit
too, that could be another opportunity to
[SPEAKER_04]: look at funding and fee structures and how
we tackle the cost of the program and the
[SPEAKER_04]: cost to petitioners.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the first reactions and strongest
reactions we've gotten from farmers taking
[SPEAKER_04]: a look at the regulations is concern over
the proposed fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So $20,000 to file a petition,
$10,000 to amend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's our understanding that part of
why it's structured that way is the agency
[SPEAKER_04]: really needs the fees to fund the program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've all been discussing various
ideas about how to spread those costs out
[SPEAKER_04]: and lower the barriers to entry for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just want to open it up to the
group to discuss this and bring forward
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the ideas that I've been hearing
about how to really tackle that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I could take the lead, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: The barriers to entry are extremely high,
like $20,000 for a petition to establish
[SPEAKER_02]: and $10,000 for a renewal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is predicated on the idea
that they're gonna get these fees one time
[SPEAKER_02]: up front and this will fund the
Appellations program forever,
[SPEAKER_02]: indefinitely, in perpetuity, which is an
insane way to fund the program because it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really account for enforcement and
it doesn't account for maintaining a
[SPEAKER_02]: viable, thriving program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're thinking is instead of
creating such a high initial barrier to
[SPEAKER_02]: entry by having a one-time fee to
establish an Appalachian and no other
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue sources, why don't we think of new
ways to bring in revenue to lower the
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier to entry?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I've heard from some struggling
farmers in the Tonkei region of Mendocino
[SPEAKER_02]: County, they're thinking, why should we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should we have to pay anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why shouldn't the state be paying for the
cannabis Appalachian program, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should this be a burden that those who
are proposing Appalachians have to bear?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're gonna assume for the sake of
argument that this must be a revenue
[SPEAKER_02]: neutral endeavor, then there's ways to
lower the barriers to entry significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's by requiring renewal fees every
10 years once an Appalachian is
[SPEAKER_02]: established.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of charging $20,000 upfront
forever and never, charge $10,000 upfront
[SPEAKER_02]: and every 10 years charge another $10,000
and that will maintain a viable
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachians program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also thinking that use of the
proposed seal or seals would be subject to
[SPEAKER_02]: a modest royalty and that would
incentivize official enforcement against
[SPEAKER_02]: misuse because now the state doesn't want
anybody stealing their tax money with
[SPEAKER_02]: these fake seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's other proposals that
I'll lead to my co-panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just a couple of points I agree with
everything you said Omar and Heather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just first of all, the fee for filing an
AVA is zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, just so we know by comparison,
the federal government does not charge a
[SPEAKER_01]: fee for filing a petition nor does it
require as these proposals do the users of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Appalachian to file a notice of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the notice of use of who's using an
Appalachian is another funding potential
[SPEAKER_01]: funding mechanism because particularly if
the cannabis is used by not just
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators, but manufactured products or
other manufacturers or others,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would contribute to the funding and
the enforcement of the program as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part of it, $20,000 is a lot of money
because you have to pay experts as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they calculated in the financial
section, which wasn't distributed online,
[SPEAKER_01]: but is available, cost-benefit analysis
that between hiring experts and paying
[SPEAKER_01]: this fee that you're going to be close to
70, 80, $100,000 by the time you get done
[SPEAKER_01]: with an Appalachian of origin,
that's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it particularly troublesome that
there's a fee of half, 10,000 whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: change to make an amendment because in
fact, amendments will probably be routine
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not thinking of amendments of the
boundary or the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of the amendments of the
standards practices and cultivars once the
[SPEAKER_01]: group, the petitioning group and all the
people inside the area start working with
[SPEAKER_01]: one another and they come up with new
ideas and they gain consensus on new
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: New standards, there should be numerous
amendments and those should not be
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those should be free or very minimal cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Richard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think such a salient point because the
amendment process is going to allow
[SPEAKER_04]: innovation to move forward and you spoke
to that tension between innovation and
[SPEAKER_04]: tradition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think also it helps inform the
development of the program because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: through that amendment process that we're
going to learn and grow and really develop
[SPEAKER_04]: on a community side, on the Appalachian
side and on the program itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Blake, I see you've joined us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have reappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to jump in because we've received
some very excellent on point questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to subject you guys to.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the note that we were just talking
about, the first question I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from Matthew Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's asking, if wine took hundreds of
years to create Appalachians, is there a
[SPEAKER_00]: risk that creating Appalachians for
cannabis that it's too early in the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: process of cannabis coming to
legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we building this grand edifice that's
not going to actually do anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it actually going to, amending these
things, is that going to help?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see in terms of the efficacy
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I may, I'll just start this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anytime you have a product that's
already well known, you better do your
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian program sooner rather than
later, or you'll have so many knockoffs
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that your Appalachians will
never be meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the same token Blake, while I think the
Appalachians should start now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having any three petitioners
decide on an Appalachian may be too few
[SPEAKER_01]: and lead to a rush to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want mine and another three people want
theirs, particularly if they allow
[SPEAKER_01]: partially overlapping Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are trying to receive
CLE credit, there is the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, continue Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just the last point is I think
requiring more consensus before people
[SPEAKER_01]: come in to file would be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a whole consensus building
process amongst the people inside an
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian before they file rather than
everybody wanting to get their names
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think CDFA estimated there would be 10
new Appalachians a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was in their cost benefit
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do them well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first ones are really important to
establish some precedent here about the
[SPEAKER_01]: causal link and let's go slow,
but let's start now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to add to that, I totally agree with
what Richard's saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we're hoping is to
see federal and international walls fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do hold off, not only will there be
so many knockoffs and copycats,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think Northern California and our
legacy cannabis producing regions will
[SPEAKER_03]: lose a significant opportunity to define
what the program could look like that
[SPEAKER_03]: could then be emulated around the globe as
these foreign walls do hopefully fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they're expected to do so in
the coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually leads to another good
question that we received from one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: viewers from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a longer question,
but the gist of it is, how do you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: California Appalachian program meshing
with other states and potentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a test case, a little incubator
where we test out the system and then
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe put it forth at the federal level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we looking to see how other states use
it as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see this program maybe as an
exemplar for others or something to that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say as goes California,
so goes the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the biggest laboratories of
democracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The experiments in California tend to
propagate across the whole United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Massachusetts, it's already thinking,
how are they doing Appalachians in
[SPEAKER_02]: California?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that portends well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our organization has been so laser focused
on the policy because we are setting a
[SPEAKER_04]: precedent here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have other states watching this very
closely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Oregon and Washington are
looking at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica is looking at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are legacy cannabis producing
regions all over the world that are in a
[SPEAKER_04]: very prescient moment right now in terms
of legalization unfolding internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such a tremendous mechanism to
protect traditional producing communities
[SPEAKER_04]: and their genetic property, their
intellectual property, their traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely think that this is a very
pivotal moment and getting this policy
[SPEAKER_04]: right means everything for those
communities worldwide just because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: precedent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should cut off in a moment,
but I do have one more question that has
[SPEAKER_00]: come up a bit and some of the questions
that have arisen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the petition process, I think it's
9-102, the petitioner is supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: specify the license types for the
cultivation license types that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian would apply to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That particular section allows for all
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could list mixed indoor-outdoor
cultivation as part of the Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's unclear how some of the
other requirements would allow for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators to be a part of an
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if any of you had thought
about that or how you think that indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators or people who are using bagged
soils, how that would play into this new
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, or no soil at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: My view about that, you're right and thank
you for pointing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever asked that question, I should have
made that clear at the outset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the petition is to say which
license types are allowed to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, if we're talking about a
terroir-based Appalachian system,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be in a causal link between the
natural environment, not an indoor-created
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a mockery to have an indoor
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess one could claim that the
reputation has been developed in a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: region, but if we're talking about
terroir, then it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fewer interferences between the
natural environment or manipulations or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call them and the
final product is a more true and integral
[SPEAKER_01]: and comprehensive and understandable
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're working for right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess since Chris isn't stopping me,
I think I get to pick another question
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other questions I thought was
interesting, this comes from Amy King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the terroir-based system set too high
of a standard for people who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish an Appalachian or take advantage
of the protections and the opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: that come with an Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too prohibitive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it create too much tension,
going back to Richard's presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much tension between standards and
traditions of old and then innovation?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to just make two quick comments on
that and then I'll pass it off to somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it more eloquently than I
can, but one, I think that it's not too
[SPEAKER_03]: strict.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers respond to those strict controls
and will pay a higher price for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the stricter the controls,
the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think that the terroir-based
program is going to be more defensible if
[SPEAKER_03]: challenged.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't prove your causal link
because you don't have one because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not terroir-based, then how are you going
to defend it upon challenge?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very elegantly stated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'd like to add- I'm actually
going to have to cut you off there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want one final note, Janine,
and then we need to shift off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just wanted to point out again
that we've got two tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got county of origin, which is all
inclusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no additional standards on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's open to all operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we've got Appalachian of origin.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a balance there between
inclusivity and exclusivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's often set to the side and
not really a part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really an important piece
to address that concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure hearing all of you talk
about the new system because it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got elements of the AOC where we've
got standards, practice, and cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also leaving a little bit of room
because it is so new for the innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our keynote panel, which focuses on
the proposed cannabis Appalachian program
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading that discussion tonight will be
Janine Coleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Janine Coleman is the founder and
executive director of Origins Council,
[SPEAKER_00]: a non-profit education, research,
and policy advocacy organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Origins Council is dedicated to
sustainable rural economic development
[SPEAKER_00]: within legacy cannabis, producing regions
and establishing nationally and
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally recognized legally
defensible standard-based geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: indication systems for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Janine lives in Mendocino County and has
over 20 years of cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, she stopped cultivating cannabis
to take up cannabis patient and policy
[SPEAKER_00]: advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the co-founder of the Mendocino
Appalachians Project, which is now a
[SPEAKER_00]: regionally sponsored project of Origins
Council and serves on the board of
[SPEAKER_00]: directors for the 420 Archive,
which is devoted to collecting,
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving, and sharing the history of
cannabis culture and prohibition in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Janine is also a founding board member for
the Mendocino Cannabis Alliance formed in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2017 to 2020, she served on the board
of directors for the California Growers
[SPEAKER_00]: Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: Omar, if you're able, I'd love for you to
introduce yourself and tell us a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Omar Figueroa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am currently in Sevastopol in Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a lawyer doing cannabis law for
21 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started out, the only type of
cannabis law available was freedom
[SPEAKER_02]: defense, liberating cultivators who had
been charged with felony cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back before 2016, the cultivation of a
single plant for any purpose was deemed a
[SPEAKER_02]: felony and it was a pretty serious
offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: With other lawyers like with Heather,
we did a lot of cannabis defense over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I developed a passion for representing
cannabis growers because they were the
[SPEAKER_02]: nicest of all the defendants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did all their homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did community service.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just the kind of people that I
looked up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my pursuit of the world's finest
cannabis because I had no skills as a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower, I focused on defending growers
because they had certainly the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a saying back in the day,
sell the rest and smoke the best or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, the lawyers would get something
called a headstache, which was the very
[SPEAKER_02]: finest part of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if I were a wine aficionado,
I would have said that I pursued my
[SPEAKER_02]: journey for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was seeking the world's best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I didn't have the skills to produce
it, I focused on representing those who
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the cannabis community myself as
a young person and saw my friends getting
[SPEAKER_03]: arrested and wanted to do something about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to law school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I became a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really lucky that I was good at it and
I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, right out of law school,
I actually went to work for Omar.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was my first mentor out of law school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for him for about two years,
which was awesome because we got to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: really fun, exciting, and all sorts of
crazy emotions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to work primarily for cannabis
farmers and for people who are like my
[SPEAKER_03]: friends and family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intro to the law to practice Omar style
like motion-heavy, really fun,
[SPEAKER_03]: new, novel ideas that we litigated and won
all the time because this cannabis law and
[SPEAKER_03]: where we're at right now, it's a watershed
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these laws were ripe for winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really exciting time as a new
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've been a lawyer 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire time has been supporting
cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say, what kind of lawyer are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, what are cannabis farmers
in need of right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the kind of law I practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times when we see these big
shifts in the law, I'll just get really
[SPEAKER_03]: deep into those areas of law and the
policies and learn that area of law.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that now probably two or three
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited for the Appalachian
program because in my mind, the
[SPEAKER_03]: Appalachian program if we can get it
right, this could be the program that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have been working for for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has the opportunity, the potential
here to really support cannabis farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: and not just any cannabis farmers,
but our legacy heritage producing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers and our legacy producing regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That to me is so exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've shifted my practice towards
Appalachians in a big way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's mostly pro bono work,
policy work, and really just what I like
[SPEAKER_03]: to do on my free time because it's so
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: In any event, I represent cannabis
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been here for five or six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma County, before that, I went to
Humboldt State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in a couple months, my son is going
to college in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be moving back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited to be where I think
we're going to have the greatest
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration of cannabis farmers doing
Appalachian work.
[SPEAKER_03]: To see how that unfolds over the next few
years to me and to be an observer and a
[SPEAKER_03]: supporter in that is the highest honor
that I think that I'll probably ever get
[SPEAKER_03]: in my career.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really grateful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm grateful to work with all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Heather.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Richard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I caught most of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always learned so much when I
listen to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you.
