[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to now drill in and ask a few
deeper questions to our panel members.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the end here, we're going to save a
few minutes for questions from the
[SPEAKER_06]: audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just stated that Measure D was the
worst ordinance written in the history of
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Paul Koretz admitted that he
wrote Measure D.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your relationship like today
because of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Mr. Koretz and I love Mr. Rosenthal
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the only two councilmen that
actually work with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was his fault that it
came out as bad as it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, yeah, it didn't permit us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't protect us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those of us that have limited
immunity, what happens is if the cops,
[SPEAKER_02]: law enforcement, want to come and
challenge us, then we have to prove to
[SPEAKER_02]: them that we have limited immunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, hopefully they'll
leave us alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the worst slum because it didn't give
us anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gave us the right to exist under
limited immunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of the illegal clubs in Los
Angeles exist the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to agree with me that it's
really, really bad and that we have to fix
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ordinance that Glocka wrote goes
in hand with Mercer and all the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that Mercer says so that we qualify and
enable to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is, it was, it is the worst
legislation for a city that I can imagine
[SPEAKER_02]: that could ever exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully things will be much better going
forward with the other cities when they
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now before Measure D passed, you had
gathered signatures through Glocka and put
[SPEAKER_06]: your own measure on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Measure E.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also a Measure F.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you had E, D, and F.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But D, I have to say D passed with 60% of
the voter and the other two, because we
[SPEAKER_02]: backed off of E.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we never advertised it or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the F people I think got like 30% or
40%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that D got 62% of the vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least we knew that the city and the
voters wanted medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we did a poll about six months
ago when we commissioned the new ordinance
[SPEAKER_02]: and it came back at 82%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 82% of LA voters that were polled said
that medical marijuana should exist in the
[SPEAKER_02]: city of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, we have the people on our side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just we need to figure out how to do
it so it's done correctly as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation is concerned.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in hindsight, withdrawing Measure E,
do you believe that that was a good
[SPEAKER_06]: decision at that time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you still do that today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the city was putting up D and we
were told that if we didn't go with the
[SPEAKER_02]: city, we would never win.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was about staying alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went with the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won by 62% of the vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bad, but it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're gonna fix that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna fix that hopefully in March.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one week ago, another organization
called the UCBA Trade Association
[SPEAKER_06]: submitted 100,000 signatures to place an
initiative on the ballot for March of
[SPEAKER_06]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will allow priority licensing to the
135 Prop D dispensaries that have limited
[SPEAKER_06]: immunity from prosecution for being a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk about what you like or
dislike with this measure?
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that 135 dispensaries will be
grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like about that measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've decided, Glocka has decided that in
the interest of the patients and our
[SPEAKER_02]: community in the city of Los Angeles,
that we will work side by side by the
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: UCBA has elected to walk another path and
all power to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The things that are wrong with UCBA
initiative, and we're gonna say one,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that if you abut two residences,
then you'll have to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of dispensaries that are
Prop D, the 135 or however many were left.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said 65, I think 85.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, then those places will have to
close.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't affect me because I don't abut
two residents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a dispensary in Chatsworth,
a Prop D dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't abut two residents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have parking, I have space.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the stuff that's in the initiative
affects me personally or my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is is that anybody that knows
me knows that I'm a Prop D girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the people that stepped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion are the ones that should
be grandfathered in because we fought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Year after year after year to be alive and
to be recognized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I believe that the Prop D
dispensary should be grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one thing that I agree with
in their initiative.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have a new feeling now that you've
already gone the route of the initiative
[SPEAKER_06]: and you've gone the route of compromise.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do you feel the best way to
proceed with implementing full MRSA
[SPEAKER_06]: implementation?
[SPEAKER_02]: The way we've always proceeded,
working with the city, being their friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to educate them, trying to come to
understandings together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to fight with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to talk them into the fact
that we're medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's all about good regulation,
what we can live with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, working with the city,
working side by side with the city is the
[SPEAKER_02]: best path for Glocka to go and that's what
we've decided to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you now view an initiative as a fight?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the initiative was brought on
like last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wrote E to force the city to write
something and put it on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully something better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to choose to go with the city
because that's the way that we had to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to choose to continue to work with
the city side by side and giving them the
[SPEAKER_02]: support and education and all the things
that they need for us so that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: then, you know, craft something that will
be good for our community and the
[SPEAKER_02]: community at large.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Yami.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you so much for everything that
you have done over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've helped so many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all grains of sand in the pail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the pail fills up with lots
of grains of sand so fires can be put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a grain of sand in the pail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just doing what I believe I should
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis gave me back my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm giving back to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's humble as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Yami.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul, in 2003, you were the co-author of
SB 420 which allowed the collective model.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you explain how that idea came to be?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, who decided to put all of these
different entities together to allow what
[SPEAKER_06]: was then commercial licensing essentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wish I could give you a better
explanation, but I won't take credit for
[SPEAKER_01]: much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the late Senator John Vasconcelos
that really did all of the work in the
[SPEAKER_01]: coalition building around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was viewed that 215 was too
vague and we needed to actually provide
[SPEAKER_01]: some direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there were a lot of folks
that were very squeamish about supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wound up being a compromised measure
that was pretty vague.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't my call.
[SPEAKER_01]: My only real involvement was to support it
on the assembly side to be the principal
[SPEAKER_01]: co-author to get it passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll take a little credit for
helping get it passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it probably should have been
written a little more clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I had the same problem and
same opportunity in the city with a
[SPEAKER_01]: council that was completely all over the
map and really there was no consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it ultimately got consensus,
partly Prop D because we could see Bill
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosendahl and he was still alive and still
coming to council meetings because of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana and how much that helped
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it was too personal for
some of the council members to vote
[SPEAKER_01]: against him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it was vague.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't deal with a lot of the issues
that I would have liked to have dealt
[SPEAKER_01]: with, but we were lucky, honestly,
to get it through the council.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a very supportive council and
we had some members that were very
[SPEAKER_01]: strongly opposed, some just on the basis
of being anti-marijuana, but more most
[SPEAKER_01]: being responsive to their constituents who
complained about some of the nuisance
[SPEAKER_01]: factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot of that has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a few years, we've had more than the
majority of council change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the folks that were really
anti-marijuana mostly are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the council members have not had
to deal with the issue at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we actually have a more open
council now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, our council president, Herb Wesson,
I think has helped sort of take control of
[SPEAKER_01]: the issue and he's trying to come up with
something reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and I and another council member,
Nuri Martinez, led the effort to put
[SPEAKER_01]: together a working group to try and come
up with answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, we wound up not going with the
results of that working group,
[SPEAKER_01]: but deciding to have the rules committee,
which council president Wesson chairs,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually make more of the decision on
where this goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna have three major public
hearings try to get input that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think since the working group,
we've gotten a lot of input from folks in
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the city that don't have a lot of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of input from folks that
we want more women-owned dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want more minority-owned dispensaries,
and hopefully more dispensaries in general
[SPEAKER_01]: than the either 85 or 135.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure which direction this is
going to go in, but I'm hopeful at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, we address all the intuitive things
that we should address, like cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: like transportation, like delivery,
like having access throughout the city and
[SPEAKER_01]: not just where people perceive the most
money to be made or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an overabundance in my
district, and there's some areas that have
[SPEAKER_01]: virtually none.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll try to correct all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do with the initiative,
I'm not entirely sure, because we may just
[SPEAKER_01]: have an ordinance to deal with this,
or we may put an initiative on the ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: to try and pass our vision rather than the
vision of a group that happened to put it
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we may pass an ordinance before and
then ask LA voters to turn down what's on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ballot, because we've already dealt
with this appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all very much up in the air,
but hopefully at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll do the right thing and put the
vagueness of this issue to bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's basically many directions that
this could go in.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fixing Measure D, you have an
initiative that could be on the ballot in
[SPEAKER_06]: March in a special election.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may issue your own to compete with
that, or you may just try to come together
[SPEAKER_06]: and create your own ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in theory, I think we can also adopt
what's been proposed so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to put it in the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can just agree with it and implement
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also technically a possibility,
but I think there's some issues that that
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative doesn't deal with, and I think
we'll want to try and resolve everything
[SPEAKER_01]: all in one shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What advice could you give to our audience
members that are currently trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: advocate their local elected officials in
order to persuade them to regulate instead
[SPEAKER_06]: of banning this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure whether I had great results
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of the worst things that were
proposed didn't happen only because we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: legal threats in every wrong direction
that we looked, as well as some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: right ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think certainly in terms of medical
marijuana, to the extent that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: personalize it, and there are people that
are still alive or being well treated
[SPEAKER_01]: because of medical marijuana, people that
are dealing better with cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are dealing better with HIV
and AIDS, and the host of medical issues
[SPEAKER_01]: that could be helped, I think that's the
most compelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything against Proposition
64, but I think the fact that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually helped and stay alive,
I think is the most compelling argument in
[SPEAKER_01]: its favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are some areas that are very
depressed economically, and the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: there may be more jobs and more economic
activity may work in some areas that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not used to thinking about, but I don't
think that's the answer, certainly in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greater LA area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the strongest argument is that it
can help your constituents stay alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: stay healthier, and that's certainly the
argument that I use because that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: care about myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Paul.
[SPEAKER_06]: Janine, Long Beach has a very convoluted
history with regulating marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk a little bit about the
history of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much of this, I was kind of on the
sidelines watching, and like many in Long
[SPEAKER_04]: Beach, assuming that because we are a
quote unquote progressive city,
[SPEAKER_04]: that we would more easily be able to
regulate medicinal marijuana than other
[SPEAKER_04]: cities, but what we found is in 2010,
we had my predecessor, Sujal Lowenthal,
[SPEAKER_04]: along with other council members decided
that they wanted to move forward with
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation, and in 2010, they went forward
with a application process, and I have
[SPEAKER_04]: dates down just because I don't,
like the pros are in the room,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I don't want to mess this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are like the guys that have been
doing this work, so you guys can correct
[SPEAKER_04]: me, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2012, they actually, we banned
medicinal marijuana because the city was
[SPEAKER_04]: sued, and at that time, that lawsuit went
up to the California Supreme Court,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was kicked down, denied,
and so in 2012, what they did,
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry guys, they went out and tried
to put a ballot measure together to adjust
[SPEAKER_04]: this ban, and they were shy 18 signatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: 18 signatures, and so the city council
said, obviously, we are in a city that
[SPEAKER_04]: supports regulation, and so they gave it
to the planning commission, it went
[SPEAKER_04]: through a process, we put together a task
force, and in that time, we had elections,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so we had a turnover with some council
members, and I believe, and this was not
[SPEAKER_04]: what my industry guys wanted me to say,
but that's too bad, I believe what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened was that we had a shift in
culture from a city that was saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, we want to do the right thing,
and trying to figure out the details,
[SPEAKER_04]: and trying to work with organized
industry, trying to work with small
[SPEAKER_04]: business owners to find out what was the
best model, and I think this goes to what
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Member Koretz is saying,
is that you have intention to do good,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you don't know what the outcome is
going to be, and in addition to what the
[SPEAKER_04]: outcome is going to be, you have to talk
about messaging and how we frame it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so during that time of trying to come
back and say, okay, we want to go ahead as
[SPEAKER_04]: a council and put together an ordinance
that wouldn't go on the ballot,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that the council would have the
ability to vote on, the good thing about
[SPEAKER_04]: doing that is that the council can then
make adjustments, should there be a
[SPEAKER_04]: negative impact that you hadn't planned
on, the council can then take another
[SPEAKER_04]: vote, adjust the ordinance, and so that is
the good thing about doing it with the
[SPEAKER_04]: council.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a new council member and a lot of
frame around public safety, and that frame
[SPEAKER_04]: has kind of gotten a wedge within our city
council where we felt like we were on the
[SPEAKER_04]: right path, we then have this conversation
about public safety that that has to be
[SPEAKER_04]: number one, it's no longer the
conversation change from being about
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal purposes, it changed from the
stories of Joey or Martha or other people
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be impacted and it changed to
just about public safety, and this is why
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys in the industry are so important
to be able to come back and give us facts
[SPEAKER_04]: like the fact that the UCLA Center did a
study, a five year study, where they went
[SPEAKER_04]: outside of dispensaries and said,
okay, what's crime happening and what are
[SPEAKER_04]: the impacts of having dispensaries in our
neighborhood and came back with no
[SPEAKER_04]: significant correlation in crime
increasing, and so we know whenever we
[SPEAKER_04]: regulate from talking to you guys,
from making sure we're working with
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, education centers, that when we
do that together, we can have the facts,
[SPEAKER_04]: that it has to be about medicine and it
has to be about what's really happening on
[SPEAKER_04]: the ground and taking away the fear,
taking away the fear of what an impact
[SPEAKER_04]: might be to have these shops in our
neighborhoods, and so we tried to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through that process, I remember that
night very clearly, we're at council,
[SPEAKER_04]: we thought we had a vote on an ordinance
that had been worked on since 2010,
[SPEAKER_04]: going back and forth with the city
attorney, with council, with mayors,
[SPEAKER_04]: we thought we were gonna have a vote,
and unfortunately, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to try to, as we talk about,
find that middle ground, and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: find a middle ground on something like
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to find a middle ground on
something like medicine that it's really,
[SPEAKER_04]: the outcome has to be the best interest of
the patients and the best interest of
[SPEAKER_04]: residents, and not pandering to one type
of specimen or special interest or
[SPEAKER_04]: another, but it has to be on that basis,
and so we came down to trying to get to
[SPEAKER_04]: that middle of the road, and I'm really
proud of some of my colleagues,
[SPEAKER_04]: who are now my colleagues, that said,
you know what, we're not going to go down
[SPEAKER_04]: the middle path, we're not gonna say only
delivery and no shops, we're not gonna say
[SPEAKER_04]: only four delivery services or only four
shops, and we're not gonna do that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I know that that was a hard night,
but essentially, they threw their hands up
[SPEAKER_04]: and said, we can't come to consensus on
what a good policy would be for our city,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so folks got together, they collected
thousands of signatures, and now we have
[SPEAKER_04]: on the ballot in November, Measure MM,
which is regulating medicinal marijuana,
[SPEAKER_04]: allowing for shops to be city-wide,
also regulating grow and dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_04]: retail, and we're looking at somewhere
between 800 and 1,000 jobs, and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at making sure that residents can
have access to their medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they even, it repeals the old ban,
it repeals the old taxes, and it puts in
[SPEAKER_04]: place a new tax, and for retail,
it's between six and eight percent,
[SPEAKER_04]: which personally, we know that taxing
medicine is a little, it's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legally, there's some questions there,
but also just in your gut, should we be
[SPEAKER_04]: taxing medicine whenever it's about making
sure people have access to that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so I think the industry did a great
job about making this policy very,
[SPEAKER_04]: that it has a longer distance from
schools, making sure that it's very highly
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated for an industry to put this on,
and so we have Measure MM on the ballot
[SPEAKER_04]: now that we know is gonna pass,
we need to make sure we do all the work,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm committed to doing the work with those
guys, making sure that that passes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and what's been fascinating is that the
district that has fought the hardest
[SPEAKER_04]: against any kind of conversation around
marijuana is the district that has the
[SPEAKER_04]: highest percent of support, and it's
amazing what polls can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing what polls can do,
and so I think part of it is also sharing
[SPEAKER_04]: that information and making sure that
elected leaders know that their
[SPEAKER_04]: constituents support things like this
instead of living in a bubble of fear
[SPEAKER_04]: about what might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to Measure MM, the mayor and
the city council put on another initiative
[SPEAKER_04]: to tax medical and recreational at a
higher level should 64 and MM pass,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that happened really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came to the floor really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, any time there's marijuana on
the agenda in Long Beach, it's kinda
[SPEAKER_04]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long night, there's a ton of
people, so I get, just to give you a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of information, I get sworn in,
and my first three council meetings all
[SPEAKER_04]: had marijuana on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single one of them, and it was,
I'm all about jumping in feet first,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so one of them was the tax initiative
that we put on the ballot, Measure MA,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it is tough because I wanna make sure
that our city has the resources that we
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we have a new industry coming in,
there's an opportunity for new revenue,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this initiative now says that the city
can tax at a higher rate, so it can go
[SPEAKER_04]: eight to 10 for medical or 10 to 12 for
recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or adult use, and so we get to come back
and have that debate again, but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: the challenge is how we have that debate
and making sure it's rooted in facts and
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers and what the real need is in our
city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the need more police officers?
[SPEAKER_04]: If crime is going down whenever we
regulate, is the need really more police
[SPEAKER_04]: officers, or is the need to spend those
dollars in some reentry support for people
[SPEAKER_04]: that will be coming out of jail or no
longer having a probation hit or something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's have a fruitful conversation
about what that looks like, where the real
[SPEAKER_04]: needs are, and this is again for industry
to step up and talk with us about what
[SPEAKER_04]: those opportunities are, but also reaching
out to unlikely allies to say,
[SPEAKER_04]: what is your experience with people coming
out of the criminal justice system,
[SPEAKER_04]: and where are the most need?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we know the cities right now are
struggling with that, and so we wanna
[SPEAKER_04]: support our residents, we wanna make sure
things are safe, and I think regulating is
[SPEAKER_04]: the best way to do that, as long as we're
doing smart regulation and we're doing it
[SPEAKER_04]: for the right reasons, and so yeah,
we have a little bit of a difficult
[SPEAKER_04]: background, but I think looking at what
all the cities have done, we've had an
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to learn from that and
hopefully move forward in the right
[SPEAKER_04]: direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does sound like you're moving
forward, so thank you so much for your
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the midst of what some of us in the
industry dubbed Banna Palooza in January,
[SPEAKER_06]: voted 5-0 to regulate the cannabis
industry, and shortly after that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you began talking about selling your
abandoned prison to a marijuana extract
[SPEAKER_06]: company.
[SPEAKER_06]: How did that conversation begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I actually went through minutes
trying to figure this all out,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's been seven months or eight
months of this, and it's got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: convoluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our first meeting in January,
we were brought with the decision to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate our ban across the board,
all the different things, dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, personal cultivation,
delivery systems, that type of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we voted 5-0 to go forward with it,
because we had a crowd of people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: there that were in support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the very next meeting in, I believe it
was in February, we had the darn near the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word had gotten out that we had voted
to do this, and a crowd of the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite came, and they held our feet to
the fire, which I commend them for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: so, because it helped us in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not argue with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We listened to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anyone looking how to succeed in a
city, turning on your listening ears and
[SPEAKER_00]: listening and writing down what the fears
are of the people will help you gain some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of idea of what you can do to
compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And life as a councilman and government
and local government is all about
[SPEAKER_00]: compromise, regardless of whether we like
that or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so moving forward, our people told us
all the issues that they had with the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, because that's what we were
set to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what our 5-0 vote was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to allow a dispensary in the
city of Kalinga that has about 15,000
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we listened to the medical needs,
the compassion, and then at the second
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting we listened to the people that
said about their concerns with crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three different agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the college, the school,
and the parks and rec all wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: resolutions against what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy said that we were prostituting out
our town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazingly enough, that was a hard one to
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had businesses come in and said that
they thought that this would bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong element of people to our town.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went forward knowing this information
and we held workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We held like two workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first workshop was kind of a back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought in Mr. Michael Green from the
Fresno Cannabis Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went to town on MRSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like our fixation on the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amazingly enough, a lot of our
residents that were against this after
[SPEAKER_00]: they realized that the law was in support
of these angles, their minds started to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hey, hmm, it's not just a deal where
the federal government is against it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are going to try and operate
outside of federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once he explained MRSA, things started to
change in people's minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't like a night and day thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like we're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're understanding and we're hearing and
we know that there's people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're understanding that there's a medical
need, but we still have security concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our, I think it's our March 30th
meeting, we had a company called Ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put an offer in on the prison,
right then and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they sent it in and it was on our
closed session agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we went from having one or two
people at council meetings to having it
[SPEAKER_00]: full.
[SPEAKER_00]: People said that they couldn't trust us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming to council.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is how we get people to
show up for the local government.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of amazed at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe we're doing something right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we want people to be involved
locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had that closed session agenda item
and it was to sell the prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have discussion at the same time
about the marijuana thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to reframe the idea into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed lead and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Council members started doing some
research on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, I started looking at, you know,
listening to the public actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, the public kept
using the word marijuana and they kept
[SPEAKER_00]: tying all the bad things to what this word
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started watching and attending
meetings for other councils and other
[SPEAKER_00]: board of supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was listening to the crowd and the
people and they were using the word
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like when they used to call
them drug stores and now they call them
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a nice little change right there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to change that narrative and
change the narrative into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time that the city of Kalinga,
which I'll tell you, our city was
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily into the oil industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalinga had a nice oil boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had a very nice prison
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say nice because it provided people
with a lot of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of people like me that
were against the prisons when they came
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saying, hey, you want to talk about
bringing the wrong kind of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to bring the wrong kind of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when AB 109 passed and one of the
other propositions, and it basically said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, you've got to dump these prisons,
a lot of them, because we're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: people and not put them into prisons for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote his
thing and basically decriminalized a major
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of marijuana, what happened was is
the states weren't willing to renew
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts with a lot of the prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Kalinga had a private prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Claremont Custody Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we staffed the prison and we charged
for bed space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the prison went down and we could
no longer do that, that prison was
[SPEAKER_00]: providing about a million dollars of
revenue into our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know that medical patients and
medical people don't want to hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: the revenues portion of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me explain why this is important
for Kalinga.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had a five-year period where we
were losing a million dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had citizens that had moved there
that learned to like police and fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, we need these services.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's police officers there when we need
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And firemen and ambulances take us to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're in a huge problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% of most general funds in small
communities go to police and fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you lose a million dollars,
you have two choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either cut or you can create
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, me being in business myself,
I understand population is a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population in location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your two things when you look at
factors of creating a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Kalinga is not in a very good
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably 12 miles from the I-5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are centrally located, but we're kind
of like in this desert oil kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, if without a good
population doesn't make a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to come there, when they can go to
places like Hanford and Fresno that are
[SPEAKER_00]: larger populations and sit closer to the
I-5, the corridors and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had these two industries,
the oil industry and the prison industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prison industry got taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drought came across and hit us really,
really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our farming community,
we lost that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the oil companies start to pull
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so council is giving this opportunity
and saying, hey, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're moving from the January
1st, we're going to February, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the narrative had to change at some
point in time because we weren't going
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere with the battle back and forth
with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have gained a couple percentage of
people who said, yes, this is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't think so beforehand because
they watched the videos of the kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: seizing and having a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: They watched the videos of PBS putting on
saying that cancer cells can be killed
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we put the Placer County video
out there to help, you know, get some
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't the game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The game changer was when you tell people
we can provide opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opportunity in growth in the economy to
fill a void that was left behind by other
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when, I'm not kidding, I seen the
look on the people's faces and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, we need jobs and so you
hold on, you're not talking about bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: a dispensary to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we stopped talking about bringing a
dispensary and Ocean Grown started talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about purchasing our prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that a lot of people may not
agree with that tactic and think to
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, well, that doesn't provide the
need for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were trying to look at an overall
and if we can get a company to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to make medicine,
that's a step in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a foot in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, so that's where we
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold the prison, $4.1 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should take care of our initial in
debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the city of Kalinga will be out of
debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after, well, in doing that
process, we had to create an ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the way that we wanted to create the
ordinance, we had a lot of back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we wanted to do is we wanted
to get them in business in a quick amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of time because of our financial needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had suggested going to CAL FIRE to
get rid of our fire department,
[SPEAKER_00]: not because we wanted to, but because we
couldn't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out it was going to be more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we really have a big
financial draw of negative $800,000 a year
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are negative in the whole that led
up to that $3.6 million deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the financial goal was first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry to say that to everybody,
but that was the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, financial goal was first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't stop the rest of the
agenda, which is getting the people the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and changing the outcome of how
cannabis affects everybody in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone that could be having the
cannabis to be used as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we created our ordinance,
we did an interim or an urgency ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That urgency ordinance allowed for
everyone that was in that zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think it was light manufacturing
industrial, to be able to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple different places that were
close to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put in the ordinance that had to be
1,800 feet away from a school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our ordinance is a little bit more
stringent than MRSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason was because our citizens
required that in order to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought that that would be prudent
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we're talking to the
industry folks, they wanted protection
[SPEAKER_00]: from law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our city seemed to be a very unique
opportunity where you still hear of
[SPEAKER_00]: counties getting raided today because you
have multiple sheriff agencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have multiple federal agencies teaming
up with sheriff agencies that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're picking off the people in the
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a big county and has
multiple sheriff operations, one might not
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go and they hit that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kalinga, we're trying to create a safe
place with regulation and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's going to be a lot
of opportunity in the Central Valley for
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we opened up this new area that I
think we're going to probably have five or
[SPEAKER_00]: ten companies come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still opportunity for anyone
that's in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Central Valley would be a
great place for you guys to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank everyone here for
giving us your ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don, you currently have an interim
ordinance in place allowing one acre of
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some of the pitfalls you are
facing as a regulator in implementing this
[SPEAKER_06]: ordinance?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to talk about some of the
challenges that we're grappling with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first I just want to congratulate
Nathan.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they've done is they've taken a
prison that used to house pot offenders
[SPEAKER_03]: and people who were Brown and Brock people
who were captured as a part of this
[SPEAKER_03]: criminal mentality that prohibition has
created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've sold it to help their city and
to produce medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the delights of attending a
conference like this is to learn from each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our ordinance is we wanted to,
we're seeing this through largely the lens
[SPEAKER_03]: of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's other lenses that you can look
at, the current state of cannabis through
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal, what's happening for patients,
how do we get the best efficacy for the
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we can look at it as revenue or we can
look at it as public safety and social
[SPEAKER_03]: justice, all these issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're an agricultural county and
what our county government deals with is
[SPEAKER_03]: unincorporated areas outside the cities,
outside the built areas, the industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: areas and commercial spaces are all in the
incorporated cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're dealing with outdoor,
I heard the phrase the other day,
[SPEAKER_03]: sun grown or outdoor grow areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're dealing with agricultural
settings and we're dealing with a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: lack of information, misunderstanding,
among ourselves and certainly among the
[SPEAKER_03]: communities that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also dealing with people who in many
cases have been growing in the fields and
[SPEAKER_03]: hills and forests for some time and are
interacting with their neighbors on a
[SPEAKER_03]: regular basis and have found already some
peace and ways of dealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the ordinance has 1,000 feet away from
any school or sensitive such kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: sensitive area where children are likely
to congregate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 1,000 feet away and then we have,
in order to address the most common
[SPEAKER_03]: concerns that we knew about of odor and
noise and light, we have a 75 feet from
[SPEAKER_03]: any grow site to any structure that's
occupied on a neighboring property.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very simple kinds of conditions
that go into effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now since it's an interim ordinance,
we're taking the time now to go and talk
[SPEAKER_03]: with each of the communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had town hall meetings in several
places and it's very interesting because
[SPEAKER_03]: the fears as Nathan mentioned,
you hear the fears from people but
[SPEAKER_03]: oftentimes in the same comment before they
even take a breath to change to another
[SPEAKER_03]: sentence, someone will say I'm against
this, I don't like this at all and how do
[SPEAKER_03]: I get into the business?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hearing that kind of mindset
changing even while we're talking to
[SPEAKER_03]: folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the challenges that we've got
in agriculture, we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're dealing with water quality issues,
that we're providing the best advice and
[SPEAKER_03]: the safest regulations framework for
pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are two very important,
that's an agricultural commodity and our
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural commissioner is very involved
in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's our thought leader in our county
government and he's also the glue,
[SPEAKER_03]: the connector between our county
regulatory apparatus, the board of
[SPEAKER_03]: supervisors, the planning people,
environmental health people and the grower
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so John Young is the gentleman's name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been out listening to everybody and
then he takes their views and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to, he's doing something you
don't see in government hardly ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's sharing interim drafts or draft
ordinance language.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says okay, you're concerned about
residency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what it would look like if we
put residency language in the permanent
[SPEAKER_03]: ordinance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now residency is a very weird and
interesting thing that where some people
[SPEAKER_03]: would say well we don't want outsiders to
come into our little county and buy up all
[SPEAKER_03]: the property because they're going to put
these massive speculative pressures on the
[SPEAKER_03]: property prices and that's going to price
out the organic farmers who are raising
[SPEAKER_03]: foods for our community supported
agriculture and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got, that's a real issue for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are talking about ways of
addressing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Residency comes up as one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another is that in order to achieve these,
the buffers that we're talking about in
[SPEAKER_03]: some cases you have to have a certain,
creates a de facto minimum size for a
[SPEAKER_03]: property parcel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's an effect on some folks who
have smaller properties and would like to
[SPEAKER_03]: be involved in legal cultivation and
getting a permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are dynamics that go that way as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're asking, we ask people questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is an acre too large?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it too small?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just right for a commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answers that are coming back are,
it's not consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like well 30% think it's too large,
30% think it's too small and 30% think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are threading the needle and we will
be threading that needle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, so those are some of the
implementation issues that we'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh and there's another, there's one last
one that I want to raise on this topic and
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, that we have different sort of
areas or sub-regions within the county and
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody always feels like well my
neighborhood's getting targeted for X or
[SPEAKER_03]: Y, whatever the thing is going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have, in Yolo County our
agricultural economy is very diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have large scale production agriculture
with tens of thousands of acres under
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation and very few people working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have very small farms, 20,
100, 100 acres where they're very labor
[SPEAKER_03]: intensive in producing organic crops for
farmers markets and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to think that cannabis
can't exist with that same sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: analogous situation where you have small
growers, larger growers, some are growing
[SPEAKER_03]: for different kinds of markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's actually kind of exciting
to me to think how that might all work
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we think about it and we think
about how that lands in the individual
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhoods some of the folks are
interested in making sure that the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators are dispersed throughout the
county, that it's not all in one location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others are talking about well maybe if it
was, if we had more cultivators in a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain location, a certain area,
then we could provide for greater safety
[SPEAKER_03]: and security for all concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, and I said that as the last one,
but there is one more and that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: vagueness of the interaction among the
various legal frameworks that we're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You all know that more, a lot better than
I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we, for the first time with the MRSA,
the state has given us a framework that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were as lost, local government was as
lost and stalemated as the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't figure out what to do if
anything and so we basically all stayed
[SPEAKER_03]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of us did.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us did anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we've got a framework that we can
make some sense of, but there's still so
[SPEAKER_03]: much vagueness between what's at the
federal level, what's used to be the state
[SPEAKER_03]: law, what will be the state framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just trying to navigate to thread
a needle on all this and make some sense
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are trying to make sense of it and you
know the title of this panel is called
[SPEAKER_06]: Cities, Counties, and Bans Oh My.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about to get to the Oh My part right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just 12 days ago on September 14th at 7 a
.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: in the morning, a simultaneous raid
occurred in Yolo County as well as three
[SPEAKER_06]: of the homes of the farmers on one of
these licensed facilities by an
[SPEAKER_06]: out-of-county task force called Tri-County
Drug Enforcement Team or Trident,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is an initiative of the Central
Valley High Intensity Drug Trafficking
[SPEAKER_06]: Area or HITA.
[SPEAKER_06]: They came into Yolo County with a Placer
County warrant and kicked doors in and
[SPEAKER_06]: took down a half acre of a legally
licensed farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Don, can you tell us how you feel about
an outer jurisdiction law enforcement
[SPEAKER_06]: agency coming in and taking down something
that you permitted and gave your blessing
[SPEAKER_06]: for?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said that there were about 53 growers
that are going through the permitting
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: About half of them are in place and one in
particular, a couple of them, have been
[SPEAKER_03]: really shining stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at us and they look for
guidance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever we tell them, this is how things
will work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They immediately comply.
[SPEAKER_03]: They set up the irrigation system,
set up the drainage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make sure that they're doing all the
right things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They apply for the state, for the regional
water quality control board permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get all of it in place and then
something like this happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that many of you here in this room
have heard this story or even had it
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to yourself or to somebody you
know, but it's pretty darn scary when you
[SPEAKER_03]: think of seven in the morning,
the front door is broken in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody says, I'm a law enforcement
official, open your door please.
[SPEAKER_03]: They break the door in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They show up in unmarked vehicles in four
different locations in three different
[SPEAKER_03]: counties with guns drawn where there are
little kids involved and they handcuff
[SPEAKER_03]: people and put zip ties on them and
they're throwing people against walls and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're making them kneel on the ground
and they're interrogating them without
[SPEAKER_03]: giving them Miranda rights for hours after
a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a terrorist activity if you think
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just think about what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the meaning of terrorism,
what this means is they're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: instill fear.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tactics deliberately instill fear and
it comes at a time for us when we're
[SPEAKER_03]: walking to monitor our ordinance and we're
working to develop tweaks, things that we
[SPEAKER_03]: might want to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now have this added dimension of
well, what was the offense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there something that's being alleged
that is illegal that we didn't know about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not hearing any specific charges
even.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, none of the people involved in
this incident have been charged with
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet 1,800 plants that are designed and
connected to a collective for medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose have been destroyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people involved are very shaken.
[SPEAKER_03]: So psychologically shaken.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought they were doing all the right
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're deliberately working hard to make
sure they do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still sorting this out and to
have this be done, from this shadowy group
[SPEAKER_03]: that comes in unmarked cars with no
license plate indication and from another
[SPEAKER_03]: county.
[SPEAKER_03]: From another county.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not part of this three county.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's El Dorado, Placer, and Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, led by Placer County, a district
attorney in his strike force.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are still struggling to figure out
exactly what this was about and how it
[SPEAKER_03]: affects the people involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that the people involved are
very stunned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think of it as an act of terrorism.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Don, you just called this an act of
terrorism by Trident.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm wondering, do you believe that
this will hinder your progress as your
[SPEAKER_06]: county is making very big strides in
crafting sensible regulations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that it sets up a whole
series of questions that we have been
[SPEAKER_03]: working to look at the whole cannabis war
world through the eyes of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does this commodity work?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we support it in the same ways that
we've supported other agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: commodities?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we regulate it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, we have not talked about
revenues.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't looked at this from a taxation
purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're charging fees that we think will
absorb the cost and allow us to do some
[SPEAKER_03]: code enforcement for the shadowy
operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we're going to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've also been looking at more and
more the medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited because I want to see us
all look into the greater research
[SPEAKER_03]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want Yolo County to be a place where
that's a center of that kind of activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we have a whole other series of
questions that we know will be asked by
[SPEAKER_03]: members of the board of supervisors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, really, was there something going on
here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something in the shadows that we
need to shy away from?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that to the degree that we
allow that fear to come from our community
[SPEAKER_03]: members or from the decision makers,
to the degree that we allow that to change
[SPEAKER_03]: our course, then the terror has succeeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there is going to be some
discussion about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I need to say,
this is how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we're assured that this is an
interesting comment here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're assured that the
investigation is still underway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that means it's not over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's something yet to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this great specter of maybe
there's some illegal act that we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know about yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I probably shouldn't even talk about
it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the affidavit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look like it's criminal what
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we have this specter that's
certainly going to change the conversation
[SPEAKER_03]: to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how or when.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the call about this raid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a farm that I had helped consult
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really have to say, Yolo County
regulators rose to the occasion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they got on the phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Ag Department got a hold of this
lead detective from this outside county
[SPEAKER_06]: task force.
[SPEAKER_06]: And said, please stop chopping down these
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a licensed farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that lead detective said, whatever,
ag guy, and hung up the phone on him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these people really did rise up to try
to protect that farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just so proud of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please give it up for Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
