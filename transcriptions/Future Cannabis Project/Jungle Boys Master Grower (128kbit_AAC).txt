[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Martinez, who was the head girl for
Jungle Boys, he was my best friend since
[SPEAKER_00]: 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd laugh because I hadn't this particular
gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny, just the way the world
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I are up at a show in Northern
California at the High Times event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit up the Jungle Boys tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give out A's very often when we're
judging weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we walk in and I'm standing there at
the counter and I'm like, honey,
[SPEAKER_00]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an A plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that, and so is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looks at me in shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the hype, babe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three right there are A pluses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff over there is kind of a B.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these three right here, those are A
pluses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are solid, solid genetics right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four months later, I'm in another
conversation with a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh yeah, do you know who
the head grower for Jungle Boys is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, it's Ryan Martinez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, had to be one of five people I
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to be, but I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a big grower right here in Malibu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he helped me develop my program back
when we were 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked together, you know, like,
you know, screwing up plants, feeding them
[SPEAKER_00]: to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live and learn, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This iteration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was so funny when I just died of
tears when it just was like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: what a small world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Adam, what are you doing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had lost touch with him?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just, yeah, I had been in Montana
growing for seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he came up actually when I
set up my program in Montana, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he was my best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just had gone our ways and doing
our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he got married and had a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was down here busy as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was up there just busy as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just living your life, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just, you know, a few highs,
but not any real communication,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just died of tears when I'm like,
had to be one of five people that was
[SPEAKER_00]: either Ryan Martinez, Marshall Davis,
Kelly Bellisimo, you know, who grew that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're huge at LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've wanted me to come on board with
them, but their culture isn't exactly my
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a certain swagger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where I'm more of a low-key,
quiet farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't play with anything white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's...
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never did.
