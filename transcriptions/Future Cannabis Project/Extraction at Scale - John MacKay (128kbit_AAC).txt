[SPEAKER_01]: So John McKay you gave a presentation on
extraction yesterday at the conference and
[SPEAKER_01]: You started by asking everybody how many
of you do extraction and like three people
[SPEAKER_01]: raised their hands And then what was the
next comment you made?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment I was making was more of
of saying why would you possibly want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that this the presentation was about
whether you build up your own extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: company or whether you Do in-house so but
wait both those are those is that
[SPEAKER_01]: redundant or have you outsourced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd have to do the indoors So the
seminar was about whether you do in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction or whether you outsource So
that would be two different choices that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't the same correct And so if I went
back through as easily as informative and
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing as that statement but the part
that's important is is with a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are now into the industry and
The number of people that are that are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to be totally vertical is very
different from 2017 or 2016 for sure Back
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2013 and before that there were
probably just three or four vendors There
[SPEAKER_00]: were four or five different ways to do
extraction most of them came from what all
[SPEAKER_00]: we call the cottage industry and it was a
very very different world and Now as you
[SPEAKER_00]: move towards the hemp world, which is
significantly different enormous numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: of scale on the scope scale in the scope
nobody 300 acre hemp farm extraction.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh 300 is is a small one So some of the
people that I'm working with now are
[SPEAKER_00]: moving to 7,000 even here in the United
States And so there was no one doing 7,000
[SPEAKER_00]: a book of Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about give me like a Per thousand
acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what's the volume of biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh or per acre Yeah, so if I was
to go back through it, I'll backtrack
[SPEAKER_00]: another way and that is the entire flow no
matter what the the yield would be from an
[SPEAKER_00]: it from an acre is and the reason I
wouldn't give that answer is because
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of different percentages
up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very low percentage in Europe It's
a lower percentage here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States People are have got varieties that
are 20% CBD for example Call it CBD a cuz
[SPEAKER_00]: not CBD and then but but they're also
doing some one-to-one CBD to CBC and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in one-to-one of CBD to THCV and
at the same time they've Been able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: out the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have no THC or very little THC
just quickly when you mentioned Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: versus Let's say in California when you
said Canada is low low yielding or low
[SPEAKER_00]: what so they within their laws and stuff
They're they're less than the 2% many
[SPEAKER_00]: times of the hemp that they're making so
they have to be able to extract You know
[SPEAKER_00]: real hemp that's you know low low
percentage THC CBD a You mean they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: cap on the amount of CBD that they can My
understanding so I don't want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation, but at the same time many
when I've talked to up there It's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: low amount of CBD a that they're trying to
get out of the of the plants that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that they're Regulatory allowed to
do yeah, I would I would fact-check that
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will definitely fact-check it,
but I find that interesting so in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: They're breeding genetics that basically
have a low yield of anything kind of yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I Mean definitely low THC because that's a
requirement and low CBD which for I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much everybody who's growing hemp
in North America right now is for Isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: and extraction is that kind of that is
true like nobody's making it for clothing
[SPEAKER_00]: or Paper, but there are a lot of people
that are doing it so you'll find people
[SPEAKER_00]: that Are growing some of the agricultural
ones with the long stocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: but but because When people have to make
that decisions on how they're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: their land currently with the CBD being at
such a high You know price then they
[SPEAKER_00]: they're making the choice between should I
make a thousand dollars an acre sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: make a hundred thousand dollars an acre
the the numbers are pretty You know drives
[SPEAKER_01]: you towards the CBD right so You're the
guy who comes in at the tail end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole process Which is the extraction,
but it seems like you would have a say in
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation around what?
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals or cultivars What hemp cultivars
cultivators are cultivating so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about kind of what you're
seeing out there because I feel like hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars are so new in North America That
nobody has like a 10-year track record
[SPEAKER_01]: with I've been growing this type And it's
a high yielding this that or the other so
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on from a you know planting
different cultivars and seeing what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: most prolific in terms of extraction or
other and Purposes so it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting on some of the things that
I've learned to the industry especially
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last three years with the hemp
Because before that you know I didn't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: much attention probably most people didn't
but when you're looking at it now The it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's growing a cultivar that is regionally
specific and growing a cultivar That
[SPEAKER_00]: people understand how to transport the
plants to wherever they're going to The
[SPEAKER_00]: education from propagation from
propagation to the field and then also the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of people that are experts at being
able to know How you plant it and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also see the farming equipment coming in
on so that they're planting those the
[SPEAKER_00]: other part is When I go to the first crop
so there's people I know that are wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow 7,000 acres, and I'm always
telling them and where that Are they
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that they're growing it California
in New Mexico Colorado and you go back
[SPEAKER_00]: through and you at Kentucky and you go
back through and you and you and you Bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them back to 25 or 300 acres And you will
see the difference as it as it moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: their first crop of things that are small
things that are big You know the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are high the plants that just die and
so the first year is to figure out Oh my
[SPEAKER_00]: gosh hemp is very sensitive to where it's
growing you can have one that's three feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall and one that's 12 feet tall because
That's where you figure out you know where
[SPEAKER_00]: the best soil is or whatever happened or
something gets flooded out or something
[SPEAKER_00]: gets dried out so in Kentucky for example
the the filtration the way their land is
[SPEAKER_00]: it filters very very clean water,
but it filters very quickly through that
[SPEAKER_00]: and In Oregon I've seen stuff that's clay
I could practically make pottery out of
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're growing it in and then so
each one is so widely different and each
[SPEAKER_00]: one has to be Variety different so you
can't just buy seeds online Like I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: grab big boy tomatoes versus the small
ones so in can you give some examples of
[SPEAKER_01]: some Are we calling them varietals or
cultivars cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so can you give some examples of
some cultivars that you're seeing that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are are Start that that are
starting to dominate the market in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: markets to take to sort of Be consistent
with the fact that the different micro
[SPEAKER_01]: climates are conducive To different
cultivars, so I'll start with a quick one
[SPEAKER_00]: the quick answer is no I can't okay the
second answer is I could kill a plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: plant So I've been staying in my lane as
far as the swim lane whatever they have
[SPEAKER_00]: for a cultivar that's out there Then my
extraction will will be towards what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to get out of that But it's
but I've really stayed out of that side so
[SPEAKER_01]: now let's move on to the extraction side
And I'm sticking with hemp because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's something new and different and
interesting it is in the market So talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: me about like you have a facility in
Oakland that for cannabis You have all
[SPEAKER_01]: these different extraction All this
different extraction equipment for
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what ethanol co2 you're not doing
butane We can talk about that later,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for hemp is there Are you in that
game?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in that game out of that same Oakland
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you can bring in both cannabis
And and hemp yes into the same facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so What's going on in the hemp
world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you starting?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your first year in operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's fast forward to the end of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay went when Harvest season is upon us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get like this much cannabis
and This much hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and so are you ready for massive
quantities of hemp and and what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: what are the conversations you're having?
[SPEAKER_00]: With hemp cultivators, it's a great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are these are the situations I
have currently so I have a facility that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would call the I Won't call this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strip mall Sears and Roebuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strip mall store and in that I'm
able to show the smaller Components of how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do each type of extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ethanol at different temperatures minus
40 minus 20 You know room temperature also
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to do refrigerant 134 a which
Is you know totally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tetrafluoroethane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's has its own different Extraction
characteristics sealed a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of co2 co2 plus ethanol
co2 plus terpenes different ways of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the co2 and Then also another way that
we've been doing it is with modulated
[SPEAKER_00]: cavitation so modulated cavitation is a
process where you take the material mix it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a solvent that's either ethanol or
water or a combination of the two and you
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it through down to a quarter inch so
grind it down to a quarter inch then I
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it through a rotor that's that
allows me to do flows through cavitation
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can be able to modulate how much
cavitation I'm providing shockwave and
[SPEAKER_00]: then from there I have post-processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Analogy for this is is a garden So if I
have a garden and I go to the spicket I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a bucket Of water I bring it back to
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it on the garden I go back in
another bucket of water pour it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've done and That's
continuous batch batch Could be slower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I've developed is that by it they
them what we developed with another
[SPEAKER_00]: company out of Rome Georgia is a hose So
now it's more of taking that as a as a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous flow So on that side being able
to do on a small size say 12 pounds a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute On a very small footprint now the
small footprint means that I've still got
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed that beast So I'm doing it in
Oakland Oregon New Mexico Southern Cal
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I have larger facilities that would
be a remote refinery So my Oakland
[SPEAKER_00]: facility would allow me to show how it
works and then bring it out to a much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger facility where I can do 120 pounds
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oakland's almost like a showroom It's
almost like a little strip mall showroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but I'm still able to get great
yields out of there and And so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm I'm I'm doing that I'm also
doing refining there for pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: remediation as well as stripping THC out
of out of hemp Processes, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so with with the hemp farmers companies
brands that you're talking to like what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the questions they're peppering you
with when it comes to extraction it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting because the farmers are it's
everyone's swimming in their Lane
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's staying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I'm in lane number three
I'm I have lane two and one next to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four and five on the other side
Sometimes I think lane five has a shark
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, you know Richard
Dreyfuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting to go out on the phone
But when I'm going back through Their
[SPEAKER_00]: questions are I've got this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I prepare it for any type of
extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll have the big grows
in there saying well, I'd love to do
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol and I'm you know If you go back
and we're talking big hemp grows or big
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp grows and you go back through and you
and you Start to do the math for them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they realize that they're gonna need a
22,000 gallon ethanol tank outside to
[SPEAKER_00]: support what they believe they're going to
be doing so that's That's the other part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scenario where they'd want to do
it on site Or they have their own refinery
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want to do at their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay So they're asking you questions about
building out their own refinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, okay, and it's uh It's amazing the
number of people that will grow and then
[SPEAKER_00]: have way through their grow realizing that
they've got to extract it So and then
[SPEAKER_00]: where do you bring it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things that we talked about
yesterday even during the presentation was
[SPEAKER_00]: do you grow your own or do you find a
place that's outsourced that you can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: your material to that you feel confident
that they will provide you the extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need and for hemp Cultivators are
those facilities popping are reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities popping up around the country
to process there's reliable business
[SPEAKER_00]: models that are propping up around the
country and some of them are really making
[SPEAKER_00]: them so I would say that if you had four
or five in Kentucky that would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing because you need one in Lexington
you need one in Pulaski you need one in in
[SPEAKER_00]: in Louisville because of the number of
people growing if I was in Oregon I'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: one in Medford Salem Portland so if the
number of people that are in the bend See
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of places that that are growing
the major ones to have a refinery if I was
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying that there was one business model
that's out there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the most Profitable I would
I would start to build local refineries
[SPEAKER_00]: for hemp processing or just for anything
for hemp processing because once you So so
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go back to when I look at hemp so
cannabis has you know type 1 type 2 type 3
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot of people are starting to adopt
that so type 1 would be high THC low CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: type 2 would be you know 1 to 1 and type 3
would be a high CBD low THC so the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are are the same as far as what an extract
Or sees you know if I'm making if I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: and the different types of oranges I don't
really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a So for you from the extraction side
it doesn't matter whether it's hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's high THC cannabis The machine
looks at it the same way the machine has
[SPEAKER_00]: no idea so a car has no idea who the
driver is Right same thing and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have different types of cars you have a
Miata you have a you have a two-seater a
[SPEAKER_00]: four-seater you have a SUV and you have a
bus And if they're all going from Las Las
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas to LA and they're all at the same
Speed then they're all going to get there
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time But it's it's only the
difference in the number of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in it, and that's a yield type of
thing Okay, like like what what are some
[SPEAKER_01]: other?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like with the hemp world one
of the one of the major things is just the
[SPEAKER_01]: sheer scale Of the amount of bio material
all these farms are gonna have it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the same as a one acre cannabis farm So
The equipment is it just literally like
[SPEAKER_01]: you said for the ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting a 22,000 gallon What
stainless steel tank for the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to to do that so there's a
number of companies out there that that
[SPEAKER_00]: already do large-scale processing for the
Botanical materials, and I would say hop
[SPEAKER_00]: hops as a botanical material right and so
you know your industry uses a ton of Uses
[SPEAKER_00]: a ton and ton and tons of it and so
there's there's extractors up in Yakima
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like a Saturn You know three
rocket for gosh sakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's that's and they have the
processes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they make pellets They do this they
do that so they have that process down so
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were doing You know a cannabis on
the type one we didn't we didn't if anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: had that much material that would be
Amazing that would have the whole world's
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of THC in one day, but with hemp
and with the Use of CBD and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: products and so many box stores now It's
the extraction side is allows you to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that will provide a quality
product every time But the thing that that
[SPEAKER_00]: is most important for all the for people
to judge and that is what are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they're clean in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cleaning validation?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know that the person before me
didn't run pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: And somewhere it's somewhere in your
tubing so all of all those things when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an outsource That's a great idea for
for for monetary But you also have to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: them lots and lots of questions about the
cleaning and what their cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: Validation is and how they're doing that
So that actually raises a good point can
[SPEAKER_01]: you give in addition to that a couple
other questions that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone bringing raw material to an
extraction facility should ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great So number one they should
they should ask about the cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: validation So that's that's one the other
one is to be able to meet with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical engineers and the chemists that
know how to do the processing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction side and the post processing on
the backside So if you're doing a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: material or a couple tons of material
Extracting is almost the easiest part The
[SPEAKER_00]: second part is is how are you getting rid
of the ethanol because I've seen a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of companies all across the world That
will that will take a low THC You know
[SPEAKER_00]: less than the point three point one and by
the time they're done processing it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: five percent and the reason it's five
percent is because when you do a
[SPEAKER_00]: processing with CBDA and You do it with
ethanol or that sort of processing you you
[SPEAKER_00]: have such a high conversion over to Delta
9 So when you look at the molecule itself
[SPEAKER_00]: it will convert very quickly from CBDA to
THC through a couple number of steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even through a couple number of steps
you might have 48% CBD and 10% THC well
[SPEAKER_00]: You're well well over the limit,
and you made it yourself So you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask about you know how are they doing that
on a small scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what what's going to happen on a large
scale and put it into the contract it if
[SPEAKER_00]: they you know if they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemically convert it that you want to
have you know a way of reciprocity or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that allows you to go and do
that so I would say What do they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about thermodynamics?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They know about mass transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they know about the entire process
is is critical actually on that topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the locality?
[SPEAKER_01]: around I Bring my harvest to the
processor, and it's below the point What
[SPEAKER_01]: is it point zero three percent point three
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's below the point three percent and
they give me a final product That's above
[SPEAKER_01]: it is there is there any way to water it
down like so to speak or like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I just lose it like you know because
now it's illegal like I can't make a hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: or a CBD product that I can sell
nationally So so what's my next?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my recourse?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I salvage it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should have processes in place
that when it goes over that they know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring it down to that limit So there's
a number of different very very
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudimentary ways, so if you're at 53% CBD,
and you're at I'll make up 2% THC so
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process it just happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chemistry It just happens and so now
you want to have a way of bringing you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get rid of the THC But what you're
going to do is you're going to sacrifice
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your CBD So your 48% is going to
go down to 44 your 2% is going to go down
[SPEAKER_00]: to you know less than the point three But
so now somewhere in the contract You have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to say that if you have to go
back through and get rid of my THC And
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sacrificing some of my CBD You know
where's what's that price model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look like so somewhere in the contract you
have to be able to say when I get this
[SPEAKER_00]: back I want to have this amount of CBD
based on what I'm providing you for a plan
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you putting something in to?
[SPEAKER_01]: like what's the If the CBD is 40% in our
case study and the THC is 4% which is way
[SPEAKER_01]: above the point 3% What's the third?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingredient that's being added in to dilute
everything else so not so much a dilution,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more of a an absorption of both so
when you have your When you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: water filter on your on your local on your
sink in the kitchen And you're and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using that also for your for your drinking
water Well, you're collecting all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and the other things that are
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're collecting everything You know so
the same thing would happen here whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using diatomaceous earths a
combination of diatomaceous earth and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon black you know whatever that
concentration is and whatever temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: that's at you can add absorb Both the CBD
and the THC, but you're gonna absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else to everyone else is gonna
be in there so if your goal is to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: No THC, then you're gonna compromise the
rest of the entourage effect because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're only gonna get the CBD So you're
not adding something you're sending it
[SPEAKER_01]: through some sort of filtration to pull
things out Yes, ideally only THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we know other things So you're pulling
more THC out than for example the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: until you've gotten the THC down to point
three But you've lost a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff you have this basically the
filter now has or the sponge or the It
[SPEAKER_00]: does now somewhere in a contract you have
to know that those things can happen It
[SPEAKER_00]: will happen so now in that contract I
would you know put in some sort of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know closet says I that if you have to do
this what else Am I losing that I I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have just an isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have something with the other
components in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing that if you're doing
supercritical fluid chromatography So
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of super I often do that But keep
going continue What that will do is
[SPEAKER_00]: supercritical fluid chromatography will
separate out the THC you can take the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: out and keep all the CBD and all the
friends in there because you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: taking One component out very
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's a method So if in our
example, we're above the THC allowed limit
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another way to do it by and you
only take out the THC and you don't lose
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else Yes But it is since you
started by describing another methodology
[SPEAKER_01]: is the implication that this is a much
more expensive way to do it or yes So the
[SPEAKER_01]: your capital expenditure is much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people don't have the what was the
critical fluid chromatography?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have those machines No,
they don't okay, and there's other ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hear the centrifugal partition I'll
see countercurrent, but both the
[SPEAKER_00]: countercurrents Better just what well
actually just quickly what a question to
[SPEAKER_01]: this extraction facility a good question
be Do you have one of those machines on
[SPEAKER_01]: site because if they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they can resolve this problem Much
easier than if they don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: machine right or be or through a contract
say I don't care how you extract I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: care if my THC goes up because you're
gonna you're gonna Take it out anyhow,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't care what you do as long as you
give me back CBD and all my friends THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: less Yeah, and all my friends so some
people will make an isolate and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter because they're gonna get
Pure material, but you're gonna still want
[SPEAKER_00]: to as I'm thinking out loud You're still
gonna want to know I came in with 20% of
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry wine Great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all my terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones I want and I want you
to give me back You know my terpenes at
[SPEAKER_00]: this ratio with an acceptable amount loss
with no THC both That's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be able to match that
criteria So set up that contract on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you what you want and if they in most I
would think that most Extractors on the
[SPEAKER_00]: refineries the local refineries will be
fine with saying okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I can't do that I'm doing it this way I
can't give you that you know go to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: another one right and that's why it's
important to ask those questions So yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of honest feedback and answer
because you can't assume that they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna give you everything back you have to
have some Allowable loss you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some allowable Chemistry going on if you
don't have that it's I tell people that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you start off with even internally that
you're gonna lose 30% even on a good day
[SPEAKER_00]: if It's 20% that you're starting off with
you're not getting 20% of the concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna 30% goes somewhere your loss
losing it all the way to the process got
[SPEAKER_00]: it Expected you have to have expectations
that are reasonable for your investors
[SPEAKER_00]: because if they think it's 20 most people
on the investment side are Well-schooled
[SPEAKER_00]: on economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not well-schooled on extraction
nor do they world a Sorry, so now I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to so we've kind of that was like my hemp
conversation We obviously touched on their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get just right into old-school
cannabis extraction Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah with extraction you have Basically
come up with a new what was the not
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology, but process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I say cause more process more a
process so can you a talk about That
[SPEAKER_01]: process and then talk about you have kind
of the showroom of extraction types up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland So can you give me like walk me
through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Customer comes in and they want to do X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's bring you over to the alcohol
extraction machine Next customer comes in
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to do something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more appropriate for the co2
extraction machine Yes, so let's start
[SPEAKER_01]: with the new process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so on the new process is it's um
It's a technology that's been used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hops industry now for the last four or
five years so a lot of people in the hops
[SPEAKER_00]: industry are moving from the co2 which is
which is slower more selective to the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that allows them to do it
quicker, so almost all I'll say well over
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred now different brewers or hops
Manufacturers are using the technology all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way from the you know the craft beer
up To the you know larger beer
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers And so what happens with
that is you're trying to have it not have
[SPEAKER_00]: all the acids and the bitters and so this
technology what it does is it allows it to
[SPEAKER_00]: to break apart that the hops and at the
same time you know reduce some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha and beta acids, so then you bring it
towards cannabis and so on cannabis side
[SPEAKER_00]: an Extraction means that a that a solvent
goes into the into the trichome You take
[SPEAKER_00]: the material it's soluble and it Moves
outside the trichome and then moves on its
[SPEAKER_00]: way so the first part is thermodynamics
It's a solubility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a type of solvent and what it will
grab So much like so making a tea so if I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a teabag and I put it in I put it in
with ice There's not a lot of extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happening if I put it You know as I
increase the temperature of the water it
[SPEAKER_00]: allows me to get more components out So
that's how that shorter period of shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time and so when when I'm
looking at the cavitation what it does is
[SPEAKER_00]: it Does two things number one with the
modulated cavitation so not a shearing
[SPEAKER_00]: motor or ultrasound on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those they just everything gets
torn apart everything gets through sound
[SPEAKER_00]: waves everything gets burst but when
you're looking at the modulated one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a way of of bursting the trichome
without bursting the plant cell wall So
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm not getting a lot of the other
components that are sitting in like
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll like chlorophyll and all of
her friends and so what happens is I go
[SPEAKER_00]: back through with the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like breaking open egg and now it's
it's open to to the mass transfer of just
[SPEAKER_00]: moving along so So my analogy another
analogy So if I'm doing extraction and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get the dog out of the house I
got to go into the house find the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the dog back out if the dogs on the
front yard It's a lot easier to bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: dog and so when I'm bursting the trichome
the dog is out in the front yard It's free
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to find so when it's moving to that
process if I'm using water The
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are not soluble water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nonpolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now Using water as my as my media it
allows me to burst open the trichomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: material is free and then I have biomass
water and the Nonpolars the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: then I go through a horizontal decanting
centrifuge, which means I'm spinning it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the biomass Drops out and now I'm
just left with the oil in the water So my
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and water now I had to get rid of all
the other Small things that we can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: the fines and so I go through a disk stack
It's a centrifuge and therefore I'm able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of the fines and then my last
part is just a tri phase a decanter which
[SPEAKER_00]: is common in in the petroleum industry the
olive oil all these other things and so
[SPEAKER_00]: now what that does is that separates the
water from the From the oil so what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: left now with is everything that was open
from the trichome In the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done is it's not an
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually solventless Because I'm only
using the water as a solvent one more
[SPEAKER_00]: analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, so I go back through So my analogy
on that is I have waves the waves come in
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful time on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids are playing they got their sand
castles every year You're painting a good
[SPEAKER_00]: picture in my very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I raised the the waves I take out
the sand castles kids are crying time for
[SPEAKER_00]: a nap So now I can re-increase that or if
I'm a hurricane I have different style
[SPEAKER_00]: hurricanes where I can take out the first
row with all the beach houses or if I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: Tsunami I can take out the next almost
like you can create a more violent
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction sort of Process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me when do you want to use the
gentle waves versus the More you know me
[SPEAKER_00]: waves the tsunami so I can use the same a
technology and take the biomass Let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time I take out the sand
castles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take out That's my trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take out the sand castles, but I'm
leaving the house is okay So there's
[SPEAKER_00]: scanning electron microscope that shows it
I am doing what I said I'm gonna do The
[SPEAKER_00]: second part is is now that I've done that
and let's say I've gotten my cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything's wonderful So now we want
to raise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I want to take that biomass bring
it back through be more aggressive Break
[SPEAKER_00]: open the carbohydrates the polysaccharides
and now if I wanted to or through the
[SPEAKER_00]: second means You could make biofuel you
could make hempcrete You can take the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and beat it up more and then I can
come back around do the tsunami And then
[SPEAKER_00]: provide that as a biomass that can go back
on to the farmers land So, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm liking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this one machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can do a couple passes first pass
is the delicate pass that gets out all the
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially stuff that the cannabis
industry wants which is the oils Second
[SPEAKER_01]: pass I think gets to kind of I feel like
the disconnect in the marker right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: you know with hemp coming on this machine
and you think of hemp based biomaterials
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody really has the infrastructure to
get hemp to concrete or Like like the the
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure is not there but you're
saying with this machine and also people
[SPEAKER_01]: are growing varietals that Maybe they're
only doing oil extraction and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: tossing the rest of of the biomass and
you're saying We could basically it's
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like how you know, the Native
Americans would kill an animal and use
[SPEAKER_01]: every part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, whereas We kill an animal and we just
use a little part of it and throw the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: away Extraction number one is for the oil
Extraction number two could be for hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: concrete and Biofuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure Just like you get soy and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then extraction three could be
Making sure it's totally clean back to it
[SPEAKER_01]: to basically turn it into compost Yeah,
or put it back on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if it would be compost or
not But yeah, put it back on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be compost So I see a way so that
I've noticed there's a couple companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are a few companies out there that
are that are taking the people's Waste and
[SPEAKER_00]: then making it into hemp Crete through
other technologies There's other ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: make hemp Crete whether it's through acid
or whether it's through shearing motors or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever So there's other ways to do it,
but I'm finding that the big Hole in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is everyone's if you grow 7,000
acres of hemp and you only take that 10 15
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the oil Throw the rest away
What are you doing with all that waste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that waste going in in our United
States?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could use it for everything else
Use it for something else along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So We one of the things we talked about
before was like depending on what the
[SPEAKER_01]: person's end goal Is you'd use a different
process and technology and extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent What what would so you could let
let's say ethanol would be the best
[SPEAKER_01]: Process for whatever the person wants to
make as an end product So you could do
[SPEAKER_01]: like an ethanol extraction, but then throw
all the biomass back into what are we
[SPEAKER_01]: calling this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's shockwave, but it's part of shock
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah shockwave is the original one,
but we're calling it clean weight I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: respect but but am I thinking about this
correctly like you you could do Ethanol
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction as a first pass and then throw
it into the the clean wave Extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even it's for the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even better Okay, I can use the
ethanol as a solvent put it through the
[SPEAKER_00]: shockwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than doing any soaking at all
It's just going through as fast as the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made up a new word for that So the
first part is it's a separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is non solvent on the on the on the
water side so but That's a separation
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not using any solvent the
same thing can be done with each ethanol
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's going through the process But you
break open the trichomes so you're never
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a soaking step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do a soaking step It just goes
straight through so I call that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a separation plus an extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a separate action Clever but but
but point being we don't need to use two
[SPEAKER_01]: different machines here It can all be done
in the shockwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes slash clean wave extraction unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So So as you see kind of like extraction
the evolution of extraction equipment It
[SPEAKER_01]: is this like are the Eden labs of the
world going to be building these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: machines or Well, I have exclusive
patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ah, okay, but well wait, but but you
said this has been done in the hops Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the separate patents for hops versus a
separate patent Cannabis so you took
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you were seeing in the hops
space applied it to cannabis Cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: filed the patent on that so I've I have
exclusive rights to a patent from a
[SPEAKER_01]: company that allows them to do that Oh,
so someone else owns the patent and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the exclusivity in the cannabis
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, got it Okay, so but but then would
you license that out to other people to
[SPEAKER_01]: build the equipment you need or do you
want to be building the Equipment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be building the equipment as well
But I would be doing more of a leasing
[SPEAKER_00]: model to have other people take advantage
of the same thing because there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: places that outsourcing is Critical and
the people that are growing should be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing farmers know how to grow but
extraction isn't what they're doing So if
[SPEAKER_00]: I have someone as a dairy farm Then
they're providing the milk from the cow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then the cows can be used for yogurt
It can be used for cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for a lot of other things
So you just want to be the refinery for
[SPEAKER_00]: the dairy industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So It it seems like this is revolutionary
or at least evolutionary I would say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's evolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, because it's disruptive But it's
only because people haven't thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: this one way of doing it For the cannabis
industry and and there was no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: really to do it before Because there
wasn't enough material and the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: industry now changed all that changed So
the sheer scale of the introduction of
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp to the processing landscape is
changing things so that it looks And
[SPEAKER_01]: smells more like hops, which is produced
on you know, however many Budweiser's are
[SPEAKER_01]: sold in the world You need that much hops
to to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I would say that they probably
don't use that much oil but on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the same side though as I would
look at that is that now you also have the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabrication companies that are very used
to making large skids with a single
[SPEAKER_00]: software interface That can be used for I
mean you're using the same technology For
[SPEAKER_00]: for making sure eggs don't have you know
Microbials in it or you're making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're so it doesn't beat up the eggs
So enough so that they the egg whites turn
[SPEAKER_00]: into scrambled eggs You're just making
sure that it's cavitation enough and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the same sort of technology So
when I use water, I'm having to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger wave So I should I should say
more that my ethanol with with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cavitation would be more like taking out
the sandcastles My water means I'm having
[SPEAKER_00]: to go up a little further and take out the
houses right because I need a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more energy to break it up because ethanol
really is an extraction and So it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: aided in that the ethanol already swells
up a lot of the trichomes Some steam works
[SPEAKER_00]: because it bursts the trichomes and then
and then you you release the material It's
[SPEAKER_00]: not actually doing an extraction steam
isn't doing an extraction hot air is not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it's bursting trichomes so this is
another way of Making that the material
[SPEAKER_00]: more more available for the process got
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Mold mildew pathogens, how do you
make sure your water is clean as an input
[SPEAKER_01]: into this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well one way or the other the water is
going to pick up things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: water-soluble And so anything that's
water-soluble is going to be in the water
[SPEAKER_00]: layer Anything that's nonpolar is going to
be outside the water layer so having that
[SPEAKER_00]: separation there if I'm separating out the
water then I'm not going to get it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the Into the oil anyhow, I think the other
the other question would be if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: mold and mildew on the cannabis Is there a
way to remediate that into the final oil
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Products so when you're looking at meaning
you don't have that in the final product
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have that if it's if it's
insoluble and what if it's soluble in
[SPEAKER_00]: water it's going to stay in the water
layer if it's a size thing because those
[SPEAKER_00]: are Organisms, then you're going to pick
them up in your ears your your filtration
[SPEAKER_01]: step but I assume a lot of people in the
history of cannabis have had moldy weed
[SPEAKER_01]: and run it through extraction and it is
there a way to I know we don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight it as something to do but like
can you take moldy weed and Extract it and
[SPEAKER_01]: have no mold in the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I would do that is powdery
mildewy weed Yeah, so what I would do is
[SPEAKER_00]: is during that process the final step of
the oil I would make sure the oil is now
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a process A post process if
you wanted to to take out those those
[SPEAKER_00]: components So if I was to again if I do in
it by supercritical fluid chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going To last through that
because you're going to do the separation
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to only pull out what you
want and that's not that's not going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through that process So I think there's
different steps that allow you to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you're always making
something in a final product That's safe
[SPEAKER_00]: for the consumer but also safe for the
people that are working on the instrument
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me say it differently instead of
like a scenario where we have ungodly
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of mold and mildew Farmers will
have a little bit of those things on their
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and it's not Bad, I think
regulations kind of say you're not allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to have any of this any of that But at
least through extraction you can make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: there's zero of it versus in flower form
Yes, okay So the other part that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say is that it's the other parts of the
water that are Besides the pathogens that
[SPEAKER_00]: are more concerning like what's your ionic
strength?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in Midland, Texas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash was it Ashland?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like say Asheville, North Carolina
because that's still there and so now you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very different Water in Asheville
than you have in Medford, Oregon Or you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in Tacoma Washington or Yakima just
keep naming them So you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you have the consistency on that
you're gonna have to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-processing allows you to have that
window of acceptability of what the water
[SPEAKER_00]: would be same way I have a window of
acceptability of ethanol So when I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol my first pass on ethanol even if
it's 99% I'm bringing it back around from
[SPEAKER_00]: my second pass now I have 95% of bring it
around the third pass I got 90 so you not
[SPEAKER_00]: only have temperature of ethanol But you
also have that you're changing that
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol each time it comes around because
it's picking up moisture, right so The the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason I thought this technology was
exciting and why I became more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: enamored with it and picked up the
exclusive license for it was because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using wet plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting as close to the plant when you
harvest it that I can and that way I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a maximum amount of all the Compounds that
are in that plant at at time t yes right
[SPEAKER_00]: now I do time t and I dry it while I'm
losing this I move it across I'm losing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm just trying to get as close to
the plant as possible and then maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not significant maybe it is but at
least at some point in time I have
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's Started off there and
then you know if people need to take out
[SPEAKER_00]: other things or they find more parts that
are more Adventations and others that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine, too But I'm starting off with
something that's close to the plant or I
[SPEAKER_00]: can take a drive It doesn't matter where
the process is when I'm putting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to make an acceptable for the
process So if it's a dry plant I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrate it I'm gonna put it in a big 250
gallon stir with a great big stir And I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just gonna make sure it's hydrated so it
has water all the way back through it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'm going to do a processing so in
that scenario There's almost no reason
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody would send it through a drying
process in advance of sending it to you
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the only reason would be is that
they were very remote and they wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry it across large distances and they
didn't have a freezer truck and they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't and they didn't fresh frozen or
Lifelize it or something like that So
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you have on that side because I
think that that's as it grows having the
[SPEAKER_00]: refinery closer and closer to the farm now
For me is this something that's reality is
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: so Amazing along the way that we're not
going to find other plants or we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find other things that move
through Maybe it's maybe it's maybe it
[SPEAKER_00]: pops in three years, and you don't want
six thousand refineries Sitting out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that are that are vacant so that you
mentioned fresh frozen Can you touch
[SPEAKER_01]: because fresh frozen seems to be gaining
market share so can you talk about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a more specific way What well what are
you seeing like are you involved in in
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Processing at all I'm involved in Yes,
okay, so the quick answer is yes so people
[SPEAKER_00]: who would want to to take part of their
crop and Experiment with fresh frozen I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: finding most people won't take the entire
crop for fresh rose And they'll take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and say I don't know does this
work or not work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in a put it in a freezer,
and that's where it sits so a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: work Now I've already done the dry work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's there's plenty of dry material I
figured out that one that went pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and but now the fresh frozen How
do you get it so you make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: get it down to a quarter inch size?
[SPEAKER_00]: So through a grinding process that doesn't
stall up because it's wet and those things
[SPEAKER_00]: are readily available out in the industry
We're just repurposing them for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore that's how I do my process
flow stream them together quarter inch
[SPEAKER_00]: size keep moving but The dry how long do
you dry it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do I stir it and then bring it
through the same process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of those are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just that the pre-processing is a
little bit different I will say one more
[SPEAKER_01]: thing sorry and so on fresh frozen or on
something else, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: What what so I was gonna say wrapping up
fresh frozen like what what are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it seems like something you said
people allocate a part of their crop But
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems like that's gonna can that's a
trend that's gonna continue right to
[SPEAKER_01]: expand at all and that it may may not but
From a processing standpoint is it just in
[SPEAKER_01]: that pre-processing that for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's any difference and then it just
becomes the same as anything else you're
[SPEAKER_00]: handling It's the same as anything else
except for the ingredients that are and
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in it the compounds that you're
going to get from fresh frozen are
[SPEAKER_00]: different from the ones that I see from
the dry and What are those compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly when you're when you're drying
them off if you're not capturing the
[SPEAKER_00]: turpines?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing 62% of your turpines just
through the drying process especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: More volatile ones you're you're changing
some of the plant dynamics the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: still living by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you're still getting Acetone you're
still getting prithrin because it's a You
[SPEAKER_00]: get it from chrysanthemums, but prithrin
Cannabis makes prithrins as its own
[SPEAKER_00]: protection right so you have all those
different parts that are in there you also
[SPEAKER_00]: have a concentration of of your of your
acids so you have a lot more of the acids
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't know if it's a trend or
whether it's different, but you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more of the CBG And then so in fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah post processed material then yeah,
okay So that's interesting so it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's one of the reasons why people
are doing fresh frozen is to Capture as
[SPEAKER_01]: much of what was in the plant on its very
last day alive Yes as possible yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and and you're from a processing
standpoint seeing that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientifically like yes, that is actually
accurate it is You are seeing more
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids more more variety of
cannabinoids and terpenes that We're not
[SPEAKER_00]: losing because it's being dried first or
it's in the time that it's gone through
[SPEAKER_00]: that process So time is not only the
drying but from time t.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changing so I find that Also,
so now to go back through and support it
[SPEAKER_00]: through you know LCMS You know high
technology stuff to show what the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences are and are they important or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're important or not I
because we can't do all that medical
[SPEAKER_00]: research the United States because it's
federally legal It's a whole nother
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation of the conversation You're
gonna make one last point on something
[SPEAKER_01]: that wasn't fresh frozen probably wasn't
the one last point But there's I go back
[SPEAKER_00]: through and I see the I can use the same
device for making micro emulsions So once
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the oil I can Whatever the solvent
is let's say it's water I can make her
[SPEAKER_00]: micro emulsion so when people talk me like
nano size well micro so not nano size
[SPEAKER_00]: because a nano emulsion most of the time
what people do is a is a and I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the actual Specifications are but
it's based on size and whether you can
[SPEAKER_00]: call it nano or micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a size So it's a size up from nano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, okay, and so when I'm looking at that
It's a matter of of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no water soluble cannabinoids
that that can't happen So they talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: water so but it's actually just emulsions
so you can't tell that it's not mixed It's
[SPEAKER_00]: just that they're so small that you you it
looks Like it's dissolved The second part
[SPEAKER_00]: on that one is even though it looks like
you can still see through it There's other
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific ways of seeing whether it
really is You know still in there are as
[SPEAKER_00]: clung to the side of the glass or whatever
container plop So you can use the same
[SPEAKER_00]: technology Where I go back to the oil and
water and I can go back through and make
[SPEAKER_00]: micro emulsions out of the same technology
So I can use it for the first part of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the extraction call it extraction
for lack of a better word and so but Then
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also use it after I've done the
field now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make other products I can use it for
emulsifying the lotion for emulsifying an
[SPEAKER_00]: ointment for emulsifying a tincture for so
you can use the technology Not just on the
[SPEAKER_00]: first part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the other part that made me
Interested in it and where I found it and
[SPEAKER_01]: so basically the concept of emulsifying
The the are we emulsifying the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, okay, and that's making everything
smaller So is the point there that it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes more bioavailable?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to be bioavailable that but
you might take that same emulsion and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a liposomal Or a mice cellular so
you can add surfactants or other part that
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on what people want to have for
their final product again But you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in with you know tween and twain and
all these other surfactants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already being used in all of our other
foods and our You know our salad dressings
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to make it Content
uniformity is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have everything exactly the
same so part of why you would emulsify the
[SPEAKER_01]: oil as a final step is to have uniformity
of distribution of all the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpenes Yeah, okay, so that if I'm if
I'm like squirting it into into Vape tanks
[SPEAKER_01]: that every tank gets the same mixture of
yes of full spectrum plant good,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you got to make sure From batch to
batch so that one batch may be Contents
[SPEAKER_00]: and that that brings in a whole nother
thing of inline testing and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that right cool all right well John We
will continue the conversation up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, all right you Cheers.
Huh.
Cheers.
