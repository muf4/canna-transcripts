[SPEAKER_00]: You're always looking for the latest and
greatest techniques, the best ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: most efficient ways to train, and I really
felt that cannabis opened up my mind to
[SPEAKER_00]: see things very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys take it in a very black and
white approach as far as how they train
[SPEAKER_00]: for a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in, you hit pads, you spar,
and that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked seeing it as more of a creative
process, so for that reason cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly as far as recovering from
fights and recovering from heavy training
[SPEAKER_00]: sessions and whatever injuries I had,
it was very important for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also didn't sleep well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, getting ready for a
fight of another dude who is training
[SPEAKER_00]: across the world and getting ready to beat
you up, that can be a pretty stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes sleeping was difficult for me
because I'm an analyzer to a fault,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd be thinking about how I should be
approaching this fight or what I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing or watching video and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did help me relax a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it gets tricky, especially now in
the UFC, is that they do have drug
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they had more drug testing when I
was fighting because a lot of guys in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion were using a lot of PEDs back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the fight game now, USADA is
involved in testing protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're not preparing for a fight,
let's say, I think it's like seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within seven days, you can't use
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a non-training camp or
you're not getting ready for a fight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that they're just seeing it
now like that is a big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than when I was fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they are seeing more benefits
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're opening up their mind more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, when I was fighting,
if you were caught using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would be suspended for three months,
six months, sometimes a year or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in mixed martial arts, when I was
fighting, you weren't making a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't guys that are making millions
and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have the potential to kind of make
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, it really wasn't like
that unless you were an elite fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know on a lot of fighters, testing
positive for something, you're out for a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, you're not going to be able to pay
the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are changing in a positive
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even a lot of fighters that are
now being sponsored by CBD companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: different camps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very different landscape than
it was even three, five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
