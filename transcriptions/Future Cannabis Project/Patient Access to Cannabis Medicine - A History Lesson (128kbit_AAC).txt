[SPEAKER_05]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patient access, kind of a history of
patient access with a focus on Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_05]: and a little bit the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we will talk about the current
state of patients and access to medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis in 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's kick it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Sarah Armstrong, if you want
to kind of start with a little history
[SPEAKER_05]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safe access came very late to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1996, the Compassionate Use Act was
passed and immediately in the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_00]: places started opening up, most notably
the Berkeley Patients Group, which Don
[SPEAKER_00]: Duncan was a founding member of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: was people kept trying and people kept
getting rated and closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of you who have been around
for a while remember the Yellow House or
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott Emler's operation in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until 2005 when we had our first
stable group of dispensaries and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: all in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And West Hollywood was very welcoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Duncan, who had been part of the
Berkeley Patients Group, came to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and opened LAPCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked with others to get an ordinance
in West Hollywood and then turned his
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was already an activist with 10 years'
experience in the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who have never met
him, he's a very short-haired,
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative-looking guy, but very,
very engaging and upbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went and negotiated with Dennis Zyna
Councilman, at that time, who was a former
[SPEAKER_00]: cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end result of that was something
called the pre-ICO list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, today, one of your guests,
Michael Backus, was on that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: He founded Cornerstone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so people know, when people who
were really sick came into our
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, we sent them to Cornerstone
because we knew that they would get the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of care that people who are really
sick and not going to be around in a year
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's one of my great heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-ICO list invited anyone who was
operating in the city to come forward and
[SPEAKER_00]: register.
[SPEAKER_00]: The promise was that you would get an
ordinance down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took from 2007 to 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that period, all of these
people who came forward, most all of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: were rated at least once.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LAPD was not shy about this activity,
and the DEA came every summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the first ordinance came forward in
2010, it was fatally defective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things, it gave people only
something like a month to find a location
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be compliant with their
sensitive uses, which, if any of you have
[SPEAKER_00]: ever looked for a dispensary, you know you
never get a lease in just one month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another real big problem was they wanted
all cannabis to be tested, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: insisting that it be a certified LAPD,
which means it's a federal LAPD
[SPEAKER_00]: certification, and it cannot be done at
the local level because at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, marijuana is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What followed then were a series of
ordinances.
[SPEAKER_00]: ASA was the first to sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sued in 2010 on the original ordinance,
but there were other lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, things got so bad that a
consortium on the city council,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've always had between three and
five real opponents, forced through a ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 2012 and 2013, the retail
operators in Los Angeles came together
[SPEAKER_00]: with a meaningful assist from UFCW Local
770.
[SPEAKER_00]: They originally had their ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We abandoned it in favor of the city's
ordinance, which came to be known as Prop
[SPEAKER_00]: D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passed, and for the first time,
we had stability, and for the next three
[SPEAKER_00]: years, everybody was under what's called
limited immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limited immunity is just a system where if
you're accused of wrongdoing, you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into court and say, you know what,
I was following the rules the city said I
[SPEAKER_00]: should follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened with all this was a real
retardation in terms of any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: development for cultivators, for
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were to claim limited immunity,
they had to be part of a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, and they were the patient
providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this meant was that we were kind of
screwed up because there was no real
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it existed at all, it was kind of
underground, and sort of not too together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led finally to Prop M, which was
launched by the UCBA in tandem with the
[SPEAKER_00]: UFCW.
[SPEAKER_00]: They abandoned their voter initiative in
good form and signed onto the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really how you got Measure M,
which for the first time held out the hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could have a true industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concurrent with that, there was a real
problem in that the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: finally decided to regulate, and everybody
and their dog decided to tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we finally had stability and the
promise of licensing and the promise of an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, it rapidly became so expensive
for operators to exist that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: passing costs onto patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was very little relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of California also did some very
nasty things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got rid of the compassion programs
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fought back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an ongoing dialogue with the
state, but the kind of regulation that you
[SPEAKER_00]: see nowadays is way too much and way too
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Los Angeles, we self-regulated the
dispensary self-regulated for many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a code of conduct, which they had
to follow, which was put forward by GLACA,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Greater Los Angeles Collective
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't ever remember going into a
shop that was dirty or poorly staffed or
[SPEAKER_00]: had any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my point of view, one of the main
bars to safe access right now is not
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dispensary operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the taxes and regulation that have
pushed them into a very bad place and
[SPEAKER_00]: forced them to pass on a lot of the costs
to the patients, making safe tested
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, cannabis very difficult to come
by in a price range that the average
[SPEAKER_00]: person who's ill can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concurrent with this, there has been a
huge upsurge in delivery and retail
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that are unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeated journalist exposes have tested
the products in these shops and found them
[SPEAKER_00]: to be contaminated with a lot of very
dangerous things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For patients, it's particularly dangerous
because if you're really sick,
[SPEAKER_00]: you often have a compromised immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the best example of this was the
great leader of GLACA, Yanni Bolanos,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a transplant recipient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get the transplant to work,
they have to suppress the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that anything that's
sold to a patient be very, very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the city council voted to support a
system called the state bill, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: allow law enforcement to test cannabis at
licensed cannabis labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're thinking is to avoid the war on
drugs 2.0, keep this as a civil nuisance
[SPEAKER_00]: abatement, but factor in the fact that if
you're found to be selling poison to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public, you're going to face some fines
that are really spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the reactivation of the compassion
program, I guess it was in March,
[SPEAKER_03]: how effective has it been?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm asking in the context of a
pandemic, which was like the instigation
[SPEAKER_03]: for us wanting to have this conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients, it's hard enough with the taxes,
how are they surviving in the current
[SPEAKER_03]: situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: In that context, how's the compassion
program doing anecdotally from y'all?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, as far as I can tell, people are
trying, but it is a very difficult time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One shop is starting a compassion program
specifically for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the bigger shops that do a lot of
volume have instituted some very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: discounts for senior citizens and
veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there is a very famous
compassion program that's run for
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans, and I think they are up and
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: As nearly as I can tell in Los Angeles,
people badly want to reinstate their
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion programs, but the coronavirus
is just screwing everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody else have any insights?
[SPEAKER_06]: You really have to ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been in a lot of shops where
they're asking you, ask us about our
[SPEAKER_06]: compassion program.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's relatively new, and I think
it's going to take a little while to take
[SPEAKER_06]: hold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I think there's been a real sea
change among ownership of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be true mom and pops.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you how many dispensaries in
LA, where I used to know the owners well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, they've been basically bought by
charitably hedge fund guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, they've changed their pricing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've gotten much more aggressive on
their markups.
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be basically everything was
keystone.
[SPEAKER_06]: When a dispensary bought something,
they basically just doubled the price like
[SPEAKER_06]: most retailers do.
[SPEAKER_06]: These days, the average is 2.7 times
markup, and that's dramatic increase.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying, oh, well, that's because
we have to pay taxes on the product,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the math doesn't really work out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think California cannabis industry is
really suffering some issues that predate
[SPEAKER_06]: the pandemic, but were exacerbated by the
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be a little while
till we're out of the woods, until these
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses are a little healthier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that really impacts patient
access.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then also, the truth is most dispensaries
really don't train their staff
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly well.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've often been very compassionate
towards patients, but they can't really
[SPEAKER_06]: help patients because they don't know
what's in the products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in a big fancy dispensary the other
day and I asked some really basic
[SPEAKER_06]: questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: The staff looked at me like, it was like
asking a cow.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were some example questions that you
were asking?
[SPEAKER_06]: How much are these clones?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have terpene testing listed on every
one of your products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who does the terpene testing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the cultivator do it or does the lab
do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do these change batch to batch?
[SPEAKER_06]: They were listing at all the varieties and
then the three predominant terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, in my experience, those can
move a little bit crop to crop depending
[SPEAKER_06]: on storage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically,
[SPEAKER_06]: what I was asking is, is this information
accurate and proven?
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a reasonable question
because if I walk into CVS and ask to see
[SPEAKER_06]: their COA for Valium, they have one.
[SPEAKER_06]: These places just aren't really in the
medicine business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're right, Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state doesn't require a dispensary to
train their staff.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, but not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally, it's going to be the
public that demands the dispensaries train
[SPEAKER_06]: their staff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the problem is you got to educate the
public too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's responsibility,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel very responsible in making sure
you track your products, you label them
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly, but they're okay with letting
anyone step into a dispensary and pretend
[SPEAKER_01]: to know how it works as medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, they don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: CVS has licensed pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The classic thing is basically the
distinguishing factors for recommending
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine to patients are indica and
sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I said, I was on this Frenchy
cannoli thing the other day and I said
[SPEAKER_06]: that indica and sativa is as good at
predicting effect as thinking you can tell
[SPEAKER_06]: the taste of a nut by looking at the shape
of the tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: These people have no scientific background
at all and they're not trained.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really pointing fingers at them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that we've got to change that
culture because people are coming in
[SPEAKER_06]: asking for medicine and it'd be really
great if the complete responsibility
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't on the patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I tried to do back at
Cornerstone was start to change that
[SPEAKER_06]: equation by making my staff read papers
and understand some of the more technical
[SPEAKER_06]: details of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I agree completely with you,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, going back to the patient,
the patient is experiencing the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we asking the patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day I talk to patients and I ask
them what their effect is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one's really asking or collecting
that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've begun to do so that we
can correlate the active ingredients,
[SPEAKER_01]: the active product ingredients with an
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty simple thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can crowdsource and find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for the regulatory practices to
have that involvement rather than it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: about THC getting high and being worried
about adverse events like driving THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be the focus of any
research, but really what we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at early at the characteristic
effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis science still suffers from the
NIDA on down, which is, as Nora Volkow,
[SPEAKER_06]: who's the head of the National Institutes
of Drug Abuse said, that we're not the
[SPEAKER_06]: National Institutes of Drug Use.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just are into how it's abused and
therefore, that's what our research is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to focus on, focus on abuse.
[SPEAKER_06]: To this day, it's improved a little bit,
but not much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most universities are scared to death of
doing cannabis research because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: afraid they're going to lose their DEA
license, which they need to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the local level, I go in all the time,
show my driver's license and make a little
[SPEAKER_00]: buy, talk to the bartenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most unfortunate things is they
really don't know their medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they sure know how to upsell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very sales oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a patient and you're sick,
most likely you don't have all the money
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're being told, oh, well,
if you need this effect, you have to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: Y amount of money, that's a hard thing to
hear when you're really sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: The truth is, the really inexpensive
medicines, because I've seen this before,
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen compassion programs that
basically scoop from the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_06]: barrel to help patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: The truth is, patients often need the
cannabis that's in the best shape,
[SPEAKER_06]: not the cannabis that's indifferently
cultivated and has been poorly stored and
[SPEAKER_06]: was grown a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've fought with partners and dispensers
to raise the quality of medicine that is
[SPEAKER_06]: provided under compassion programs,
because I think that often, patients don't
[SPEAKER_06]: need one more problem, which is to get
indifferently produced cannabis and try to
[SPEAKER_06]: use it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: If patients, and I'm one of them and I
totally concur, if you cannot derive that
[SPEAKER_03]: information that you need from the
budtender at the dispensary, where do you
[SPEAKER_03]: get it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alice, where do you go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you go and get the data and
information?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a patient myself, I just thank you for
pointing me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to say, I have cerebral
palsy and my wife has multiple sclerosis
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're both on SSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have all the money in the world
to spend on quality care.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically had to create our own
platform called wearerollingstone.com to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out which medicines were doing the
good stuff and that we could say,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, I had no adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically been through that platform
that I've been able to meet people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are giving the good medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally, they'll throw me a bone,
but I feel like there's not enough of that
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about money, money, money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really about healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain places like 3C Farms
that are doing really great things with
[SPEAKER_02]: their medicines, but that's few and far
between, especially here in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started medicating in 2007,
I could tell you that half the time I
[SPEAKER_02]: would panic when I was medicating and I
was medicating to stop seizures at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was large points in time where I
would stop medicating because it would
[SPEAKER_02]: defeat the purpose of why I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once everything got regulated,
I could medicate with whatever I want,
[SPEAKER_02]: however much I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sky's the limit, but it's crazy,
crazy unaffordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's places like CaliHash, there's 3C
Farms, Raw Garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you just have to find people that
are maybe having more or less the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: ground in their pricing, but are also
doing that top quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't really talk about it at all to
the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you were saying, I mean, I hate it
when I go in and talk to whoever,
[SPEAKER_02]: people that I know and I say, well,
what about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's great because there are
extract companies now that are,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, extracts are really put through
the mill because what it is is that if
[SPEAKER_06]: they get bad cannabis, that problem gets
concentrated in the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's good is when you get a clean
concentrate, and you get companies that
[SPEAKER_06]: really know how to make them, the good
news is that it often could provide more
[SPEAKER_06]: affordable medicine to patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I really like Raw Garden because
they're inexpensive and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know how to protect terpene content,
though often the retailers don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the thing is that as medicine,
cannabis should be kept cold, and it
[SPEAKER_06]: rarely is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And extracts are even more delicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you're using extracts as a
medicine, you kind of have to find people
[SPEAKER_06]: that understand that the supply chain,
it's more like produce than it is
[SPEAKER_06]: cardboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you have to, just like you wouldn't
leave a head of lettuce out for four
[SPEAKER_06]: months, you probably don't want to leave a
cannabis extract at room temperature for
[SPEAKER_06]: four months because a lot of it's going to
break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the breakdown happen over four months
or is it gradual over that time,
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael?
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, in the case of some of the
lighter monoterpenes like myrsine,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can lose half of your myrsine content
in less than 45 days if you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: refrigerate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my recommendation for people who
use cannabis as a medicine is don't assume
[SPEAKER_06]: it's been handled correctly before it gets
to you, but take responsibility once it
[SPEAKER_06]: does.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I do is I recommend you keep your
cannabis in the freezer and just take out
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't let it thaw.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of it like ice cream, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why Raw Garden is as good as
they are because they use that fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: frozen technique.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of people are now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the thing is, if you're using
hydrocarbon extraction, you want to use
[SPEAKER_06]: fresh frozen cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason is, it's just how the
extraction machines work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've gotten really into extraction
technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, I mean, I bought a low
temperature freezer that keeps everything
[SPEAKER_06]: at minus 76.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you extract, you extract at
120 degrees below zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that does is that allows you to
make high turn for your extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's these high terpene cannabinoid
combinations that I find have the most
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal efficiency, whether you're
talking about THC or CBD or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're getting the whole plant
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting fresh frozen whole plant
that way, correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really, it's a really fascinating
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was on here basically to talk
about cornerstone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cornerstone started.
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew nothing about the science.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't find anything with CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I ever got a plant that
supposedly had CBD in it, we went through
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole crop cycle to find out that the
person was mistaken.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd given us Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we tested it, it was pure THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we found out when we like,
we were so excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got our first crop of CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave it to a bunch of people and they
immediately called within hours and go,
[SPEAKER_06]: man, I'm really stoned.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those kind of misfires.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when we started looking at it,
looking for CBD down in Southern
[SPEAKER_06]: California, Northern California was
already ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so folks like Martin Lee and Fred
Garner, who formed Project CBD,
[SPEAKER_06]: work with Garner's like Wayne Loft,
Wayne Lofter and Lawrence Ringo and these
[SPEAKER_06]: guys who were the first people to find
plants that had any CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is before the pure CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: The story of CBD in the West is really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if a lot of people know
it, but what happened was a kid bought a
[SPEAKER_06]: kilo of New York East Coast sour diesel
seeds from Soma in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't pay for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Went down to Spain and grew out a bunch of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of those seeds became the pure CBD
line, which was called Kanatonic when it
[SPEAKER_06]: was in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it was stolen and brought to
Northern California, they renamed it ACDC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the Stanley brothers stole it and
they took it to Colorado and they called
[SPEAKER_06]: it Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing is is that, I mean,
but that's not like pointing fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: People lift genetics historically all the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there were these groups of type two
genetics like Harlequin that were THC and
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when ACDC first showed up,
that revolutionized California cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: because that led to it being used as an
effective treatment for epilepsy and
[SPEAKER_06]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people started to ask, what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Gupta does the CNN special and it
takes off.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the early days when I was just
starting in like 2007, we didn't know
[SPEAKER_06]: anything about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ethan Russo wrote a paper about it in
2008, 2009 that I just devoured.
[SPEAKER_06]: But until Steep Hill opened up in the Bay
Area, there was no place to test cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: in California for a cannabinoid or terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Steve D'Angelo, the best thing he ever
did was he got ahead of the curve in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis science in California and he
opened the first lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that led to the formation of
other labs, folks from Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steep Hill went and formed SC labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today there are a lot of reasonably
decent labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some pretty bad ones, but there
are some good ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that allows us to know what's in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I started at Cornerstone,
we didn't know, but we're really trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: pay attention to our patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also I'm into super exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was always trying to find land races
and weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of those proved to be reasonably
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this note here, medicine then and
now, which is what you're speaking to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you feel as though you understand
the medicinal properties of the products
[SPEAKER_03]: you're dealing with better now than you
did back in 2007?
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, we have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the thing is, is that our
understanding, the thing is, is now that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're starting to understand that the
endocannabinoid system in the body does
[SPEAKER_06]: not just consist of endocannabinoid
receptors like CB1 and CB2 or the notional
[SPEAKER_06]: CB3.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that it's actually interacting with a
ton of different receptor systems,
[SPEAKER_06]: serotonin, dopamine, it goes on and on,
the TRIP receptors, the thermoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you start to see that these
combination of plant chemicals are hitting
[SPEAKER_06]: all of these different receptor systems,
in the body, and that's actually
[SPEAKER_06]: responsible for the pharmacology of
cannabis and how it's working as a
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody like Alice is looking for
results.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just now coming out of the mist with
doctors like our doctor here, starting to
[SPEAKER_06]: ask the questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're starting to see is we're
applying chemistry to outcomes and
[SPEAKER_06]: starting to see patterns, but we have a
long way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the bottom line is it's still
trying to stick a spear in a barrel and
[SPEAKER_06]: get the right fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, John, you had mentioned before
we started that you wrote your first
[SPEAKER_05]: prescription while you were in residency
and you thought it was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk about the change in
perception?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the change for me came from the
patients that I saw through the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a doctor's point of view,
we rely on clinical trials, randomly
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled double-blind trials to prove
that something is medicine, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been very, very few clinical
trials on cannabis and that's due to
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a doctor, I've had to switch gears and
just take one patient at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the 20 years of talking to patients,
I've seen miracles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what convinced me that there is
something happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, how am I going to convince
other doctors that there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to start doing these clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: That requires, number one, consistent
medicine from the manufacturers and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the appropriate studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to take these miracle cases
and pull them all together into clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials so that we can prove that there's
actually something happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, to your average doctor,
cannabis is not proven medicine at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sad part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these years and we're still at
step one.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the biggest things is when you see
these Cochrane reviews of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids for different conditions,
they always say, oh, the studies were too
[SPEAKER_06]: small.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are any trials at all,
they're always too small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you envision a time when we can do the
large-scale studies that the establishment
[SPEAKER_06]: appears to demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding the right product is the first
step.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like hunting for a needle in a
haystack to find that one product and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of variability in patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's got a different genetic makeup
and different metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a many-to-many problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our approach, I founded a research
organization five years ago, the Clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: Endocannabinoid System Consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing is we're taking the
approach of starting with the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crowdsourcing information so that can
direct us toward finding that needle in
[SPEAKER_01]: the haystack and then moving forward with
that magic product and truly testing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for specific indications like pain or MS
or diabetes, whatever claims that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we envision it and we believe that
our approach in working backwards
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, sampling the huge amount of
patients right now that are taking
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine or taking cannabis and figuring
out which ones are having some effect and
[SPEAKER_01]: then starting from there to do the
randomly controlled double-blind trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask Alice a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Alice, have you seen your outcomes
improve?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's made the biggest difference for
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I said, I used to get here in
Los Angeles before all the regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: went down, I would get cannabis that I
knew was probably grown by the guy that
[SPEAKER_02]: owned the dispensary at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Mother Nature's Remedy,
I believe they were called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you would just get cannabis with a
label, what the strain name was,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was much cheaper then, but the effect
was I would have panic attacks often,
[SPEAKER_02]: which who knows what I was inhaling,
all the stuff that wasn't lab tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it was only about, I would say about
two or three years that I've been able to
[SPEAKER_02]: get somewhat affordable medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is regulated and it's just like my
body has never felt better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smoke most everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still prefer sun-grown cannabis because
I feel like there's more therapeutic
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect to it as far as terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like indoor medicine is very
strong, but it depends on what kind of day
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have what's called spastic depletia
cerebral palsy, so I have a constant body
[SPEAKER_02]: stiffness slash twitch, and I'm always
tired because I'm always moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a balance of medicine that's going
to relax my body, but also keep me awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a fine balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas my wife, she has multiple
sclerosis and she can medicate all day
[SPEAKER_02]: long and have the strongest stuff and
still be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I started Rolling Stone is
because my wife was doing so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel without it, she'd just be better
and she's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to be our own advocates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulated medicine has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just as far as actually making it
affordable to patients, it's a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you hearing from other patients and
other people who are also having similar
[SPEAKER_03]: problems paying for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any in your community that you
can- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a lot of people where they'll
go with a lesser product or they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily maybe get the right med.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, you find the right med and
then all of a sudden it's not there
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore or there's an issue with getting
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I feel like so many people with
disabilities and severe illnesses,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis doesn't even enter their mind to
be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why when I started my platform,
I was like, I don't know, I'm an actor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I should get involved in
this, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there were so many people that I
already thought were already on that train
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still learning and we're not even at
step one, I think, as far as people with
[SPEAKER_02]: disabilities and illnesses go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I teach from a standpoint of
very basic because most people don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I'm talking about, which is sad
because the basic treatment for someone
[SPEAKER_02]: like me would probably be Valium,
Baclofen, any of those type medicines
[SPEAKER_02]: where I would have a lesser quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: John, you're about to say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of my experiences outside of the
crisis, the consistency as Alice just
[SPEAKER_01]: pointed out, she's looking for a medicine,
she finds the right medicine, and then she
[SPEAKER_01]: goes back and it's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, I followed patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was following a little girl with Lennox
Gustav's seizures, similar to Charlotte of
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were getting wonderful results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then one day the seizures came back and we
didn't change the dose or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, we found out that the medicine
had changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely, we were following CBD,
but because terpenes may be involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes likely changed the effect of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistency and proper labeling were
required, but I don't think the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles are completely required in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were all saying, we've got a long
way to go in really understanding this and
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that the whole plant,
all the active ingredients are considered
[SPEAKER_01]: for our patients' sake.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really where I think advocacy
groups and the state need to get involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in focusing on the patient and making sure
that they're getting the best medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than taxing them and making sure
that they fill the state's coffers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be more important to push toward
true medical research.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it'd be great if we could actually
get some movement behind the
[SPEAKER_06]: not-for-profit medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is that, I mean, when I first
got into this, the gold standard was wham
[SPEAKER_06]: up in the Santa Cruz, which was for
hospice patients, terminal hospice
[SPEAKER_06]: patients that only provided the meds free
to those patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great, but the problem is,
it was very, very self-limiting because
[SPEAKER_06]: you can only really meet the needs of X
number of patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good news is I think that the
technology that's used to both cultivate
[SPEAKER_06]: and extract cannabis is getting really,
really efficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that it may actually make a
non-profit dispensary viable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've got to stop fooling
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, medical cannabis
post-regulation in California has done the
[SPEAKER_06]: same thing it's done in every state that's
seen adult use regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically cratered.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because everybody's trying to recoup
their investments and make their investors
[SPEAKER_06]: happy and all this crap, and the patients
suffer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that the thing that really is
we should really start to treat this like
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine, and medicine that we need to
make affordable for patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really going to be challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm down if you guys want to start
that non-for-profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of years left in me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't mean I'm not down for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something I'd love to spend more time
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work with a dispensary in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been really challenging there
because it's so highly regulated that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: really expensive to produce medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in California, Central Valley has lots
of room to grow non-for-profit cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know everyone was a collective and
not-for-profit up until a certain point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like everything shifted in the
other direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could one be a not-for-profit retail shop
in California?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think Sarah may be able to address
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think so because with the recent
changes in state laws, with the return of
[SPEAKER_06]: the compassion programs, I think there
actually is room now for this to get some
[SPEAKER_06]: traction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it just takes willpower right
now and money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take some money to set it
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not going to be all the fancy
flavored products.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be looking at this as a
medicine and saying, OK, what are the
[SPEAKER_06]: ingredients we really need?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do the patients need?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how can we get those formulations to
patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's kind of bare bones.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be very generic.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it'd be highly effective
because chemistry is chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average patient kind of maybe wants
generic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with a lot of how it is now when
you go on dispensaries, there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: brands that you get intimidated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get generic stuff, it makes it
easier for the patient, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and remember the first generic
products in the grocery store with the
[SPEAKER_06]: white boxes and the blue letters?
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it's literally THC, CBD,
Miracene, and Lemonine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the numbers on the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you take it from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who knows?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's a business opportunity for
somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and the fact is now brands are,
you don't know what's in that brand just
[SPEAKER_03]: because it has a brand on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be sourcing from other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know for a fact they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't necessarily know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bud tender may not know.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one in that shop may know exactly
what's in that jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and also a sad truth is a lot of the
labs that are testing the medicine are
[SPEAKER_06]: incentivized to provide the results that
the people who are paying for the testing
[SPEAKER_06]: want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore my concern is sometimes,
like for example, some of these labs are
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene testing and they get results that
don't line up with the genetics of what
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant can actually produce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a big deal because it means
that the results, if they even get to the
[SPEAKER_06]: patient, will incorrectly inform them
about the constituency of the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's awful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so more oversight over lab testing in
California, this is the right time for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if we really want to start to
talk about this as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not knowing what's in your product can
really be problematic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I think it's important to
talk about it for patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, are you there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are those the types of conversations
that ISA is having with the state about
[SPEAKER_03]: putting some of those practices back into
play or refocusing or emphasizing them?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had a conversation a couple of
years ago with Steph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she told me that after all of the work
that ISA had done in states, when they
[SPEAKER_03]: went rec, they had to always go,
you always always had to go back into
[SPEAKER_03]: those same states to redo the work you had
done previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first draft of the regs in
California, I wrote a 44 page response
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing out to them the changes I thought
were necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes things are going to take a while
and you have to come up with a fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ACE is good at this, but a fix is not
a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In state law, I wrote and got past a piece
that allows patients to take their
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your rec, you go to the lab,
they'll test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine, that's great, but it's
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does give patients who are buying
in unlicensed stores an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure what they've got is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that kind of got to get it done
right now, got to protect the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of drives the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the great gifts is that when
somebody like Michael Bacchus shows up and
[SPEAKER_00]: really knows his stuff, the conversation
starts to point towards solutions rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than fixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 66 years old, I'm riddled with
arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't get this done soon,
I may not let this see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm particularly incentivized to
interact with the regulators at the state
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really pay attention to what's
going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the gift of one of the great
lobbyists in Sacramento, Don Duncan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and another organization I'm aligned with,
the Southern California Coalition has a
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbyist advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least people pay attention when
we're talking, people pay attention when
[SPEAKER_00]: we weigh in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are no longer referred to as drug
dealing tax chiefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only getting better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one thing that it's ironic that
we're talking about this, but when Dennis
[SPEAKER_06]: Perrone started the first Cannabis Buyers
Club, as he called it in California,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe the best solution to helping
patients is the return of the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: Buyers Club, where cannabis patients get
together, pool their money, and get legal
[SPEAKER_06]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically it is a not-for-profit,
but it's literally a buyer's club.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the power of patients coming together
to get the medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds a little- And they can then
afford their own testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but the great thing is testing has
gotten, I mean, testing is very
[SPEAKER_06]: competitive right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's interesting is all the labs,
good and bad, it's a very competitive
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the good news is the cost of good
testing is coming down, just like the cost
[SPEAKER_06]: of bad testing is coming down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what's great is that it's much more
viable now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, it really addresses what Alice
and Sarah are talking about in that it
[SPEAKER_06]: provides safe, affordable access,
which was the whole game, the whole reason
[SPEAKER_06]: this whole thing exists is because of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe it's time to go back to first
principles there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is a non-profit dispensary a shop allowed
in California now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, I thought that 64, when it did away
with collectives, that it mandated that
[SPEAKER_03]: shops had to be for-profit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has that been changed or- I think what
they were trying to do is change it from
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was to a viable industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my understanding is that you can still
form a small endeavor with four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that the longer we wait to
establish affordable, safe access,
[SPEAKER_00]: the harder it's going to become because as
the industry coalesces, people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: retail licenses, things like that,
aren't going to be too pleased about the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that somebody's coming in who can
undercut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really think about it as
being medicine that patients who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of money need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think of it as taking away from their
market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you have consolidation- and
you see this very clearly in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting how many places we
have now that have dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only in California, but Arizona,
all kinds of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has to be sort of a meeting of
the minds between the industry and those
[SPEAKER_00]: who are just not capable because they're
sick and they're poor of being much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the conversations I'd
like to start having sooner rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: later because it's hard enough right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until we see how many places in LA are
going to have true compassion programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of the lift they're going to be
able to do, it's kind of hard to go
[SPEAKER_00]: rushing in and go, okay, change everything
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have seen enough will, particularly
among veteran operators, to have
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful compassion programs that I
would sort of like to go down that road
[SPEAKER_00]: right now because truthfully, in this
time, in this place, it's the only road we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward, we have to see what COVID
does and we have to see what the will of
[SPEAKER_00]: the governor is and the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Michael says, you got to go in and
ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassion is not going to be on that
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, by the end of the year,
by this time next year, we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion programs all over Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if they don't cure the problem,
at least they'll address it to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature this year is not
addressing anything but COVID wildfires
[SPEAKER_00]: and homelessness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking specifically that people
pare down their legislative asks,
[SPEAKER_00]: their bills to accommodate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it means is that again and again,
I'm being told by people, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going forward with that cannabis
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in a tough spot, but if we keep
going forward together, we will get
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think also in the interim,
I think we should hack the system because
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as Alice noted, I mean,
she's found value products out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's found products that, you know,
and I don't want to put words in your
[SPEAKER_06]: mouth, but you know, when you talk about
companies like Raw Garden, which I have
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing to do with except for admiring the
fact that they could bring a reasonably
[SPEAKER_06]: priced high potency product to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like we need to like,
you know, find those and publicize those
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's what is needed right now
until other things can be put into play
[SPEAKER_06]: later this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you on that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I publicize them all the time on
my website, but you know, Sarah,
[SPEAKER_02]: who would I ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would I bug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the local level, when you go into
a dispensary or you look up their menu on
[SPEAKER_00]: weed maps, a truly good dispensary has
what the call bottom shelf, which is their
[SPEAKER_00]: less expensive strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have much bag appeal,
but a really skilled buyer knows how to
[SPEAKER_00]: find those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornerstone had them.
[SPEAKER_00]: LAPCG still has them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have some affordably priced
cannabis, ask them for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the state level, you have to find,
and this is true at the city level,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, you have to find your champions,
people who will commit to being the author
[SPEAKER_00]: with you being the sponsor of a bill that
will move things forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to try and do things at the local
level first because locally I only have to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince eight people to do what I want
them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The California legislature, you've got to
convince a lot more people and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those people aren't too enthusiastic about
cannabis to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't watch them closely,
they can do some very hurtful things while
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say never, ever approach an
elected official with your complaint
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you have the solution in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got to be a workable solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that, you're halfway to
three quarters way home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the legislative
calendars, you'll see again and again and
[SPEAKER_00]: again Bill Cork is putting forward bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called the Sexy Five
that Joan Sawyer talks about a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: because those were the legislators who
worked on first the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation and then later on
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys, they will take a meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Levine passed a bill that put forward a
bill that ACE also wrote, Don Duncan
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote, they got it passed, which stops
transplant patients from being thrown off
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant lists, which is a death
sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly organ failure is just a
horrible way to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for those guys who have been our
champions in the past and ask them for
[SPEAKER_00]: what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps if you can write the bill
yourself and if you can gather some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of grassroots support, like for instance,
for patients, it would be ACEA,
[SPEAKER_00]: the veterans groups that try and get
affordable cannabis or free cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kind of people, they get a lot of
respect at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a big labor union behind you like
the UFCW 770 here in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're halfway home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really pay attention to organizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Teamsters, my dad is a
Teamster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, love the Teamsters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, could you explain to us exactly
what SB 34 does, what it allows
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries to do in detail?
[SPEAKER_00]: That required a lot of legislation over
several years because they didn't figure
[SPEAKER_00]: in the big, big thing that was stopping
compassion, which was the taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's $9.60 an ounce or 65 cents an
ounce, some ridiculous amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got your excise tax,
your sales tax, your local taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all had to be done away with because
as long as that existed, it was just too
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive to try and get free cannabis to
people who really needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first they had one piece of legislation
that sort of allowed compassion programs
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they came back and I believe it
was SB 34 that got rid of the taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it seems weird that that was the
big sort of stone in the road for
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion, but it really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the most heartbreaking
testimony I ever heard at public comment
[SPEAKER_00]: was people who had been running these big
compassion programs for veterans and other
[SPEAKER_00]: people who just couldn't do it anymore
because it's taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, it brought tears to
my eyes and I don't cry easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited that the taxes have
gone away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael, you're known for crying for
fairly frequently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just give us a quick timeline of,
we talked the other day and you gave me
[SPEAKER_05]: the first shops in the Bay Area and then
the first ones in LA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then can you and Sarah give kind of,
I assume politicians weren't always
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you give some of the salacious
stories of dealing with the political
[SPEAKER_05]: bureaucracy in LA and Eagle Rock and... I
got a few of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the best one was the first time I had
two council members come to Cornerstone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither of them had ever stepped foot in a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was... And what year was this?
[SPEAKER_06]: This would have been 2008 maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Dennis Zine who was the former cop
that Sarah spoke about who became a
[SPEAKER_06]: champion of medical cannabis access in
California, in LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jose Huizar, who was my council member
in the district that my dispensary was in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was he also a champion of medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a champ.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it's hard to talk about Jose.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got quite a few nicknames around city
hall and he has an active FBI
[SPEAKER_06]: investigation right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he did tell me a funny story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to his office on Colorado Boulevard
in Eagle Rock and he told me about how he
[SPEAKER_06]: used to grow pot in his dad's front yard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he really likes to ingratiate
himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what was great about having them come
to my shop was... Cornerstone was really
[SPEAKER_06]: designed to look like a dentist's office.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really sterile.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our waiting room just looked like you
are kind of in a reasonably tasteful
[SPEAKER_06]: dentist's office.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much so that we had an OG Cush grower
driving down the street in his new sports
[SPEAKER_06]: car and run... He wasn't on our way to us,
but he's just blasting down the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he nicked a SUV trying to make a left
turn and they plowed through the window of
[SPEAKER_06]: our sales room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were so low key that when Fox News
showed up to cover it, they said we were a
[SPEAKER_06]: dentist's office.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't know we were a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in those days, the whole game was to
try to be as discreet as possible because
[SPEAKER_06]: you really wanted to try to avoid notice
of the DEA or LAPD.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it was... Those were really
interesting times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was really... I think there were
several council members who were very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very genuine in their support.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis Zine being one of them,
Paul Koretz being one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there were other people in the
Ellis City Council who were opponents and
[SPEAKER_06]: really tried to fight against it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Weezer actually started out being kind
of a supporter and then ended up being
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of an opponent and just flipping and
flopping away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so yeah, it's always been interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dealing with politicians, I mean,
Sarah's much more experienced than I am,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it hasn't made me love them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a source of great satisfaction to me
that Englander who has already pleaded
[SPEAKER_00]: guilty and Weezer who was on his way to
pleading guilty were historically two of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest opponents to safe access in
Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're exposed as people who have
done some very bad things far worse than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything I've known a pre-ICO to ever do
in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to pick your battles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get along with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people who have another
agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all across the state, you've seen
whistleblowing going on with local
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians who are demanding bribes,
doing different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most often, the reason the FBI guy
gets involved is a guy who's trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a license goes and says, you know,
I've been approached about this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the way it's supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that the cannabis industry
has a lot of problems to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think people who want to be
licensed, who want to follow the rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: should not be treated any differently than
any other business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of the big sticking points
because it's marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules are always going to be a little
different for you than everybody else who
[SPEAKER_00]: runs a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hopeful that as the years go by,
a cannabis dispensary will be treated just
[SPEAKER_00]: like any other retail operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the sticking point there is trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the thing is, there's a reason
that people want to sniff the jar when
[SPEAKER_06]: they come into shops is they don't trust
what they're being sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're often sold things by people who
don't know what they're selling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that as the cannabis
industry earns trust, I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: things are going to be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're still not there yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in the case of cannabis to some
degree, a lot of us still act like
[SPEAKER_06]: moonshiners who are trying to go legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, you see these famous
cultivators around California who used to
[SPEAKER_06]: be gangsters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the truth is just because they've got
a fancy shop on Melrose doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_06]: they're still not gangsters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there are some reasons to be
concerned.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think we still have to clean up
our act a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think at least the guy that,
you know, one of the main dispensers I
[SPEAKER_02]: used to go to before, you know,
COVID happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they figured out delivery
yet for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could see that they're enjoying
that lifestyle, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like you could see from the cars
they drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, OK, well, why are you about
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, again, it's, you know,
moonshiners used to sell out of the back
[SPEAKER_06]: of trucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the old days, everybody sold out from
the farm gate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we still have to get used
to the changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean we should cut out the
people who traditionally were involved in
[SPEAKER_06]: this business, but we should hold
everybody to a higher standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just quickly, Michael, I mean,
we talked about kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 years ago, it was people whose hearts
were in it, who were opening these shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's kind of been a changing of the
guard to people who are maybe a little
[SPEAKER_05]: more about money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give some love to some of the
people who were around when you ran
[SPEAKER_05]: Cornerstone, who you thought were kind of
truly champions of providing medicine to
[SPEAKER_05]: patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, you know, we already
mentioned Wham.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, Mike and Valerie Corral were
kind of the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I used to say that, you know,
Valerie Corral was the mother Teresa of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any room she walked into, she tried to
make every single person in the room feel
[SPEAKER_06]: comfortable and do anything she could to
make sure their needs were met.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, she was really, she is really
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Corral was just a brilliant
cultivator who just really paid attention
[SPEAKER_06]: to what kinds of cannabis might meet
people's medicinal needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he's a real hand full,
but I got to give a shout out to Steve D
[SPEAKER_06]: 'Angelo, because the truth is,
is that he's, I mean, the truth is,
[SPEAKER_06]: he really did take a lot of arrows for
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a meeting with George Lucas one
time, you know, Lucas said, first one up
[SPEAKER_06]: the hill, it catches all the arrows.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, man, D'Angelo took a lot of arrows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's a colorful guy with a
colorful past, but we wouldn't have lab
[SPEAKER_06]: testing in California without him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he really, and then that's a huge,
huge thing because patients have to know
[SPEAKER_06]: what's in their medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, Asa, I mean,
Asa really carried the water for this
[SPEAKER_06]: whole concept of access.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were really effective because the
combination of Steph Sherer and Don
[SPEAKER_06]: Duncan, there were, and Sarah Armstrong,
they're just relentless.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Yami Bolanos here in town with Glacca
also just relentless.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what it takes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just takes people who are not going to
take no for an answer, who know that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're on the right side of history.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are all kinds of people in
the Emerald Triangle who were looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis varieties that had things like
CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And still, you know, when the DEA showed
up, the DEA didn't care that it had CBD in
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they were taking great personal
risks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also we're growing a plant that wasn't
commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people had no idea what CBD was,
so they wouldn't pay for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was really from the heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think the pioneers, I mean,
you really got to read Martin Lee's book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Martin Lee and Fred Garner for
Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Martin Lee had written a book called
Smoke Signals, which is a social history
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis in the United States and
really worth reading because it really
[SPEAKER_06]: tells the story of a lot of these early
fights like with Todd Micaria,
[SPEAKER_06]: who was this doctor who like just before
anybody was like talking about the
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal uses of cannabis for dozens of
conditions and he's been proved right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, a project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and then so Fred Garner also started
O'Shaughnessy's, which was this amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: newspaper that collected all the latest
scientific data about the medicinal uses
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he interviewed Ethan Russo and Rafi
Mishulam and all these pioneering cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_06]: And O'Shaughnessy's to this day is still
has been, you know, a fantastic resource
[SPEAKER_06]: for people trying to use cannabis as a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just my two cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had taken notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to remember everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always talk to me, Alice,
anytime you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can watch the video again later.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also just friend me wherever and ask
me any questions you want, anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to interview you for my site.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got a question while we have Michael.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at an article now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was posted today on Fresh Toast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can marijuana terpenes treat COVID?
[SPEAKER_03]: These scientists believe so.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're referencing the Israeli research.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two or three different studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this is Dini Mayri in Israel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dini Mayri has been, he was holding
his results really close to his chest for
[SPEAKER_06]: a long time because I think he was trying
to raise venture capital.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he'd done tests on cannabis compounds
and cancer lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are cell studies, typically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happens is they'll take a pure
compound, a pure terpene, a pure
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid, yada, yada, and they'll put
it on a culture plate of a cancer cell or
[SPEAKER_06]: another kind of cell and then watch to see
how it interacts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are all these assays out there
that allow you to do testing on a cell
[SPEAKER_06]: level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that's called in vitro testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a limited use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what it may be is they're watching how
these pure compounds interact with this
[SPEAKER_06]: particular type of coronavirus and whether
or not it can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it likely it can?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how likely it is at the dose that
people are normally exposed to or can
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerate?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another question.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are bigger concerns about
cannabis and COVID right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest concern comes out of an
unrelated study from University of
[SPEAKER_06]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was published a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's they looked at is they looked
at blood clotting in trauma victims whose
[SPEAKER_06]: blood tested positive for THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were finding increased blood
clotting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a real problem with COVID because
COVID appears to derange blood clotting in
[SPEAKER_06]: younger patients infected with COVID and
can lead to strokes and heart attacks and
[SPEAKER_06]: all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, how does THC play in
the COVID world?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the initial evidence is a little
concerning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I've been telling people is
regardless of the terpene, regardless of
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabinoid you use, take the minimum
effective dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a time to try to beat your
personal dabbing record.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it could have really, really bad
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, I mean, in the case of the
trauma thing, I mean, that's a bit of a
[SPEAKER_06]: stretch to say, oh, COVID clotting,
trauma clotting, but it's the same cascade
[SPEAKER_06]: within the body.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there forms of ingestion that you feel
are probably safer than others at this
[SPEAKER_03]: time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was also a study that was
discussed last week on the American
[SPEAKER_06]: Chemical Society CAN meeting about
breakdown products from terpenes in
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporizers, e-pens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the results are ugly.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: The higher the temperature, the higher the
voltage on the pen, the more these
[SPEAKER_06]: breakdown products are created.
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, the breakdown products are the
principle dangerous components in most air
[SPEAKER_06]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there are a lot of terpenes in
nature, and when they break down in
[SPEAKER_06]: certain conditions, they can interact with
things and form ozone and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: nasty things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing that's the takeaway is that
you want to use the lowest temperature
[SPEAKER_06]: ingestion system if you're going to
inhale.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people just get better effects
from inhalation because it's a different
[SPEAKER_06]: pathway, effectively, different metabolic
pathway.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my advice is move towards flower
vaporizers whenever possible or low
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using electronic vaporizers,
use the lowest vaporization setting,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is typically 3.2 volts, and don't
crank the temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the problem with vaping is vaping is
effectively like smoking in ultra slow
[SPEAKER_06]: motion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get the turps off first and then
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most people don't like vaporizers
because it feels different.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just not being patient enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're patient with a vaporizer,
you will get exactly the same effect you
[SPEAKER_06]: get from smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to be spread out a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people need to understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to clarify, are you talking like a
dryer vaporizer or like a vape pen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my favorite, my favorites, I've got
them nearby because I use them.
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorites are the Mighty from stores in
Bickel, like right here, and the latest
[SPEAKER_06]: Firefly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on what you want to use because
this is confection.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, really like the Mighty.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just because it's got the temperature
on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can set it to 392.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw that one for the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom, remember when all the hash makers
stopped by and one of them pulled that
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, this one's actually in my car,
so I don't have it with me, but I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: playing with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been getting back into dryer
vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you get high turp cannabis,
they're really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, I've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question for you then.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Michael.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he has to take a call.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just muted him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically is what he's saying that too
much THC is not good at this point?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what you have to do is you have to
control your THC dose if you've been
[SPEAKER_06]: exposed to COVID, because we don't know if
it could potentially, if you start to
[SPEAKER_06]: develop clotting issues related to COVID
infection, THC may exacerbate those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not going to know because
there's not going to be studies done for a
[SPEAKER_06]: little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, we're just dealing with COVID
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But soon what will happen is
epidemiologists will look at the blood
[SPEAKER_06]: samples of COVID patients that come in and
they'll screen them for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they'll start to look for
patterns to say, oh, people who had high
[SPEAKER_06]: amounts of THC metabolites had worse
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know that yet, but don't be
surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're launching some new products now
in the middle of all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do that taking into account
everything that you've just said?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I basically designed
vaporizable products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, where a flower product where what
I've done is I've stabilized the terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way I use the products isn't a
flower vape.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just love them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, all I was trying to do with
my new company was literally invent a
[SPEAKER_06]: product that I liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a jar of it on the table in
front of you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get a visual?
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you pull some flower out?
[SPEAKER_06]: I emptied this one already.
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_06]: I use my own product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fresh out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where and when can those be found?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're launching this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you go to Perfect Dash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect-blends.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look who's back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I've got to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be back in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to drop some samples in front of my
house.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, John, I think this could be for you
and Sarah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah, we had talked about kind of
barriers to safe access and we talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about economic and then obviously local
control, which means that there are
[SPEAKER_05]: deserts, the no compassion programs or
samples, which is now kind of hopefully
[SPEAKER_05]: changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It went way in one direction of nothing
and now it's hopefully coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But can you talk about barriers to safe
access going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to be truly accessible,
it's got to become a lot cheaper and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very complex discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I'd like to see is
the last time I saw Gene talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: he talked about, and this was several
years ago, he talked about how there had
[SPEAKER_00]: been no trials on humans for how cannabis
might help with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think getting the research done,
people like Michael Backus and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will lead you to a more cost-effective
and viable product, but we can't stop with
[SPEAKER_00]: the research either.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been thousands of studies done
and it just amazes me that we still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third problem is that from a political
point of view, many, many, many
[SPEAKER_00]: legislators at all levels, federal,
state, local, are still convinced that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is not medicine and even though
their electorate has frequently voted to
[SPEAKER_00]: have safe access, they find a number of
ways to impede that progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your economics, you need
more research, and you need to really get
[SPEAKER_00]: in the face of legislators and talk to
them in such a way that they can no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: stall on bringing safe access to every
community that voted first in 1996 for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and then again for adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll let Gene tell you the rest of it
because I know he's got some thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of, well, my question is,
and I already know the answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the Compassionate Use Act,
Prop 215, still is in effect as far as I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you can comment on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because, you know, the
patients, to me, are the ultimate
[SPEAKER_01]: warriors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And outside of the patients are folks like
Dennis Perrone and Todd Micaria who
[SPEAKER_01]: created this act, you know, with the
intention of compassion for the patient's
[SPEAKER_01]: plight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that act, they allowed folks to get
access.
[SPEAKER_01]: To their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to step away just now to talk to
a patient who reminded me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's able to grow her own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, she gets this reaction from
certain types.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Cush varietals, she calls,
quote unquote, where she gets an infection
[SPEAKER_01]: or an inflammation in her sinuses,
but she needs the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she's got to figure out which
medicine will not give her the negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and which will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's able to do that because she
lives in the Santa Cruz mountains and
[SPEAKER_01]: around her are many people who grow and
she feels confident in their source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she's in the lucky position.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many patients, especially in the LA
area, are relying on labeling and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, don't live next to a cultivator
that can reliably give them medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm excited about is and what I
believe is that the Compassionate Use Act
[SPEAKER_01]: still is in effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you can help me with affirming
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest problem is that, yes,
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get a medical license.
[SPEAKER_00]: But patients over the years have suffered
from such invasive discrimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when legalization hit, they stopped
renewing their recs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to tell you of all the things
that patients do, that makes me the most
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because frequently the only person you're
going to talk to who can really tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: what's what.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're very sick, you may be taking 10
different kinds of pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to work with a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when patients stopped renewing their
recs, there was a very firm network across
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene, one of Gene's doctors in his network
actually saved my life at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were dedicated doctors who really
knew their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, patients aren't
renewing their recs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not getting that input from a
medical doctor anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients make up, from what dispensary
operators tell me, between 70% and 85% of
[SPEAKER_00]: their clientele still.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not renewing their recs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of it, back in the day before
legalization passed, if you wanted to work
[SPEAKER_00]: in a dispenser, you had to have a rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the workforce is still very much
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my point of view, once you stop
having experts in the mix, and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: people trying to sell you products,
you can get into some very dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still renew my rec every year,
and I still get my county card through the
[SPEAKER_00]: state program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to be able to sit down and
talk to a doctor and ask the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that no budtender is ever going
to be able to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way that compassionate use
has kind of gone south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very dangerous development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem with this is that
patients are no longer identifiable as a
[SPEAKER_00]: discrete group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now lumped in with recreational
users.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally feel that all use is medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Perrone is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never had a lengthy conversation
with a recreational user who didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly own up to the fact that marijuana
was wonderful because it took care of
[SPEAKER_00]: things like sleeplessness or anxiety or
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are medical uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not have a glass of wine and relax
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is treating some pretty core
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compassionate use still exists at the
state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you check one box for medical and
one box for recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would advise everybody to always get a
medical license if you're going to operate
[SPEAKER_00]: a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ASA got the CGS Amendment in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been renewed every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the federal government
cannot raid you or bother you if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: obeying the laws of your home state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, more than any other development,
that ending of the raids, the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: raids, helped the industry in Los Angeles
and all across the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassionate use is widely misunderstood
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost become like this thing your
grandparents did back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe it's very much alive and
that we have a long way to go before
[SPEAKER_00]: patients have true access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just hope that I'm well enough to
continue to fight until I can't anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that when I lay down my burden,
that I can look out on a landscape where I
[SPEAKER_00]: will never be denied safe access again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great answer, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a dog cameo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted a message to all of you about the
University of Arizona study that led to my
[SPEAKER_06]: concern about COVID in certain patients
and THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, you should check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good study.
[SPEAKER_06]: These people know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason I really love having
doctors in charge of this is, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: like Michael Backus too, is there's this,
I don't know what to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That marijuana is the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cure everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take care of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my experience has been quite often it
does, but when it doesn't, it can really
[SPEAKER_00]: have some bad effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having educated people talking in a
science-based language about this can only
[SPEAKER_00]: be good, even if it means sometimes you
have to say, there may be a problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think, I mean, and that's why
it's got to be doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not never going to be me.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I do is point at doctors and translate
for patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So typically most people who get a medical
recommendation, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have enough interaction with their
doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not necessarily because the doctor
doesn't want it, but it's just the patient
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't take advantage of the access.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I like to point at doctors and say,
ask them because they're doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with being a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you guys, but I do have to
say, you know, I get my information from
[SPEAKER_01]: patients a lot and it's a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate everyone for contributing to
the community and we're going to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out how this is going to help more people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just quickly on a fun note,
the inspiration for pulling this whole
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation together was a coronavirus
beginning of lockdown story that crossed
[SPEAKER_05]: my radar, which was Alice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Alice, can you talk, I guess the shop
you normally went to wasn't delivering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you tell the story and give
everyone the backstory?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Pure Life is a, Pure Life is a great
shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Sarah had talked about,
you know, you know, you find a good
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary when they have the lower level,
you know, it's not lower level,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still high quality, but they sell it
for maybe 20 bucks an eighth or possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just weren't working out the
whole delivery service.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for my wife and I,
you know, cannabis is ultimately,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm on, like Sarah said,
I'm on six to seven different medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not on any pain medications and
that's largely due to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as my wife, there's no medications
for the multitude of symptoms that she,
[SPEAKER_02]: that she goes through every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is it basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so our main dispensary that we
go to, which is not 10 minutes away from
[SPEAKER_02]: my house, you know, wasn't doing the
delivery services.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, one of my favorite brands that they
were selling was this brand called
[SPEAKER_02]: CaliHash and they do cold water
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another, another source that,
you know, is pure and doesn't have any,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sort of reached out to him, you know,
through my network, Rolling Stone,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I also have an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I got to know many of these
med makers was I would get their medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would tag them in my daily posts,
you know, and Michael has always been very
[SPEAKER_02]: supportive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Dominique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I reached out to him and I said,
Hey, is there any chance I could get any
[SPEAKER_02]: of your hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not issuing delivery at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came straight to me the next day
and just said, you know, here,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I was, I was thrilled by
that and touched by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also introduced me to, to one of
his hash makers who also that I had never
[SPEAKER_02]: met this, this young man before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's also sort of supplying me with,
with medicine as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I kind of, for the first time
inadvertently have my own compassionate
[SPEAKER_02]: care set up, you know, because of,
because of COVID interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Extractors make great friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the thing about it is,
is that what I've noticed about,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's funny because for years I was
much more on the flower side of things
[SPEAKER_06]: than the extract side of things,
but that's changed in the last two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've learned a lot more about
extraction and been involved in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it's, for me, it's,
it's flower and hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that seems to be my bread and
butter because with flour, it flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say takes away the pain,
but it doesn't take away the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes away the spasticity, but you put
the two together and it's like the best
[SPEAKER_02]: THC sandwich you could ever hope to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I mean, I think honestly that I'm
really fascinated by the combination of
[SPEAKER_06]: flower and extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I, what I call infused flower and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's again, in a vaporizer,
it's just the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get back on that train because
for the longest time, that's what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it, it, no,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a slow creep, but it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael, what, what peaks your interest
with extracts going forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see more opportunities with them?
[SPEAKER_05]: And distinguish between solvent and
solvent list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you exploring both?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mechanical extraction, that's things
like water hash, rosin technology,
[SPEAKER_06]: where you actually squeeze the cannabis
and, and effectively you're getting maple
[SPEAKER_06]: syrup out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The truth is I'm kind of agnostic about,
about methods right now, because I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: noticing chemical differences that are of
utility and solvent based extracts that I
[SPEAKER_06]: expected to see in solvent lists based
extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So solvent extracts take a lot more off
the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or that can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm finding it in my particular use case
to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm very, I'm very agnostic when it
comes to technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that it tests
really clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just give an example of something
that it has that you like or are looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what, what I find is I get higher TURP
fractions when I use solvents to extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's great is, is that I'm
incredibly patient with my solvent
[SPEAKER_06]: extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, I extract them in insane,
insanely low temperatures, like 120 minus
[SPEAKER_06]: 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what I do is I very, very
carefully remove, purge the solvent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I end up with is I end up with a,
with a sauce product that then I nucleate
[SPEAKER_06]: the THCA out of.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I end up with THCA crystals and high
terpene extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me, then I can start to play with
cannabinoid ratios and terpene ratios in a
[SPEAKER_06]: very, very rich manner.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I use mechanical extraction,
like taking water hash and then pressing
[SPEAKER_06]: rosin from it, I'll get an insanely high
quality product, but it doesn't have quite
[SPEAKER_06]: the range of chemistry that I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my friends at 710 lab make
basically the best solventless extract in
[SPEAKER_06]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not affordable.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not affordable because it,
it, they're, they're maniacs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do everything by hand and,
and, and they, they, they hand,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's no automation basically in
their facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So their costs are just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and they could do a lot of
efficiencies, but they want to do it their
[SPEAKER_06]: way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why companies like Rock Garden
can provide you with a much less expensive
[SPEAKER_06]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less clean, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything has to be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because everything has to be
tested if it's going through the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: My assurance that, you know, metals and
pesticide residues and solvents are not
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be there are pretty high because
I can look at the COA.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and also, I mean, there are certain
labs, if I see their COA and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: suspicious about one of their results,
I'll just send it through a lab I trust to
[SPEAKER_06]: see if I'm, if they're accurate or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason they aren't is they're in a
rush.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of these labs pump stuff through and
that can end up with sloppy chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just quickly, what's your solvent of
choice when you keep mentioning solvent?
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I, I'm kind of agnostic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've had like, I used to test
butane until I read that the federal
[SPEAKER_06]: inhalation standards for butane are 40% of
what you're inhaling for 11 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's considered completely safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So concerns about butane residues,
they're right now for me, nonexistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I used, what I, what I was actually
really scared of back in the day is that
[SPEAKER_06]: they used odorants in butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could smell it if it was leaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those odorants typically are
mercaptans and they're really dangerous,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if you heat them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, so the old open blasting days of
butane extracts, that's the reason I never
[SPEAKER_05]: carried that with PVC pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what scares you now?
[SPEAKER_06]: The scariest thing, let's see what scares
me now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that really scares me now
is a bad laugh.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, a laugh.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I've kind of, I really like,
I check out my labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I check out my personal physicians.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know that they're really into
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really like what they're doing and
really want to learn more about what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the great thing is like,
personally, I use SC labs a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked with them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've watched the quality of their
chemistry go up and up and up while the,
[SPEAKER_06]: their throughput goes down and down and
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the longest terpene method in
California right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their runs are like 60 minutes for terps,
which means the peaks in the result are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, so yeah, what concerns me now is
just that a lab's going to fool me and
[SPEAKER_06]: that the state does not have enough
oversight over the labs to catch the bad
[SPEAKER_06]: apples yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm hoping that will come,
but it really does need to come because
[SPEAKER_06]: certain things like, I don't want somebody
to cut corner on after toxin testing
[SPEAKER_06]: because aflatoxins can cause liver cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I don't want somebody to get
aspergillus infested weed that's putting
[SPEAKER_06]: out these toxins and ingest it and then
have liver problems because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, is it just a thing to ask your
dispensary, you know, where do they get
[SPEAKER_02]: their testing from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just ask for their COAs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to have them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to have them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, and you're going to get the
blank look from most staff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just be very, very, very nice and very,
very insistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say, I've got this rare condition and I've
got a great attorney.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to see this COA because if
something happens to me, it's really out
[SPEAKER_06]: of my hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: My attorney and his law firm, Engulf and
Devour, just has a reputation for,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, owning businesses that mess with
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's two o'clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess last words, Michael had said we
were talking concerns from the doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: What concerns you and one or two final
thoughts looking forward 2020 and beyond?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, pushing the idea that,
you know, moving cannabis from where it is
[SPEAKER_01]: now to really making it medicine and
pushing our studies forward is really my
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we can rely on the state
or the federal government to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a movement started by people,
patients, and patient groups like
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to get together and
contribute in a nonprofit way to improving
[SPEAKER_01]: the studies, improving the research on
these products so that patients are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the best medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And absolutely, I'm completely concerned
that this medicine is not subsidized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to many patients all the time and
do not have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state, the federal government can't
think about cannabis as a way to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: funds by taxing patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the right way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a compassionate society that we're
worried about COVID, we're worried about
[SPEAKER_01]: each other being exposed to this virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to also worry about draining money
from our suffering population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane to think about it,
to think about it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so financially and rigorous science to
improve the medicine, definitely those are
[SPEAKER_01]: my two biggest thoughts these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, policy expert, what are your final
thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds kind of basic,
but looking back on it, we only got to
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, if somebody was born in
1953 and really knows what prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like, I never dreamed we'd get this
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you can do what you can do,
help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody expects somebody who is poor and
sick to make the same kind of effort that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's wealthy and well can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when that plea comes across your
Facebook page and they want you to click
[SPEAKER_00]: on a link and fill out a few fields so a
letter goes to your representative,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you may think that's a small
thing, but those small things,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, they add up to something big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we have to do is keep marching
forward now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have turned the corner, believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, I have a last quick question for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insurance companies, I thought a few years
ago that they were starting to step up and
[SPEAKER_03]: they were gonna cover cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we put pressure on them?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we do to move that forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what their links to the
federal government are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may well be the sticking point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have longed to be able to deduct my
cannabis expenses either off my state
[SPEAKER_00]: income tax or get reimbursed by insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get a real feeling that when it
comes to your health insurance that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's meaningful ties to the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until we can sort of untie that
Gordian knot, the health providers are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be reluctant, the different
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another good battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me, it's really, really a
worthwhile effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that we can prove that
cannabis saves them money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as expensive as a lot of the
pharmaceuticals out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's what's motivating them,
then I think it's a good way to convince
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance companies to support that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and the final word will go to Alice,
our patient and the next generation of
[SPEAKER_05]: advocates who will carry the baton.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, geez, I'm gonna end it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to, I hope that we continue
talking after all this because right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's all I have is a network of
patients, which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can do that all day long,
but I hope that we all stay in contact and
[SPEAKER_02]: we can all make some change together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think disability is nothing to be
ashamed of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what it boils down to
as well, is that most of our government,
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel it maybe doesn't have use
for people with disabilities or illnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that is total top wash because
you look at where we're at now,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to, sorry, my dogs are sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to staying at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the vast majority of people are
getting sick and they're not used to being
[SPEAKER_02]: at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're the ones that are gonna be the
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: People with disabilities are the true
Buddhas of the world, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and on that, it's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for participating and we'll
continue these types of conversations
[SPEAKER_05]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: So have a good rest of your Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.
Have
[SPEAKER_04]: a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.
