[SPEAKER_03]: On-site consumption, cannabis events,
and cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start off discussing
on-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Amanda's going to give us kind of like
an overview of the different approaches in
[SPEAKER_03]: different jurisdictions across California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also first want to start by
explaining in California, there's on-site
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption and there's events.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about on-site
consumption and then there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: variations of on-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got places that are dispensaries
that have a consumption venue attached
[SPEAKER_00]: there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's such a thing that's
separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are standalone lounges that are
places just to go consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the two different concepts
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So San Francisco is one of the earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What San Francisco has is three
dispensaries that have on-site consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: lounges attached to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these were in existence well before
all the state regulations came into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And San Francisco wanted to do more work
and look at this more carefully down the
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they decided to grandfather in those
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the only three in San
Francisco today that are allowed to have
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, San Francisco is looking at a
much more robust set of regulations for
[SPEAKER_00]: that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very concerned about clean air
and worker protection in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to expect some probably
really robust regulation there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're probably going to set the
stage for many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in Coachella, Cathedral City and Palm
Springs, they also are on-site
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a pretty recent developments
in those places down in the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: West Hollywood is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have both.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at lounges and they're
looking at places that have on-site
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption and they're different
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting because it's a
combo play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing about West Hollywood is
they've always kind of looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves as adult Disneyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, bring it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want condom billboards?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want strip clubs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're open to everything down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, this fits West
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adult Disneyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've been very aggressive about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still working on actually
issuing permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they haven't issued any of these
on-site consumptions or separate lounge
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to pass the mic to these two
ladies if they want to add some insight
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think they've both worked on
applications in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the interesting part for me about
West Hollywood is they are more willing as
[SPEAKER_02]: a city, I think, to push the envelope
versus what the state will allow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also look specifically at edible
consumption and the desire to have
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurants and ready-made food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the idea of smoking and having the
ability to do so at a consumption lounge,
[SPEAKER_02]: that ties into OSHA and how, if you're not
a manager, can you be in a facility and
[SPEAKER_02]: exposed to smoke and your workers exposed
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: How that consumption lounge, they,
I think at one point, West Hollywood was
[SPEAKER_02]: discussing saying, open until 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: for a consumption lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that going to do to the dynamics
and how do you have to be a good actor
[SPEAKER_02]: within that facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to see West Hollywood
continue to push the envelope,
[SPEAKER_02]: work with the state to fold in where they
need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite comment during the WeHo
process was when they said, we have no
[SPEAKER_02]: children.
[SPEAKER_02]: When discussing setbacks, the city manager
was like, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have children.
[SPEAKER_02]: My godson goes to school in West
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that gives you any indication about
where that city is, those are cities that
[SPEAKER_02]: I think are going to come on with events,
as we'll talk about later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were to ask me a crystal ball
question, I don't think they're the first
[SPEAKER_02]: one that's going to do an event outside of
their existing would-be allowance for
[SPEAKER_02]: on-site consumption and retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things Pam was just
talking about was OSHA, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard her talk about OSHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concerns that San Francisco raised and
the reason why they're getting robust are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the same things that were raised
in a recent report from Cal OSHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cal OSHA was first tasked with looking
at whether or not they needed to create
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations specific for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they created a work group
internally on this and they put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: report, I believe September, I don't know,
sometime in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this report did is it looked at a
lot of risks to workers in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked at things like people working in
cultivation facilities and protection from
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide exposure and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most everything they came up with,
they said, well, that already is covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm workers have rules that they need to
follow in general in any agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: those would apply and protect the workers
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the big things they got hung up
on was this on-site social consumption and
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to secondhand smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the same thing San Francisco
is worried about and that we're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to see more on Cal OSHA from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that come in with the clean
air laws, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely keep an eye on Cal OSHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Industrial Relations Board,
basically is what it's properly called.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we really go down the road of
telling you where things are evolving,
[SPEAKER_01]: how things work, what towns are starting
to see some progress in this direction,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just tell all of you in the
audience that you really have to just
[SPEAKER_01]: adopt this mindset that this is a starting
point and really the way you get things
[SPEAKER_01]: going is to start having conversations
with the people in the municipalities
[SPEAKER_01]: where you want to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a much better chance of
developing a program that really works in
[SPEAKER_01]: your real life situation than to sit back
and wait for them to come up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to the table with a business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know what you're thinking about
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know that you're
well-capitalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know about your ties to the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of those conversations that will
give them the comfort level to take the
[SPEAKER_01]: next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be many municipalities that
will wait for other cities to do it first
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll wait to see how things happen
before they do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can start having those
conversations now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's better to be armed with
information that helps educate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should not assume that they know as
much as you do about the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really taking on the responsibility
of educating the people that you meet
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing to add to that, too,
is Diane is so right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in our software, you can see every
city council meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be an informational item on
Prop 64 and I tell people those don't just
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because a stakeholder went to that
city and pushed them to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not the stakeholder that's
initiating that conversation, another one
[SPEAKER_00]: is and you're not a part of that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These conversations are all happening
because somebody is doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is rarely the city going, huh,
wait, I need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, if you're not, someone else
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's we at GreenWise like to call it a
solutions-driven approach, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have the conversation and know what that
city does in same or similar circumstances
[SPEAKER_02]: that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking about consumption,
if you're talking about an event,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have rhetoric already built in to
their zoning code, they have processes in
[SPEAKER_02]: place, permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you make it comfortable and
familiar, you're going to get more
[SPEAKER_02]: traction in that conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let this be a good steward of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a city is toying with the ideas to
whether or not they want to regulate,
[SPEAKER_02]: showing them an educational event that's
well organized, that they're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: an ROI on, that may push them into
regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really a way or a mechanism
that we've been gifted to be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: an honest communication with the local
jurisdictions where they can see the
[SPEAKER_02]: activity before they have to go and
develop an entire program for the supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This gives them a flavor of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully we can use it to spark
more regulation throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting a lot of questions about use
in homes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess a lot of questions from people
who want to think, what are the boundaries
[SPEAKER_03]: and parameters for sales and consumption
in private residences?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how is that different than what we're
talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you quickly go over that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can consume cannabis in your private
residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot sell to your friends unless you
are a licensed business and your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: are at your licensed business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can consume with your friends in your
own home.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in your backyard, you've got to
be a little careful sometimes because
[SPEAKER_00]: where is that in regard to what's public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you visible to your neighbors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you visible to the street?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a good neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably not going to come after
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I always like to asterisk that if
you're living in an apartment building,
[SPEAKER_02]: look at your lease and what you're allowed
to do or your commercial business and you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to throw an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still unfortunately a schedule one
federally illegal substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very commonplace to see in a lease
that you shouldn't be conducting
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial or you shouldn't be conducting
federally illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems logical, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't want your business being used
for a crack house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, we have a call out for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something when we work on cannabis
leases within the supply chain verticals
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have to address.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we need, as Diane will talk
about, more places for responsible
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're seeing in Colorado,
which is a little bit of a view into the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of this, I just attended an event a
few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that has been holding these
events, they are private events.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are held usually on farms that are
close to the more metropolitan area,
[SPEAKER_01]: but their people are fine with having
consumption on their private residences.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has gone methodically through every
step of the process to make sure that even
[SPEAKER_01]: the businesses that she's working with,
the dispensary, the brands that she's
[SPEAKER_01]: working with for these events,
are following all the regulations along
[SPEAKER_01]: the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Boulder, where I live,
Boulder has created another layer on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the state regulations that requires
that you can't sell product below what
[SPEAKER_01]: your wholesale price is.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has had to go through the effort of
putting together goodie bags with the
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that are sponsoring these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to work up a price structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to ensure that the total
quantity of the goodie bag items don't go
[SPEAKER_01]: over the state limits of what an
individual can purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are attending these events
actually have to go to the dispensary to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase the goodie bag, and then they
bring that goodie bag with them to the
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation to all of you is find
out all along the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're wanting to put on an event,
find out what the dispensaries are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to do to stay in compliance,
find out what the event's going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: do to remain in compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be little nuances that you
have to use when you're sending out your
[SPEAKER_01]: invitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have to be vetted for making
sure that the person's 21 or over.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these little details that add
on to what you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: research to make sure that what you're
doing covers all of the check boxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: that nothing gets left unchecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we have learned from experience,
complete compliance with the local
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations and local directives is
critical to make these events successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: California is so individualized.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 58 counties, 482 different cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're each going to have their own way
of regulating cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to start discussing
cannabis events, and I guess we'll start
[SPEAKER_03]: off with Assembly Bill 2020, which is a
major legislative development,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll pass it off to Pam, who's the
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: AB 2020 allows for events to not solely
take place on fairgrounds or district
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been an extremely limiting aspect
of cannabis event regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the DAAs, whereas you would think,
if you were limited to a county fairground
[SPEAKER_02]: or a district agricultural association,
that that state agency would have control
[SPEAKER_02]: over their borders, or what happens within
those jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had to go to the local jurisdiction
in which a DAA or a county fairground sat
[SPEAKER_02]: and get their approval.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't necessarily seem difficult,
but in the instances in Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: California, specifically, you had the 28th
DAA who wanted to throw the chalice event.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to go to the city of Victorville.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city of Victorville had banned all
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while you had a willing district
agricultural association, in that
[SPEAKER_02]: instance, you didn't have a willing
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with AB 2020, you opens up to other
venues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say a neighboring city of
Hisperia, who now currently has delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: allowances, wanted to throw an event,
they now could identify a location within
[SPEAKER_02]: that city.
[SPEAKER_02]: The event organizer could come in and ask
for local approval.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't need to be on the
fairground that is located over in
[SPEAKER_02]: Victorville.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it opens us up to being able to have
events, not at DAAs or county fairgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do local jurisdictions grapple
with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to have some amount
of a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is that going to look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see a significant uptick in
regulation in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we've discussed, if you go to them
in a solutions-driven way and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do I go about doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we work through it together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an existing temporary events
or an event structure that we can just add
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to as an additional element?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would go through and you can get
your state events licensee, and that shows
[SPEAKER_02]: that you've already committed,
that you're already understanding the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis process and will make that
conversation easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before you go to get your event license
or your temporary event allowance from the
[SPEAKER_02]: local authorization, get your events
organizer licensee to show credibility,
[SPEAKER_02]: proof of concept, that you understand the
cannabis rules and the discussion that you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess to elaborate on the process,
step number one is to get a cannabis event
[SPEAKER_03]: organizer license from the Bureau of
Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, they're handing out
temporary cannabis event organizer
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses until the permanent regs are
released.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're handing those out for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Step two is obtain local authorization,
express local approval from the local
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Step number three is get a temporary
cannabis event license for a temporary
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis event lasting up to four days at
that location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this allows for short-term events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four days is pretty generous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a three-day weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it really unlocks cannabis events
that we have seen so far six in the state
[SPEAKER_03]: of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all been at county fairgrounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we will start seeing cannabis events
all sorts of places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to hear from the
panelists, what kind of cannabis events do
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to see that you haven't seen
before?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like California has almost like a
blank canvas when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen like bacon and beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like cannabis and beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cannabis and bacon event sounds
kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Munchy Festival, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, some cool pairing events would
be pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to see an event where we showcase
responsible consumption and change that
[SPEAKER_02]: image where we're really interacting
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having an experience, being able to
understand what that's like and invite
[SPEAKER_02]: novice people in and do an event that's
really about microdosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Pam, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she's got my brain going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to do, I'm changing mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do an event for like baby
boomers where over a couple days they can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually try a bunch of different products
in a controlled environment where they
[SPEAKER_00]: felt safe and learn because a lot of
people go buy something and that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like over and they'll go
back to their pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to see a multi-day event
where every few hours they could try a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of this and that and figure out
what heals them and make it like really
[SPEAKER_00]: geriatric friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a cannabis wellness weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that us OGs could go to,
right, Amanda?
[SPEAKER_02]: Getaway, small getaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think something that's really
interesting is California is the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries' world economies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's its own giant ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're already comfortable with how
much tourism happens in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some data here.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23.6 million tourists come to wineries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just apply the same principles to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be great to be able to go out
to a farm and see the cannabis growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe follow them to the
manufacturing location where that's turned
[SPEAKER_01]: into other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get your goody bag when you
leave maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you even are able to sample some
cannabis while you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's going to be so many people
coming from other countries for the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places like China and South Korea where
they are not going to legalize anytime
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to come here to experience
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are so many great events that
are already being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like have you been to any of those
businesses that offer like you bring some
[SPEAKER_01]: wine and then you can paint a picture and
things like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff Paint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have that in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a friend of mine started her business
called Puff Pass and Paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have Puff Pass and Pamper
where they make bath salts that are
[SPEAKER_01]: infused and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those great ideas are coming here
to California as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a client waiting on a license in
West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've teamed up with a chef,
a 420 chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're working with labs to figure
out how can we have him demonstrate making
[SPEAKER_01]: some infused food products to his
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly go have that tested once it's
become infused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then get the test results back in time
for these people to actually consume on
[SPEAKER_01]: site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that be cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we'll see things like that evolving
as time goes on and as people take the
[SPEAKER_01]: leap to not only be the first,
but to kind of weather the storm and work
[SPEAKER_01]: out all the kinks of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming back with a resurgence of an
events culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really gonna be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is notorious and has a legacy for
creativity and innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited to see what's to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like a cannabis demo weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like putting everyone's ideas together and
see what that's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for what 2019 has to offer
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we already have a very thriving
ecosystem of cannabis events in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does this mean for all the pop-up
events that we're seeing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they gonna adapt?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is where you talk about track
and trace, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop-up events have been very concerning
specifically to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk again about in private
residences, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a vendor that's showcasing
there in California, how does that product
[SPEAKER_02]: get to that event?
[SPEAKER_02]: It cannot come from a manufacturer to your
private residence for them to give that
[SPEAKER_02]: product away and consume on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to go through the proper channels,
which here in California means it goes to
[SPEAKER_02]: a distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That distributor undertakes QA,
QC procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to a third party lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cleared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has cleared COA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes to a retailer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A retailer sells it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether or not that's an event license
that you can get to sell at that private
[SPEAKER_02]: residence, because you are not a
dispensary in your house, as Amanda said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these pop-up events that have been
occurring that are either on private
[SPEAKER_02]: property, and again, I always go back to
what's in the lease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you jeopardizing somebody's building
by doing so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I heard from the audience, what about
liquor licenses?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're having it at a restaurant and
you just did a pop-up event, what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: ABC going to say about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to not sell alcohol?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing a cannabis consumption
event, we've seen the governor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Omar, remind me of the bill number if you
have it off the top of your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign the bill that you can't have alcohol
and cannabis, which was then teed up in
[SPEAKER_02]: the draft permanent regulations that we
saw where you can't confuse a consumer and
[SPEAKER_02]: have de-alkalized beer or wine with
cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of concerns where those two
collide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't call it wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't call it wine or confuse the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's in a wine bottle, I think
there's going to make those arguments that
[SPEAKER_02]: it may not survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're still going to see what that
looks like and tread very cautiously any
[SPEAKER_02]: time you're going to have an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the plaguing legacy of pop-up
events is they are constantly combined
[SPEAKER_02]: with alcohol consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
the chief, Lori Ajax, is the former deputy
[SPEAKER_03]: chief of ABC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she has a very strong regulatory
enforcement background in alcohol
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems pretty clear that both
agencies want there to be a clear,
[SPEAKER_03]: bright line of division.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their concern, in my view, is the naive
consumer, people cross-fading who are not
[SPEAKER_03]: experienced in using both cannabis and
alcohol, they basically want to avoid the
[SPEAKER_03]: horror stories of somebody who gets
completely wasted because they're using
[SPEAKER_03]: both substances.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they find that's a way to mitigate the
public risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we go into some more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to get down to events in
California cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to get some of the very
latest updates on cannabis event
[SPEAKER_03]: ordinances from Amanda Ostrich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting is I actually made
some phone calls because I wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to some cities because there wasn't as
much as San Francisco was using our
[SPEAKER_00]: platform recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called me and they said,
hey, all I found was this, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I using the software wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just AB 2020 hadn't been signed yet and
people weren't dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there wasn't a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now Oakland is one who they just did a
cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was October 2nd they passed
this new ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did was it referenced their
pre-existing event laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said, here are our laws for
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what are going to be the laws
for events for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to limit you to 12 a year
because we don't want you using this
[SPEAKER_00]: events license as a workaround to actually
having a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want people to basically just
have a new event permit for each day,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next day, the next day and be playing
their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco is working on something more
robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect to see more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the last couple of weeks,
let's see, we saw Eureka just recently
[SPEAKER_00]: passed some ordinances around events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Humboldt County because I
thought, you know, that's a great place
[SPEAKER_00]: for events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically he said, our ordinance
basically just says, follow the state
[SPEAKER_00]: rules and get approval from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the exact process Omar
outlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some cities, I think we're going to see
a trend of a bunch that are just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, here are our regular event rules,
follow the state's cannabis event rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something is going to get messed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to do something stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the locals are going to start
making some more rules around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you guys act responsibly and don't
push them to where they have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll probably stick with less lenient
laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Joe who's sitting back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like this is something they're
going to take up next year in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, take a deeper look next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got enough on their plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But give it up for Joe being really
progressive and getting a lot of law done
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like making him blush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, can you elaborate a little bit on
Sacramento's unique event ordinance,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I think could be a model for the
rest of the state?
[SPEAKER_03]: It just delegates the authority to approve
events to the city managers, my
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, that was an administrative rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I think it was the goal to make
it so you don't have to have a hearing at
[SPEAKER_00]: a city council meeting every time,
much the way that if you were going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a normal permit for certain things in a
city, you go and you submit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person in the city manager's
office can approve or deny it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what they're doing is
making less city council hearing type of
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and delegating that authority to
make it smoother and simpler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think streamlining that approval
process can really allow more events to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to see more of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think initially, we're just going to
see people saying, hey, you have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your permit from a state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at their events laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is one where if you want
to influence your city to allow these
[SPEAKER_00]: events, go and look at their event laws as
they are and show them how to incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: that by reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not know how.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really simple work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hand them the draft that just
says, hey, you've got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's two or three things you want to
add that are specific to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's simple enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how Oakland did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how someone else did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them the cities that they generally
look to when making policy that have
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of how it's been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never want to be the first unless
you're one of the big renegades like
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland, West Hollywood, Sacramento,
San Francisco, who are set in the stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at the crystal ball,
Pam, where do you think in Southern
[SPEAKER_03]: California we will see these temporary
cannabis events not at a fairground or
[SPEAKER_03]: district agricultural association?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're going to be in more
unexpected places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say that come January,
you're going to see an event in Los
[SPEAKER_02]: Angeles, Santa Monica, or West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're more likely to see it
transpire potentially somewhere like
[SPEAKER_02]: Malibu or more likely in Coachella or Palm
Springs or Desert Hot Springs where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're used to doing events, where
they've already taken proactive steps
[SPEAKER_02]: towards consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not inundated like the city of
LA with processing the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you look outside of those,
you're going to see some interesting heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: hitters come in and set up the events
rhetoric here in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would encourage you to go,
like I said before, to smaller cities or
[SPEAKER_02]: even Long Beach and ask them to engage in
that conversation and provide,
[SPEAKER_02]: as Amanda said, that pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take the guesswork out of it and
you provide a potential avenue and
[SPEAKER_02]: solution, you can get to a point to throw
a well-conceived and please root it in
[SPEAKER_02]: education and compliance at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think you're going to start to
see those barriers come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like a snowball, we'll have more
robust events culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing to add what Pam is saying,
it's not just bring it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a lot of what I think
is going to be a successful approach are
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have an event and are looking
for a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to go to cities that
need money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to tell them this story
and say, look, you have all these hotels
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have an average vacancy rate of
what percentage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the economic stimulus we can bring
to your city over the course of a two-day
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are going to present what does it
look like on the number of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: eating in the restaurants, the hotels,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find a city that is looking for
revenue, they're going to hear this story
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, let's look at San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they enjoy doing outside
labor?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they make a ton of money for the
businesses and they stimulate the economy
[SPEAKER_00]: in such a way during those events like
Dreamforce and Oracle World, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: it puts a strap, you know, it's painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you talk money and what it's going to
do for job creation and revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it's going to go away after two
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good way to endeavor into
potentially regulating more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a city is a no city, that doesn't mean
it isn't one that you should approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is a way to show them how
this might look and what it can do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment that's a short
duration and strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is some other event that is
taking place, if there are businesses like
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda says, or hotels that are going to
come and support you and say, this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: strategic alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are coming together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are business owners in your city and we
want to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what's going to get you over the
threshold or cross over that line is these
[SPEAKER_02]: are other business owners that are
constantly giving ROI to the city and that
[SPEAKER_02]: they already trust and vet your strategic
partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these should be businesses that the
cities already have a trusted relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: with and they'll help usher in and steward
that conversation and give you an
[SPEAKER_02]: overarching sense of credibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diane, any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other thing that I wanted to
add, I guess, to what's already been said
[SPEAKER_01]: is that, again, in Colorado, we have a
significant amount of tourism as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's gone up incrementally since
legalization happened there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're talking to these local
municipalities, let them know that tourism
[SPEAKER_01]: by itself might increase between 2% and 5%
over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you incorporate cannabis tourism
into that, it's more likely to go up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what we've seen in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, tying it back to revenue and job
creations and communities, that's always a
[SPEAKER_01]: good starting point so they can see the
benefits that will come of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect transition to cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so let's discuss what is cannabis
tourism and maybe, Diane, who wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: field it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis tourism can be a number
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be signing up for a bus tour where
you can consume on the bus and visit
[SPEAKER_01]: different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's a musical event tied to
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could be more specific,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mentioned the puff, pass, and paint
events that were going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my experience, when people are coming
from a state that they don't have any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of legalization, people want to see what
it looks like in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're very intimidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you pick the right one?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to have a good experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they rely on other people to put
together a whole package for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes the worry out of their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I picking the right place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to have a good time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all done for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can tap into the other
tourist events that are already happening
[SPEAKER_01]: and just make cannabis another part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's talk about legal considerations
for operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of contracts and
also disclaimers that go into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to bring cannabis into
another business, make sure that that
[SPEAKER_02]: business isn't jeopardized by the cannabis
overlay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it goes back to what we talked
about earlier, ensuring that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: provisions that would prevent this type of
activity in a lease, dealing with the ABC,
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with the liquor board,
dealing with when you're bringing people
[SPEAKER_02]: into an event with cannabis that they are
responsible consumers, that you are not
[SPEAKER_02]: advancing any opinions that the dispensary
may have, making sure that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: lawful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are bringing outsiders that don't
know cannabis into a tourism situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you are vetting the operators that
you are working with, making sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have an active and approved license,
because you're a conduit for bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: people in to these business situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ABCs of good business transactions,
they apply in this instance, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: you are a cannabis tourism conduit where
you don't specifically touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a cannabis tourism operator in
Sonoma County who was recently sued and a
[SPEAKER_03]: temporary restraining order was imposed on
that cannabis tourism operator because the
[SPEAKER_03]: tourism operator took some tourists to an
unlicensed cultivation site that got sued
[SPEAKER_03]: and they looked at the Instagram photos of
the tourism operator at the unlicensed
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation site and they got roped into
this litigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what you're saying makes
perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an excellent example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, maybe Amanda, you already talked
about this earlier about cannabis events
[SPEAKER_03]: being magnets for cannabis tourism and the
economic synergies that can result.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you elaborate on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're looking at this,
how do you get government comfortable,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's key to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of places that are wait
and see but there's very few things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can try on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't say, I'm going to maybe
experiment with allowing cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: take it away because you're going to end
up in a Calaveras County situation and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody wants Calaveras to happen to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a city would rather do something
like this as a way to test out what this
[SPEAKER_00]: might look like, feel like, what the
people are that are going to show up,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a really good way for them to test
this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so easy for them to feel the
economic impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about sales tax revenue
generated during that event in the city
[SPEAKER_00]: across all businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is data they can quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also, when you're going
to a city, you can bring that quantifiable
[SPEAKER_00]: data from other cities to show them what
that had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you also have to look at a place that
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't go throw this in a city with no
hotels unless you're looking to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: camping event that has camping grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do it in a place that has this
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to also do it in a place
that's super wealthy because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily need that revenue and want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be mindful of the who,
but they can see in a very short period
[SPEAKER_00]: what this can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you tell them, OK, now imagine
you could even put 1% sales tax on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: it specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could start talking to them about
reasonable tax rates because they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it first without taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to see what general
sales taxes generated there based on
[SPEAKER_00]: regular pricing, regular hotel pricing,
all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a conduit to talk to them
about a more responsible tax rate from the
[SPEAKER_00]: start because a lot of these cities got
told these stories from some consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: firms, not to be named, who gave them very
lofty ideas of what they could generate in
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes with a 5%, 6%, 7% rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you combine that on top of
regular sales tax on top of state taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's becoming prohibitively expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by using something like this event as
a conduit to just show what the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulus can be on an economy,
now we talk about, oh, wait, now with an
[SPEAKER_00]: actual license and a business that's got
their foot there, we're talking about new
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs, we're talking about ongoing
revenues, we're talking about people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to live there and shop at the
grocery stores, not just eat at your
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurants for two days, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really use this as a conduit to
make them understand the overall economic
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulus on a city and then lean into the
next conversation that they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, but let's add some taxes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help you start a more
reasonable taxation conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's discuss quickly how operators
can ensure that local governments have a
[SPEAKER_03]: positive experience so that they will
incentivize these events.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll just start with Diane and work
our way back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would definitely invite them to
the event that you're planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know just in advocating that
when you can make it personal,
[SPEAKER_01]: either by telling your own story or the
story of someone that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people will buy into it much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So invite them into your dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invite them to tour your facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know how responsible you are,
that you've got these standard operating
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures, you've got tight security.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're following all these inventory
control measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really making them comfortable with
who you are and how you're running your
[SPEAKER_01]: business is the way to open the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a business plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds basic, but if you're going to go
in and have a conversation, know the theme
[SPEAKER_02]: of your event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know who's going to attend your event.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Amanda said, know what numbers you may
be able to generate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to put people in
restaurants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to put people in hotels?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to have strategic
partnerships?
[SPEAKER_02]: And use this as an opportunity to change
the perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all cannabis ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all cannabis stewards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you set the bar for your event and
say that you will not tolerate
[SPEAKER_02]: irresponsible consumption, that you will
be evicted from the event immediately upon
[SPEAKER_02]: those plans, have a plan for security.
[SPEAKER_02]: At every point that is a concern or that
would be a concern for the city,
[SPEAKER_02]: go in armed with an answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we're going to deal with odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first event, maybe we don't allow
flower smoking, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we limit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the city that you want to have an
event in have an anti-smoking,
[SPEAKER_02]: no smoking ban, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what questions you are likely to be
asked and how you have the answers,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the worst thing is to say,
I have a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an event I want to do in your city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the first thing that the city
manager or somebody you encounter asks is,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, what's your plan for security and
what's your plan for odor?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's crickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to get far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're talking about how you have a
culture of responsibility, how you change
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis stigma, these are the things
that are going to change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than the dispensaries, it's how you
interact with the product that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: change the conversation and change the
perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got such an amazing gift with
2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that plagues the cannabis
industry is one bad actor ruins it for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have nice things if you don't
respect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a real nice gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing that we can do is respect
it and demand that respect of your
[SPEAKER_02]: attendees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a more practical point of view,
too, yes, don't be a jerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have to say it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about the community,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy local.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care that the costs go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The street's going to save you $2 a pound
on your steak that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy it at the local grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care that the chairs cost $0.50
more from the local supply company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy from the local chair company your
rentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put as much of the spending that can be
done for preparing this event into the
[SPEAKER_00]: local economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, if you are making a boon,
make a charitable donation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations, to the Little League.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are we going to not let kids into
this event, we're going to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: this adult event benefited kids,
too, by helping repair the baseball field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what the community cares about
there and do your best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job and giving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pay dividends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who in the local jurisdiction approves
cannabis events?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda?
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city can set that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can delegate that how they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Sacramento, city manager,
a lot of places it's going to be council.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of license or permit does one
need to organize cannabis tours as an
[SPEAKER_03]: operator?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tour itself isn't going to be a
licensed activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: An event has to take place at a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the person that's operating a tour bus
is going to need a tour bus license,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a cannabis license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you have a delivery service delivered
to an unlicensed cannabis event?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlicensed cannabis events is the problem
in that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer was already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a trick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well drafted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you speak on what you know about
preparing your own products to sell in an
[SPEAKER_03]: on-site consumption setting?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does this align with state testing
requirements?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a complicated question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the quick answer is,
you know, on-site consumption needs some
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of local approval for it to be legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state doesn't really regulate on-site
consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we have some consumption
lounges at the local level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they get a local permit,
there's no corresponding state license for
[SPEAKER_03]: a consumption lounge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a workaround for AB 2020 not
allowing alcohol sales and consumption on
[SPEAKER_03]: the premises of a temporary cannabis
event?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a good old legal answer of
it depends, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're working with the locality,
if the locality is going to say we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want alcohol where there is cannabis,
they can put that condition if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to issue an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, first and foremost, you're going
to want to separate those two uses out and
[SPEAKER_02]: not combine them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to see this as an
evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally would like to ask the ABC
what their perspective on this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been noticeably silent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen OSHA step out in front of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen the ABC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are they going to look at with
regard to their liquor licenses and their
[SPEAKER_02]: liquor licensees?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know specifically with hotels,
they are concerned about this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have to go to their
insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to take it all the way back when
we talked about contracts, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what your insurance limits are,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're entering into a contract and
you're indemnifying the location that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have this event so that
you can get them on board, know what their
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance limitations are and what your
insurance limitations are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if there's alcohol sales there and
that invalidates either your insurance or
[SPEAKER_02]: the location's insurance, somebody
consumes both alcohol and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's the story that's splashed
across every headline in California and
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you don't get nice things,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we all come, it's funny,
but we come back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until you have trust between
operators, localities, and the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: you may not be able to combine two
psychoactively enhancing activities,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not be able to have alcohol where
you have cannabis at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to be responsible, respectful,
and earn some trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a lot of flack from alcohol,
beer, beverage, tobacco companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can focus in, earn that trust,
and start to see what that looks like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have a more meaningful
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be hard to do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the workaround I've seen for some
cannabis events is outside the premises of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis event, there is a separate,
I call it the A camp from the rainbow
[SPEAKER_03]: gathering days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the alcoholics camp on the outskirts
of the rainbow gathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the cannabis beer,
I'm sorry, that's where the alcoholic
[SPEAKER_03]: beverages get served.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackie?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not selling cannabis.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did was they had separate
buses that were outside of the premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were not, the alcohol was
being served inside the premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a regular alcohol serving facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then people could leave their alcohol
inside, leave the licensed premises,
[SPEAKER_00]: and go get on a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bus was private property,
nonpublic, dark windows, so you can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: out, and they were able to consume there
legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side by side, but without the two mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol had to stay inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, I mean, maybe if it was on
blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is that California
law prohibits smoking inside vehicles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bus is a vehicle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's on blocks and it's not mobile,
it's no longer a motor vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop an anchor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Private property would be a place where
you are concealed from the public and
[SPEAKER_00]: where not visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not a government land,
like a park or a school or the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a private parking lot inside
of a vehicle that was not detectable from
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were all the arguments I would be
making in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is, is you may get to court.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give your friends cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a dinner party at your home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't sell cannabis at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called a dinner party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giving away less than an ounce is legal
for adults 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're selling to adults 21 and over,
it's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Selling to under 18 could be a felony.
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, if you're inviting a brand
to sponsor and they bring cannabis to give
[SPEAKER_02]: away, that's a different scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that brand get the cannabis to
your dinner party?
[SPEAKER_03]: Question back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be our last one, because they're
giving us a hard stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one last question.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for attending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
