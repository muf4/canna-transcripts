[SPEAKER_02]: So as a practitioner and business person,
where do you see it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I think the
golden age of innovation is kind of behind
[SPEAKER_00]: us just in California in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I still think there's going to be
innovative products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are still going to happen,
but it's not going to be a proliferation
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the rate that it has been in the
last three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or the last five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hard to repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And primarily because once, especially
once metric kicks in, right, the track and
[SPEAKER_00]: trace and R&D and the cost associated with
it are going to be kind of stifling
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's not going to be an
abundance of cheap, readily available
[SPEAKER_00]: biomaterial that you can just experiment
with and then, you know, compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the technological
advancements are going to be far more
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific as we attract scientists into
the industry, which would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount of products that are on the
market now, I think you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there'll be new ones, you know,
to replace them, but just not the abundant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that we've already had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're seeing that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, you know, there's
significantly less types of products and
[SPEAKER_00]: less skews than there was in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my company, for example,
we cut half of our skews.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may bring them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the testing and the inventory
requirements, you know, many, many
[SPEAKER_00]: companies have dropped what aren't their
top producers and sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and, you know, I also see it going to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's kind of sad because I
always felt like California should own the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States marketplace, especially the
California marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, because we don't have
access to, you know, basic tools that most
[SPEAKER_00]: other businesses get, such as banking and
loans and deployment of capital at
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Canadians are coming in and for
better or worse, they're actually allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of us to survive because they can
bring in institutional capital and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: us to scale our businesses and get through
this trying time right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, twenty five hundred plus clients
in the entire state in December shrunk
[SPEAKER_00]: down to four hundred now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's six thousand plus manufacturers
in the state that are trying to sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: same four hundred dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't charge more money for our
product and our margins are less than
[SPEAKER_00]: they've ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think we'll get through
this and it'll be a strong, strong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's things are changing
and they're changing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what trends have you noticed
in the last couple of years that have kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like come on and fizzled out or
replaced other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Rosin was like the cannabis
equivalent of Kel back in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where, you know, where are we at now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for us at Eden Labs, you know,
we've made ethanol extractors since the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of what we built the
company on and it kind of faded out and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was all CO2 from 2010 till a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden ethanol made this
roaring comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we've we've made some
adjustments to the systems to for the
[SPEAKER_01]: modern cannabis ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've come up with a system of being
able to steam distilled terpenes first and
[SPEAKER_01]: then do the ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been the major change we've
seen within our company is all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: people wanting ethanol again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's I love selling the CO2 and the
ethanol systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy that they've made a,
you know, a comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how these trends start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the industry's got a lot of like
things just kind of appear out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he probably can since he's actually a
processor, you know, we we find out quick
[SPEAKER_01]: and we we offer a new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know how the trend got
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think I think AC wants to come
join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has so much to say over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think, you know, I think primarily
the trend with ethanol really uptick
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation came onto the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And became more commonplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very wonderful solvent that plugs
really well into a thin film or molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation or short path.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the most efficient way to just get
a bulk extract that you can short path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's predominantly the reason why it's
been so popular.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think some of the trends start with
someone having a success and then it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of broadcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the ethanol comes on because of
the hemp products coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp is not a clever product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're trying to get CBD and make sure
you're not having the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not trying to get out the terpenes
most of the time from the hemp product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a very clever product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with ethanol, and you can do it at
room temperature, you can do it at zero
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees, 10 degrees, minus 10 degrees,
minus 20 minus 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: So between minus 38 minus 43, it's
starting ours to act like subcritical CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the timing will be about the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have the same sort of process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at that, it kind of moved
from that very non-clever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start to have more of the
distillation, which for myself as an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic chemist, it's just not a very
clever process either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just bring it over and at some vapor
pressure, it comes over and drops into the
[SPEAKER_02]: other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I think things will move towards a
more clever side is not using ethanol as a
[SPEAKER_02]: distillation, but using it through organic
filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking organic filters, there's a
process where if I even have ethanol,
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter where it came from, it's a four
to one, or if it came from an ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction at whatever temperature,
I can bring it through something that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: 600 molecular weight ethanol filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything greater than 600 stays on
this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything less than 600 goes through the
path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in essence, I've taken out my lipids,
and I've taken out my waxes, and I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: done any thing extracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done any heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just pushed things through a filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you move to the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take that and you move it through a
200 molecular weight filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everything greater than 200 stays
on this side of the filter, and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: less than 200 stays on that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethanol is less than 200 molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you haven't done a distillation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just separated it through a filter,
and all you're left with is between 200
[SPEAKER_02]: and 600.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cleverly enough, the cannabinoids are
between 200 and 600.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now without having anything,
you have about 2% ethanol without having
[SPEAKER_02]: to do any extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll see that as a flow through
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the smaller ones will still do
separate modules.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start to move towards 350 acres
of different hemp, now you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a process where you're just going to
move through this thing as an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now your chemistry works better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see the innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll take one more exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is I don't think it's over yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the same thing as everything
that's been invented has been invented.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the next generation out
there that's between 25 and 40,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the older ones, well, Fritz is still
under 60, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just under.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just under.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so next year, I get to collect
Medicaid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on my side, I'm seeing the organic
chemists come through, and they're the
[SPEAKER_02]: next innovators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have the ones in the middle
that are paying for college.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to risk anything to move
through a career.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those 25 to 40-year-olds, they are
going to come through and just ramp up
[SPEAKER_02]: this entire thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the next golden age comes from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's so much innovation out
there that what we don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that they're going to come out
with some stuff, like the filters,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're not having to do
distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also just continuing breeding for
certain cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've fantasized about having a THCV
cartridge in the marketplace for years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really working with selective
breeding, or I'll say it because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy, but CRISPR technology, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be terrific to have innovations
where these more obscure, harder-to-find
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids now are able to be easily
produced, easily cultivated, maybe grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that you will see a lot of
innovation around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
