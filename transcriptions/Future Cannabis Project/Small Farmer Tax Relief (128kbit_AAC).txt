[SPEAKER_01]: What's the action plan for these small
farmers who have been there for 30 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think tax relief especially for the
small farmer would go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just the inability for the small
farmer to compete price-wise against
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate cannabis that's coming in and
growing tens or hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was some relief there for the
small farmer on the tax side of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could actually compete with that
market a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really sad to see there was movement
to have the cultivation tax cancelled
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: For multiple years and then re-institute
it in a more responsible way down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bill didn't make it through and I
feel like in a lot of ways that was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the knife or the dagger in the heart
for the small farmer is to not pass that
[SPEAKER_00]: through the legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a thousand cuts like Swami
says because there's different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: they've just chopped this you know one
piece at a time but definitely that's
[SPEAKER_01]: there and I don't know how like you said I
agree completely a small farmer can't
[SPEAKER_01]: compete against I have one big company's
got 500 acres you see the stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting right now it's just
amazing the size and scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: you you you you
