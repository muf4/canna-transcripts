[SPEAKER_01]: Scott we have a bunch of living soil,
JDAM, KNF enthusiasts watching right now
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know you run a lot of You you do a
lot of experimentation and so can you talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about maybe like I love that you I don't
know if you still have your home bro,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like it seems like you're always
Experimenting there to you know prove or
[SPEAKER_01]: disprove things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about some things that
you've been experimenting and what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: learned?
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's related to pests or plant
growth, but generally the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem of microbes plant roots and
plants and soil and all that stuff Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess deep I guess I guess to clarify
Yeah, my wife Sarah and I we we use our
[SPEAKER_00]: personal home grow to really just Go
bananas on and that's one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: why I rarely showed is because I don't
think the mindset of the average Viewer
[SPEAKER_00]: from the internet can really wrap their
head around what we're doing They just see
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's mold in my garden and they
say I don't know shit, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand They were purposely put it in
there so that we can get repetitions on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to defeat it so that I can confidently
go into a Facility and fix things and so
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, so the last run that we did we were
you know I purposely let him get moldy so
[SPEAKER_00]: we could clear it out the run before that
I took in some spider mite infested clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and duped it out with those and then and
So that's what we do because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my job is fixing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a sports background So if
you're gonna be asked to hit home runs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world series, you better do some
batting practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The stuff that we've seen is pretty
much completely removed any fear of a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem From us just because we've seen
such horrific problems and navigated
[SPEAKER_00]: people out of them using living soil
techniques To kind of tie in what Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying earlier Is we come into these
facilities that have a dysfunctional?
[SPEAKER_00]: Attachment to genetics and there's a lot
of times we come in with a new cultivator
[SPEAKER_00]: To renovate a property and the property
owners insist that they maintain genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a lot of experience taking
clones that were contaminated with things
[SPEAKER_00]: like Michael butanol and avid and all the
things that you're not at all supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: use but during the times of problem they
did use and so what we found is If you
[SPEAKER_00]: have good mineral density in your soil and
you have high populations of good soil
[SPEAKER_00]: food web organisms all the things that
tissue culture claims nature also has a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy for And so, you know if you have
really high biological populations If
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a virus in the plant the plant
has the ability to kind of quarantine it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a branch and it'll form like this
really weird callus almost like it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: Like scar tissue You know a lot of the
things that tissue culture claims that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefit Good living soil biology and
good mineral density can also provide
[SPEAKER_00]: those same benefits There was one
particular farm that Had plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: you know coated in systemic fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were treated with avid things like
that And we actually put them into a good
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil system vegged them out we
hacked out the That first biomass that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out and threw it away that next round
of the biomass that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cloned ran through propagation and into
the flowering and all that flower tested
[SPEAKER_00]: clean so and about a You know six-week
period we're able to clean some plants up
[SPEAKER_00]: get them ready for production And the
flower tested clean which actually kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: blew the mind of the lab Stay all all the
lab said that there was no way That was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know we were just tinkering And
so I think there's a lot of untapped
[SPEAKER_00]: potential out there that people have no
real idea exists because You know the
[SPEAKER_00]: people the people that did that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely don't tell anybody about
it and that was back in I was in like mid
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017 when we did that and you know that
farm is definitely not That information
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a tremendous advantage in
the market if you can clean up problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: a few weeks You're not gonna share that
with your neighbor We did that with when
[SPEAKER_03]: the years ago would before it before the
dark heart said that they found the virus
[SPEAKER_03]: Rick Crum was a virologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know Rick but crumb
and a couple guys from I say UCLA brought
[SPEAKER_03]: us plants and Alan Atkinson and I had a
conversation about using Biologically
[SPEAKER_03]: driven methodologies to increase natural
resistance and would it work against a
[SPEAKER_03]: virus?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so next thing I know I guess some
virus plants with me and I was able to do
[SPEAKER_03]: the tests and we were able to get the
plant back to Functionality to where it
[SPEAKER_03]: had no change because we had already had
labs on it prior So I knew what it did
[SPEAKER_03]: when it was clean and then we saw what it
did when it was affected And then we saw
[SPEAKER_03]: what it did after the cleansing,
but it didn't remove the virus It just
[SPEAKER_03]: brought it to a level that was workable So
we kind of we used an analogy of it was
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like the way Magic Johnson was
able to get HIV to a level that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: almost non-detectable and non-invasive in
his life it doesn't change the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: he still holds it in his body and so TC
doesn't change the fact that good
[SPEAKER_03]: biologically driven methods of production
are to me are the the best way to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant's Resistance high and and I think
that it helps shed and scrub issues But TC
[SPEAKER_03]: is is by far the only it's you're not
gonna get that virus problem any virus out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the plant completely you'll just get it
to a workable level and what we found was
[SPEAKER_03]: when we took those plants and Then put
them into any other environment other than
[SPEAKER_03]: that biologically driven went back into
like a chemical situation The biofactors
[SPEAKER_03]: that allowed that to function weren't
present and we don't know which ones they
[SPEAKER_03]: were because the you know, it's too
complex it's a combination not a single
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and The stress would then if the
plant got overheated if it had too much
[SPEAKER_03]: salinity You would see it start to exhibit
these viral Traits and I didn't get a
[SPEAKER_03]: chance to do the any work with them after
that point But I would love to have seen
[SPEAKER_03]: the the change in a viroid issue within
the plant meaning how much obstruction was
[SPEAKER_03]: in the vascular bundles Relative to what
was there prior?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm someone who is like my farm is
biologically driven and I don't seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: have any issues up top and I'm grateful
for that But I do a lot of containment
[SPEAKER_03]: where I don't let anybody go up the hill I
don't have any neighbors and I make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that My mineral density is as high as I
can drive it so that the plant has as much
[SPEAKER_03]: natural response as possible But I still
think that you know science in in
[SPEAKER_03]: preparation preservation of things that
are damaged and to protect the nursery
[SPEAKER_03]: operations the tool to hold and clean I
Don't see us ever going away from it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I definitely advocate tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't necessarily saying it's
definitely a tool that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented and You know can provide a
great benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just necessarily saying that like
nature has a lot of strategies for these
[SPEAKER_03]: things Yeah, you know, yeah Totally
totally and I fully agree because you and
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had this conversation many times
about Once the bottom end is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant seems to work out the problem
pretty well Once once we have the correct
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient balance the plan is an exhibiting
stress symptoms that bring insects on Once
[SPEAKER_03]: our once our epidural layers are
adequately built we we don't Seem to have
[SPEAKER_03]: probing insects penetrating and causing
the problems but the the thing is that I
[SPEAKER_03]: know that it's a it's a secret you want to
keep for the For yourself because it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: market advantage But the situation is that
you're you're I mean, that's why I try to
[SPEAKER_03]: give information out all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that we're in the beginning of
building an industry and that if if more
[SPEAKER_03]: of us survive the better and what that'll
do is it allow a much better unity as An
[SPEAKER_03]: industry you have the ability to have
success success builds finances finances
[SPEAKER_03]: build lobby Lobby builds influence and
that's what we don't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any of these things and so a
lot of this information that's why you
[SPEAKER_03]: know these type of little symposium we're
on today is killer because it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: unfiltered shit, but you get it in a real
opinion and I think they know that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the part that has to get shared is that
the big picture has to be shown and Then
[SPEAKER_02]: the details that has to be worked out
individually Yeah, if we can only if only
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody would get together It's it's
it's it's a process we're getting along
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, you know So we we've all all of
us have had common interest on projects
[SPEAKER_03]: that we wanted to see succeed and we try
to do the best we can and I think that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what the the public has to see meaning the
grower public is that So much of this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is complicated and a lot Of times
the only way you're gonna succeed is if
[SPEAKER_03]: you share the information the larger
corporations They all believe they have
[SPEAKER_03]: proprietary IP each one lets me know we
have all this top-secret shit and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: like, it's a fucking injector Yeah,
no hybrid state-of-the-art all these,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're about to show the world,
you know, easy yeah, I'm like You ain't
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna show anybody shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a paint sprayer in there You You You
You You You You
