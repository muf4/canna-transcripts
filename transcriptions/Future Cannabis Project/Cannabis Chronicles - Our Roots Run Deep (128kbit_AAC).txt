[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thanks for joining us everyone for
this panel today, and thank you for
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Gemma Pacacci, and I will be
moderating a discussion today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk louder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the host of the Cannabis Hour on KZYX
and Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bi-weekly radio program focused
on all things cannabis, and I'm also the
[SPEAKER_01]: owner and operator of Wildland Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here today in the Farmer's Forum,
so check us out if you get a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank Redwood Remedies and
Soldi Mendocino for sponsoring this panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maynard Kaminsky, our videographer,
Jake Martin Wagner, and KZYX for the audio
[SPEAKER_01]: recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: This panel is part of Cannabis on the
Coast, and the proceeds from this event
[SPEAKER_01]: are benefiting the Mendocino Coast
Children's Fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a special thanks to Pebbles here for
helping to organize this event and this
[SPEAKER_01]: panel today, so thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to get started, and we have a
great group of panelists here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm honored to be here with this group of
community elders, so thanks for having me,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can't wait to hear you share your
stories today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go through and introduce
everyone that's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First up is Pebbles, an outspoken teen
inspired by the Montgomery, Alabama bus
[SPEAKER_01]: boycott.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pebbles Trippet helped integrate public
lunch counters in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1960.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the 60s, and beyond,
she was a peace activist against the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnam War and the draft, and supported a
woman's right to her own body,
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom of choice, sexual freedom,
medical freedom, and a just world based on
[SPEAKER_01]: equality.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was there as a co-founder of CMI,
the California Marijuana Initiative,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first statewide initiative for
personal freedom in 1972, as well as a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the 1978 San Francisco Marijuana
Initiative, leading to the double
[SPEAKER_01]: assassination of Supervisor Harvey Milk
and Mayor George Moscone three weeks later
[SPEAKER_01]: in retaliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the end of an era.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 80s and 90s AIDS epidemic led to the
Dennis Perrone Brownie Mary voter approved
[SPEAKER_01]: Prop 215 in 1996, the right to use,
obtain, possess, and cultivate medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, but not to transport it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Todd Micaria testified in court on her
behalf that the cannabis is a drug of
[SPEAKER_01]: choice historically for migraines and that
she uses it legitimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pebbles is the migraine patient cited in
Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pebbles spent a decade litigating the
right to transport marijuana for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes prior to Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 10 arrests in 11 years with
prosecutions in five counties and jail in
[SPEAKER_01]: four for transporting cannabis as medicine
before the law changed, she appealed all
[SPEAKER_01]: convictions as unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: While a Mendocino County resident,
Pebbles' trippet prevailed and won three
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the right to transport medicine you
can legally possess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, the quantity standard, an amount
reasonably related to one's medical
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three, retroactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pebbles co-founded Medical Marijuana
Patients Union in 2000 and developed a
[SPEAKER_01]: working relationship with Sheriff Tony
Kramer and DA Norm Verome for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pebbles is senior editor and token female
columnist for Skunk Magazine and is
[SPEAKER_01]: calling for an elders council to preserve
and protect the cannabis culture as we
[SPEAKER_01]: exit prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Pebbles for being here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next up, I'm going to introduce Cecile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cecile Cutler, also known as Ananda,
was brought up in New York City and moved
[SPEAKER_01]: to San Francisco, California, drawn by the
Summer of Love in 1967.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her journey to India in 1972 changed her
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: When she returned to the U.S.,
she moved to Point Arena and learned how
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: She also learned yoga and Tai Chi and was
a teacher of Tai Chi at Marin College for
[SPEAKER_01]: over 25 years, as well as Mendocino
Community College in Fort Bragg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her Tai Chi source book was published by
Harper and Rowe.
[SPEAKER_01]: She also worked in publishing as a book
designer at Simon and Schuster.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a masseuse drawn by the love of herbs,
Ananda was searching for the magical
[SPEAKER_01]: formula, an element of healing massage to
relieve pain as well as psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all kinds of things that people tell
me about.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that end, she presented her original
combination, hemp sap, a concentrated
[SPEAKER_01]: compound made from the whole hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight herbs are listed in combination with
cannabis, which enhances and quickens
[SPEAKER_01]: healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is my inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: At her 90th birthday celebration last
month, Ananda was the inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her accomplishments and longevity,
a life well lived for the greater good.
[SPEAKER_01]: She describes herself, I'm not who I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nobody and that means everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a citizen who loves herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have RJ, also known as Richard
Jergenson.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020 is the 50th anniversary of
Mendocino's own cultural icon,
[SPEAKER_01]: the protopipe, invented and manufactured
by two local brothers, Phil and Richard
[SPEAKER_01]: Jergenson.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unbreakable brass and it is an
all-in-one smoking piece, including a
[SPEAKER_01]: hood, multiple holes in the bowl,
cleaning access, storage space,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a poker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jergensons lost control of protopipe
after a 1986 paraphernalia law made it a
[SPEAKER_01]: federal crime to export metal smoking
pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a long hiatus, Richard and Phil have
regained control of the pipe and are again
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing it in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard is an avid archivist with a vast
museum of documents and artifacts telling
[SPEAKER_01]: the story of the 100-year demonization of
the cannabis plant with an emphasis on the
[SPEAKER_01]: back-to-the-land movement and how it
helped to jumpstart the solar industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: His cannabis culture collection contains
hundreds of books, magazines, and news
[SPEAKER_01]: articles that are culture and catacentric
and is reputed to be one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: inclusive sets of original articles and
documents on the American youth
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's panel is about amplifying the
voices of these community elders and
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to the stories of their
experiences here in the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to ask our audience
members, how many of you live in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Triangle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many of you grew up here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many of you are visiting from
elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's great to see a mix and thank
you to those of you who came from
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere to hear our stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many cultivators do we have in the
group?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like to know that, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to begin this the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start my interviews on the cannabis
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is by going to each of my
panelists and asking, what is your
[SPEAKER_01]: personal relationship with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pebbles, would you like to start?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mary Jane, my old friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see marijuana as a friend, basically,
as a close collaborator and companion that
[SPEAKER_03]: understands me and treats me very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm down, the herb lifts me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm too agitated, it calms me down.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm consolable, it consoles me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love all parts of the plant,
the bud, the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what made me busted with was the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe in that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And root tea is the new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe in Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I revere Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is at the same time the
center of my life and has basically shown
[SPEAKER_03]: me the most wonderful way of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful Pebbles, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cecile, what's your personal relationship
with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1974, when I started to be a grower and
pack water into the woods on my back,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also practicing yoga, hatha yoga,
and it helped me with my practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during the course of growing,
I read High Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was an article on the goddess
Ziwa, Z-I-H-U-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the goddess of marijuana,
purple marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, in my garden,
when I was growing, one year, there she
[SPEAKER_02]: was, all purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she became my spiritual guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not something you can see and
know, but I felt that she kept guiding me
[SPEAKER_02]: so that I learned to make herbal products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And continued to grow many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And had many associates in Point Arena who
grew along with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a natural food store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of us grew plants to finance the
store and the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a motto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was food for people, not for
profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd have meetings once a month,
and we'd bring our herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we trimmed it at our meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a very, very open time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned how to be involved in a
collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I felt that this was all the guidance
of the spiritual side of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a science now that many people
would call plant spirit medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every plant has a spirit, or maybe
more, as people have spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the spirit of marijuana has supported
me, and loved me, and guided me,
[SPEAKER_02]: and helped me develop as a human being.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my relationship with the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love her.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Cecile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're both a very hard act to
follow, and I feel very honored to be here
[SPEAKER_00]: with both of you and with all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me,
[SPEAKER_00]: my awakening to this magical plant began
in 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rock concerts were just coming
onto the scene in large venues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd outgrown small clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate enough to go and see a
band called Vanilla Fudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the warm up act for Jimi
Hendrix and the Experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I was a non-cannabis
smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a 3-2 beer drinker, because that's
what it was in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few months later, I had my
first experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we partook of it before going to my
next concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And life has not been the same since,
I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it was a band or if it
was a plant, but it was a little-known
[SPEAKER_00]: band that had never performed before in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were flown in at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the story goes, they were paid
$1,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the band, it was the last time they
were an opening act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Led Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't sure if it was the magical
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it was the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thus began my journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started realizing after
experimentation, and it was a really big
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like so hidden to be
smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I realized that there was
something really wrong, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why were we lied to about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it pulled back the veil of
illusion that I had been force-fed that
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a bad, evil plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized, well, if we're being lied
to about this, what else are we being lied
[SPEAKER_00]: to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of became a truth serum for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still is to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows me to see things a little
differently, to put a different spin on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just so grateful to have been
exposed to the wonders of this magical
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that the future of this
plant, because it is a female plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the future is for this,
I don't like the word industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's a feminine future that
we're heading into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a great sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love hearing what you all have to
say about your experiences with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it's very spiritual for
everyone up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad we all relate on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that way with my own personal
relationship with cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to ask all three of you,
when you came to Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_01]: did you come as part of the Back to the
Land movement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was that anything that was present in
any of your lives here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can just bounce around,
you know, the first person who thinks of
[SPEAKER_01]: an answer.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You came as part of the Back to the Land
movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of a collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were renting and living in a warehouse,
a 25,000 square foot warehouse in
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wonderful things were happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were manufacturing electrical
generating windmills back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was generating alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the landlord decided to double our
rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were planning on moving up to
Mendocino at the end of our five-year
[SPEAKER_00]: lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this happened about three years into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we radically accelerated our moving
date and didn't quite have the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure that we were hoping to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a crash landing, but we walked
away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Back to the Land movement very
much spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's a large part of my
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the dissolution of the Summer of
Love and everything that was happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bay Area, which was the cultural hub
for the youth movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people, thanks to the Rolling
Stone Magazine and High Times and Mother
[SPEAKER_00]: of News and so on, go to the country and
buy some inexpensive land and build a
[SPEAKER_00]: house and grow a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came by the thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of us are still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wonderful things have happened as a
result of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very much part of the Back to
the Land movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came to San Francisco because my hippie
daughter ran away from home and was living
[SPEAKER_02]: on Haight Street.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had to see her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not live apart from her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also had experienced the wonderful
green herb in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was already a pothead, or I would
like to say that it was the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the entertainment part, but the
transforming part that attracted me very
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of my experiences when I had a
marijuana pipe full of very good weed was
[SPEAKER_02]: I hallucinated a temple in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had never even heard of such a
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I felt the expansion of the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being in San Francisco,
it was very natural for me to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I came here back from India,
I took a ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a postal van.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to the dunes to meditate.
[SPEAKER_02]: With my herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that I had to live here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I was attracted to the ocean and the
possibility of growing grass in my
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I came.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, Pebbles?
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to move here in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was a landless back to the lander.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was not feasible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I immediately stored it as the place to
return to, which I did 20 years later in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1994.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two partners of mine agreed to sign on
as tenants in common.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really recommend this because each
person owns an equal part, whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: mom and pop or three anarchists.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cannot confiscate your land without
the other people agreeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And presumably, you have the trust of
those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can feel very secure in this
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Liz Pindons, they take it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have too many violations, civilly,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was able to secure a place in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the 70s, Mendocino just couldn't
accommodate someone as grassroots as I
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: As myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I went to San Francisco and got in
with Dennis Perrone and Brownie Mary and
[SPEAKER_03]: that crowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: And introduced myself really to cannabis
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the people who later were responsible
for organizing Prop 215, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: where I came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all of those years I was getting
busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the whole decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was because of what I was introduced to
through them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my commitment, of course, is above all
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after that, my commitment is to adjust
society.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means to the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the initiative didn't cover
transportation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, it didn't cover cultivation
in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just had possession obtain you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So possession, well, that isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That brings up the miracle ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where is that coming from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Valerie Corral in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is here of most as in spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Include cultivation or I won't support it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, okay, Valerie, you got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they included the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't have such access on
transportation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just getting busted all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a concept that it had the
connotation of smuggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going too far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lawyers mixed it along with
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was incumbent upon somebody to
challenge that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lawyers had no interest in
challenging that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when they saw it was me who
they would be representing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had my own opinions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had to go in alone often.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that worked out better than being
represented by the lawyers who simply
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't keep up with my principles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a principled approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, after the transportation was
allowed, the court said it's an implicit
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going pretty far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just nobody ever asked them, what do you
think about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, well, of course you have to
be able to carry what you can possess
[SPEAKER_03]: legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And okay, yeah, she's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from then on, it was kind of in my
ballgame.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lawyers came forward to say they
wanted to represent me, but I feared that
[SPEAKER_03]: they wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I went on to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things is this 1993,
it's called a cert petition.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went through the state courts,
got denied at every level you have to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you belong about losing, so you get
your chance higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went into the federal courts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a procedure where if you
raise constitutional questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can go as high as the US Supreme
Court.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you only raise statutory,
you know what the statute says that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They stop you at the appellate level in
the state court.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody ever gets to go further because
they know exactly what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_03]: they stop almost everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was the challenger and the court
agreed with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tells me that our community needs to
understand that the court may be way ahead
[SPEAKER_03]: of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have not been asked the
questions by the people who have a case,
[SPEAKER_03]: a proper case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm critical, I need to say this one more
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm critical of the lawyers because
they're too timid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just think, oh, the conservatives up
there, they'll never go with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how do you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've never asked them, the liberals have
never done anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may be more or less equal and may
just be a matter of the times and how you
[SPEAKER_03]: bring a case.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my own community did not want me to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted the lawyers to handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could see the lawyers were not
handling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in one case, they wanted the patients
group to be exempt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elvie Musica is an extreme patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: She could easily die from the brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she qualified as a necessity patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of us are not necessity patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not die or go blind without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what a necessity patient is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wouldn't have covered any of us,
any of the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I tried to go in there and with my
own brief that would be adoptive alongside
[SPEAKER_03]: of the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my own comrades said, we will do
nothing to enable you to file that because
[SPEAKER_03]: you will make us lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the problem is we're already so close
to losing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And years later, the lawyer came to me,
ran across the parking lot to tell me,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we were wrong about that and we
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was actually during all this time
when the Back to the Landers were making
[SPEAKER_03]: the difference in the country and paving
the way for all the rest of us and
[SPEAKER_03]: non-forest and their four quiddles at jury
trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just those are broad
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_03]: While that was happening, I was doing my
best to be prepared for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: future that was going to be better than
what's unfolding right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Pebbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually love the group of panelists
that we have here because I see that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have several different experiences and
perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two people that were out here
growing cannabis, living the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have Pebbles who was down in a more
urban area fighting for us to have these
[SPEAKER_01]: rights that we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone here contributed in their own way
to make up the community that we currently
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that I wanted to make sure
we covered today was all of your opinions
[SPEAKER_01]: on what is going on in our community as we
move out of prohibition and into
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopes and fears, how you would like to see
this all play out, what are your opinions
[SPEAKER_01]: of what is going on right now,
and most importantly, how we can preserve
[SPEAKER_01]: our values as a cannabis community as we
move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whoever has the first thought,
feel free to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me have a small comment or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought that when legalization
came that it would look like it has
[SPEAKER_00]: unfolded where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure what I was imagining it to look
like, but after having done a fair amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of research on alcohol prohibition,
I mean that's kind of somewhat of an
[SPEAKER_00]: example to drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of messes with your consciousness
a little bit depending on how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had about a 12 year prohibition on it
and once that was lifted then huge
[SPEAKER_00]: industry was created.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was already a huge industry in
people making their own bathtub gin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really fueled the jazz time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really wasn't a good template for
cannabis, but as you look around there
[SPEAKER_00]: really weren't too many good templates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotine or tobacco never had any
prohibition, so you can't really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a drug and it's destroyed and
continues to destroy thousands of lives a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, unlike cannabis which doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know it's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we are at today, I mean I just,
the talk this weekend is, I just found out
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, that Flowcanna is going to be
featured on 60 Minutes tomorrow night,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I kind of grew up watching 60
Minutes and it was a really important TV
[SPEAKER_00]: show and the whole family would sit around
Sunday night and watch 60 Minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for them to come here to Mendocino
County and to be documenting our story is
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating and I understand Casey O'Neill
is also going to be part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exciting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see it as soon as the
electricity comes back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, predicting the future is
always pretty iffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been very good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big industry certainly has shown up
and I've seen personally so many mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: pops having to fold up and sell their
property and move on because they just
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been able to afford the licensing
process or figure out the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've lost a lot of the culture that
came here in the late 60s and the 70s and
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s that helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if paving away is the right
metaphor, but did a lot of the groundwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's a time warp.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not experiencing something that is
normal or smooth in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nothing like people who imagined
just cut the punishments would be the next
[SPEAKER_03]: phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Punitive bet has nothing to do with this
innocent, benign herb and the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: are associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our crime is the association.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the right to associate the First
Amendment with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But reality is that it's the most popular
plant drug on earth, the most lucrative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we who were the caregivers,
the caretakers, the stewards of the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and the environment all of these decades
are the ones that have the upper hand that
[SPEAKER_03]: is being taken away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are trying to steal the knowledge
base through these regulations that make
[SPEAKER_03]: no sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulations that would make sense is
that they went to the people who are to be
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated and sat down with those people
and said, let's have some kind of a round
[SPEAKER_03]: table here and come up with something that
we can all live with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They created their own concept of the
green rush that was going to come to the
[SPEAKER_03]: county and imposed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are about 300 people in
Mendocino County out of what, 10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: families in line waiting for that
proverbial permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're toying with us because we're
in between prohibition and adjust
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation, reasonable regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in between that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're nowhere near.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have put in place five different
agricultural commissioners to employ it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've all quit or been fired within
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's proof that they're doing it
backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those ag conditioners, what was his
name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just walked away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just not doing it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should go from the grass roots up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should start with what exists and
work from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his idea was the opposite of what's
going on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel that regulation has put us in
jeopardy as a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are very vulnerable under this new
policy, which is to go after any and all
[SPEAKER_03]: unpermitted gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's most of us do not have a permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Judging by the 300 out of 10,000 and
that's because we're waiting to see how,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it opens up, if there's anything to
help us survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of that is to basically take
it all away from us, to leave us very
[SPEAKER_03]: reduced in our power.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not want to share power with the
cannabis community, which we want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we were sharing our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 40 years of heritage and hand on
experience, and they're not taking
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage of it because they don't know
the time of day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think it will work this other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're showing them that it
will not work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But meanwhile, the corporations are coming
in and the corporations were let in by the
[SPEAKER_03]: government.
[SPEAKER_03]: That five year plan that's in Prop 64 just
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the leg in, just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the corporations went in ahead of
the basic regulations and they are in
[SPEAKER_03]: place right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of our own people are getting ready
to sell and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're in a hole, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You reach out for hands to help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel that's what the community needs
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk about this hole that we're
in, that they're putting us in and that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're allowing them to put us in because
we don't know what to do about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm suggesting that there are a few of
us who've been talking for over a year
[SPEAKER_03]: about an elders council that will guide
the ship that's coming down, whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something very grassroots, community
based.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with structure, the dreaded idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we don't have any.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a voice, a cannabis voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are four of us, Richard
Monson, who have agreed to kick off a
[SPEAKER_03]: plan, like a skeleton of what an elders
council would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically it would help preserve the
culture, enhance the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And great developments as they come
through and give truth to the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-biased, with no agenda kind of truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, Governor Newsom has given the
order to the National Guard on the Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: border to go up to the Mendocino County
forests and rid the forests of the people
[SPEAKER_03]: who have unpermitted grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now that they've moved out of the
forest into the general population,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've removed the forest land as a
limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any unpermitted grows are the target
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a letter in the AVA a few weeks
ago from someone who had seven plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was so furious.
[SPEAKER_03]: As he told his story, they came after me
for one additional plant and they took all
[SPEAKER_03]: my genetics, years of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Oman is saying only the hundreds,
only thousands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there was one that was 65 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't mention the one with seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's because they're preserving
their interest to keep control.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this transitional period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's in our interest to get control of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: To start with who we are, have emails is
the easy way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just how do we imagine doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe monthly gatherings of people in
each other's homes where you can talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bringing the music back and having our
culture consolidated that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But something that would move out of
prohibition where we don't talk to each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the plant will take us,
will guide us to the best place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that the arguments are on our side and
they're against those who are trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they never earned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never did anything that came along in
trying to steal it and we can't let them
[SPEAKER_03]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have ideas as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know about some of Pebble's
concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first thing I think is missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the world is in chaos and many of
our systems are falling down and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing them all decaying and breaking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And primarily it's our political system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're trying with what is said here
to break into a broken system that has to
[SPEAKER_02]: be repaired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel that there is a mistake that has
been made right along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to have a real green movement
that this plant is an agricultural plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it needs to be taxed like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone can grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course there's a medical division.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a specialized unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, there are many intoxicating
plants that are already in use as
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy yohimbay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy kava.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy, well, other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not familiar with, but I know that
there are many many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of these plants have a healing
side and a medicinal side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need a green, like a green party of
marijuana so that we think of it as an
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely honest farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely has the benefits of home
life with a family that can support its
[SPEAKER_02]: children and not have any kind of
criminal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to work to repeal any kind of
federal law that is still in existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: While that law is in existence,
and while the politics are broken,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is corrupted in a way that
makes it go industrial and packaged and
[SPEAKER_02]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no education to deal with the
amount of products that are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what we're dealing with is
something that can grow like tomatoes or
[SPEAKER_02]: mint or lemongrass or oregano.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be able to have that kind of
freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is linked to the freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of us have been political activists
and we've seen freedoms continuously have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be brought down, brought to its level
of what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, our freedoms have taken away by
playing this political game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need a green movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to keep using that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to encourage growers and
educate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a matter of fact, it is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Willets, I know, in Willets I think,
there's going to be a very large
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic marijuana grove that is
commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely a need for it to be
an agricultural plant that is popularized
[SPEAKER_02]: with medicinal specialties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the political game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is too corrupt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see how it is right from the top all
the way down to the bottom with lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: payola and lots of corruption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's misleading.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're farmers and it's natural for us to
create and grow, to grow and create
[SPEAKER_02]: products from our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: To add onto that, back when this was
called the New World, all the new
[SPEAKER_00]: colonists who came to the New World were
given seeds to grow, to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to sign on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to come to the New World,
then you're going to become a hemp farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people did until they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, the big drug was tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the Boston Tea Party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Politics, taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really lost our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring up a dear friend of some
of ours here in the room, Julie Ciarello,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been championing, along with Scott's
Magazine, something she's calling the
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great word use and
something to think about rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Green Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look closely at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that politics belongs to
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd asked me this year ago,
I would have denied it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's very clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the culture belongs to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're putting way too much energy over
the years, myself included, into trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: influence their politics when they've
already got this plan that they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: nurturing for years, pretty much going
forward as anticipated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much to my surprise, our input,
since we didn't have any effect on Prop
[SPEAKER_03]: 64, we dropped out and did not contribute
from the 2010 election to the 2016
[SPEAKER_03]: election.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's six years after Richard leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were fighting each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were fighting over nuances.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not unified well enough to pull off
anything like a unified action.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we have to start with
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking that I'm going to pass
this around.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the invention of the century.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is protopipes all in one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, it's brass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbreakable brass.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put a truck over it instead of
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a demonstration outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Richard and his family produced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are lots of other little
inventions like this that are just
[SPEAKER_03]: unnoticed, unrecognized, that we could
bring to gatherings that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that thing that covers a pipe so
that the herb doesn't fall out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a little rubber band.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a three-hole pipe turns out four-hole
pipe had five holes to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one lot older than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, pass it around too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning was the one with the heat
shield on it to keep you from burning your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers because it was brass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, in our factory, we called this one
Stakesides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took getting ripped off by somebody
with a lot of money that saw us selling a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these on Telegraph Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ripped us off and put them in a,
he had an idea to capitalize on the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and the pipe sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, I'm going to etch the name tomato
in it and put it in a tin can and seal it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and put a tomato label on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just, he made a cheap gimmick out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then we didn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't called portal pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a, we had a name called
contrivance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't, you know, we were trying to
figure out what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew what we had, but you know,
boy, coming up with a label is really
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took getting ripped off for us to
put our heads together and to reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull in a few close friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did, and immediately we created
Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the guys came up, he meant to
say prototype, and he accidentally said
[SPEAKER_00]: protopipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went, that's it, Eureka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you didn't have the internet
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took a long time to figure out how
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Navigate the legal system and we did
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a mere slip of the tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was reaching out, creating Synergy with
like minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this guy, we just knocked
him out of his orbit because he had a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't, but we were clever lads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgive what my point was, other than this
one's a lot older than that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year was that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would go back to probably about 73,
74.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still the improvement one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 1.0, that's a 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically the 3.0 actually has two
new patents on it that this one does not
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a 50th anniversary in the
wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our 50th is, wow, right at the Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be our 50th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should give them a fundraiser because I
think it's the oldest truly Mendocino
[SPEAKER_03]: based invention in the canvas culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be wrong, but in my knowledge of
what's going around, nobody even comes
[SPEAKER_03]: close to the 50 years that protopipe has
stuck it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're having trouble just like any
small business, a kind of small business
[SPEAKER_03]: all over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really feel like we should give them
some space at the Emerald Triangle and
[SPEAKER_03]: some centrality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 50th anniversary of what?
[SPEAKER_03]: A brass pipe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's glass everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go into Spark, there's nothing
but glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, where is the protopipe?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's brass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they take me way over here and on the
bottom row.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not known.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a 50 year old startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the protopipe is but one of many
treasures that you brought with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you like to take some time to
talk about your wonderful archival
[SPEAKER_01]: collection that you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you twist my arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did write something up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I could breeze through it pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1970, my older brother Phil designed
and fabricated a unique smoking pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I just pulled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was called the contrivance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that Denver was not a place to
launch this business because nothing was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in Denver in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws were very much a red state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But San Francisco is where the totem drum
of the counterculture was being beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where Rolling Stone was and
that's where it was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he moved to San Francisco to launch
this pipe train.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as he could, he called me up
and said, it was a long distance phone
[SPEAKER_00]: call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telephones were kind of a big deal back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody called me up and he said,
I got a small warehouse space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick, why don't you come on out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd just gotten my draft card number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, there was a very unpopular
war going on called the Vietnam War.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought a huge box of goodies,
but there's just no room to share it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, the Vietnam War was,
the United States had only been in it for
[SPEAKER_00]: 14, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that country has been a war for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 years of exploitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we were the latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The French pulled the Americans into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wars always need young men.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a big appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they created a lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's birthday went on a ping pong
ball, went in a big hopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your fate is determined by the pick of
the draw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a lot of friends who got pulled
out pretty early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could either leave the country,
go to Canada or Mexico or Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could go to college or university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I chose that route because I didn't
want to leave the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, mine was the last ping pong ball
pulled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that meant I was never going to see
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't need to stay in a place that
wasn't fulfilling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dropped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved to San Francisco to also chase
the pipe dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a few years of making a lot of
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made every mistake you could for a
young star.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew nothing except we were clever
young lads that were just resilient and
[SPEAKER_00]: just kept going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you fall down, you get up,
and you learn to walk through crawling and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was about six years before we really
started figuring out our price points and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to set up an assembly line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Bay Area was very good to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very creative place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd already told you the story about
getting knocked off by the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we created synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pulled in a couple of new partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all had skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Berkeley was an exciting place
to be, San Francisco area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created a corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my partners, Larry Todd,
too many people know him as Dr. Atomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cartoonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was published with Last Gasp in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was good friends with the creators
of the Furry Freak Brothers and Fritz the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat and all of these other really curious,
fun to read publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really helped to normalize the
hysteria around cannabis, marijuana as it
[SPEAKER_00]: was called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so meeting him was a game changer
because he could not create incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I had one of his comics
right here with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't him, but this is like Furry
Freak Brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows the Furry Freak Brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so many know Dr. Atomic, but Dr.
Atomic was absolutely epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he took our graphics department
and really started doing some incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of his, right behind Tim there,
it's called the Class K Mansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a scene that many of us
recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know somebody that lived there or that
built it or maybe even we lived in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a trailer that has various
add-ons attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a garden and there's some can of
plants out front and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a blue tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an iconic image that is very
native to Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it still exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was out of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an iconic image.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we heard that there's several of
these up in the Covillo area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in one myself when I first came
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, for those of you who
don't know, Class K is the Mendocino
[SPEAKER_01]: County Building Code that allows you to
build your own home to reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get two inspections as opposed to
one for every process along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, business was looking up and we
started doing trade shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started traveling and setting up
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go to a new town and you look for
somebody with long hair or bell bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a record store in town?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a waterbed store in town?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd have to seek these things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every once in a while, you get lucky
and find a place that would sell music or
[SPEAKER_00]: posters or waterbeds and beanbag chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they had a small pair of vanilla
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see firsthand this culture
sprouting up around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot of fun doing road trips
and trade shows and festivals and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in time, we started advertising in
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started off in Rolling Stone
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they stopped doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the new kid on the block was this
one here called High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is your first issue right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started advertising in High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Larry was doing our incredible
graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sales really started picking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on a national level, there was a
change in presidency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a president in there by the
name of Jimmy Carter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all thinking legalization was
right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: His son Chip had declared publicly that he
was smoking pot in the White House.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone was like, yeah, it's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a strange thing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy by the name of Ronald Reagan,
this former actor, and former governor of
[SPEAKER_00]: California, created this political
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we knew it, Carter's out and
Reagan's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things started getting really nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they indeed crafted this rather
draconian law on the exportation of metal
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd had a good run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, legalization is around the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to set this one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd already taken a lot of arrows in the
back being up here in Mencino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our local city council really wanted us to
go back to Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the county board of supervisors really
wanted us to go back to Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal wanted to come and represent us
because we were kind of a high profile
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't want the big attorneys to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that we could handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we created a petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started going around to events
wherever people were gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got people to, so we got several
hundred signatures on a petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went and went to city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we convinced them that we were good
for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we packed the council chambers with
everyone that believed in us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wouldn't let anyone else in,
but they drew the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 86, this new federal law came into
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let someone run the business for us
with the, once again, with the agreement
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want back in when legalization is
at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this guy changed his mind because it
was only a handshake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shame on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so he made millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we watched it from a distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very far because he stayed in Willis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made many millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of tough watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let go of the business in 87.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had no idea that it would take
another 30 years before the tide was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn in California anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, strange story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy ended up getting, we turned the
business over, he ended up getting evicted
[SPEAKER_00]: from the very shop space that we used to
occupy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it used to be our building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he got evicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back in there making these pipes
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He let everything lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to regain our name
through the Federal Trademark Office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're a proto-pipe once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to quote a popular song, it's been a
really strange long trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're in it for the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story is still unfolding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I wasn't just sitting on my
hands, and I'll try and wrap this up for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to speak real quick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to read this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now this marks my 50th
anniversary with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, let's say I've already said a
lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think I need to say this at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have been doing recently though
is I saved everything when I sold the
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out to be a really
fascinating thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother started me on this wonderful
ride by leaving this publication out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family used to subscribe to Life
magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she left this out for her two
teenage sons to read on the dining room
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that back there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever altering the course of their
lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that in Chronic Freedom?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the real magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: October 31, 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had no idea that this was going to
direct my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think she knew either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she didn't leave it out there for
me to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of owe my collection passion to
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to show it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was quite the archivist in her own
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started just collecting things
that related to the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know how much there was until
I was able to get a room and display it
[SPEAKER_00]: all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kept bringing it in by the box
load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, good god.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it took a few years to start moving
it around and putting together a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story is the emergence of what
came to be known as the counterculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of us that were principally baby
boomers growing up in the 50s and the 60s
[SPEAKER_00]: and coming of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a turbulent time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the peak of the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three months after this was Altamont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the death knell.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the date?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is August of 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the youth, this came out in
1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're telling everyone here is
if you don't like the way things are,
[SPEAKER_00]: go buy a piece of cheap land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't have to be in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the culture was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ads in the back of these are the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people are reaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, looking for like-minded
people to buy some land together with and
[SPEAKER_00]: share raising our families together with
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always dreamed of building a
geodesic dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know a lot of people that came
here to Northern California as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: these ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a result of this publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very seminal piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another seminal piece was the Whole
Earth Catalog, which came out in 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like, this was an internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for the first time, it gave people
access to books and tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideas and gatherings of like-minded
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this had a really good run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ran from 1968 until 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the last year that they
published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oddly enough, it was the internet that
caused them to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Richard, this is a good time to interject.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cincinnati Tips was the primary educator
of the cannabis community from 1980 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 1990 and then on to 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We invited him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said that he wishes his best.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he is basically here in spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also the O'Shaughnessy's editor,
Fred Gardner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was invited.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was supposed to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's the one who kept the medical
culture alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without O'Shaughnessy's, we wouldn't
really have had anything all this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk Magazine covers the culture,
although that came later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have very much because it's a
hard life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's usually done by poor people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Fred Gardner puts out this tabloid
newspaper because he's poor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just all he can ever afford to
get the job done.
[SPEAKER_03]: This group of people, especially the
publications editors, are long-suffering
[SPEAKER_03]: central people in our community like
virtually nobody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have the archives.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the archives to show that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that writing things down,
we should do more of that so as to save
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, like we talk, it goes into the
ether.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hard to pick up the thread from
one week or month to the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you write it down, you have a
record of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you get somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rosenthal was saying to Dennis Paroon,
you don't have to sell weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do things legitimately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he opened up a publishing house and
was the only one who actually sold weed
[SPEAKER_03]: books all of those decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he survives to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go into a court of law,
write it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll laugh you out of the courtroom if
you don't have it written down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to change from a handshake culture
to ones that do the basics that you must
[SPEAKER_03]: do in life to trust the people you work
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legally binding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you don't have to know them very
well if it's on the paper what you agreed
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a real problem with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A huge problem with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we don't want anything to be
written.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops will get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops are not the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our own community knowing what each other
are saying and doing is the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping an agreement, making each other
accountable, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we're moving now into this new era
in our community, we do have a great need
[SPEAKER_01]: to preserve these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great when we find people like
Richard who has been saving these objects
[SPEAKER_01]: for so many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's about how do we take these
objects that he has in these publications
[SPEAKER_01]: and how do we share them with the greater
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we share Cecile's stories and
how do we share Pebble's stories and
[SPEAKER_01]: Fred's stories and Douglas's stories and
everyone else's stories and make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't get forgotten as we move
forward into a new time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering, you have the idea of the
elders council.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering, what each of you think
about ways that your generation who has
[SPEAKER_01]: paved the way for where we are today can
interface with the younger generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: community members so that we can make sure
that these stories get preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important to share this knowledge
because I think that the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: generation doesn't have the same
experiences that you all have had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can speak for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a younger cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the knowledge that you all
possess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important that it gets
preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that I love about the
cannabis community is that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-generational community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have many friends in Cobolo that are in
their 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they share their information so freely
and it's so valuable, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: possible for every young person to
interface with every elder in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important conversation to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cecile has an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just because I developed a product
called Mendocino Hempstaff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought some samples for people here
who attended our panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And December 8th, there's going to be an
herbal conference in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will bring my product there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had other ones other years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there have been other Mendocino
educators there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I teach people how to make some of my
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach them personally or I write them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or by the way, as we all know on the
internet, YouTube has how to do
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn how to make any kind of
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to just say a word or two
about some of the products for people here
[SPEAKER_02]: that they can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can make themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is if you soak buds in olive
oil and make sun tea, like on the
[SPEAKER_02]: windowsill, if you leave it there for
three weeks, buds in the olive oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you then strain out the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have wonderful sleep medicine,
which you have half a teaspoon of the
[SPEAKER_02]: olive oil bud mix, which I call bud mix,
sleep bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it on a cracker or take it
directly or put it on a piece of toast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other product that is being used
legitimately by people in the ophthalmic
[SPEAKER_02]: community is marijuana, the whole plant,
which I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, if you soak it in alcohol and
make an extract out of it, that extract
[SPEAKER_02]: will keep the pressure in the eye down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a glaucoma remedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not put in the eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is taken constitutionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by educating people on home herbal use,
we can all popularize the agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: herbal use that is medicinal that you
don't have to buy in the store that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: make for our families and teach our
children how to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are nearing the time at which I
know we wanted to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we're going to take a short break
if that's OK with everyone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will reconvene in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, Mary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good, Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get some water,
use the restroom, stretch your legs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we're going to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to chat some more,
and we'll do some Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're still electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: The restroom is upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
