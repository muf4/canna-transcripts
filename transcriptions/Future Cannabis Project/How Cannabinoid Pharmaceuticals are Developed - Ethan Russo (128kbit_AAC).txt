[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, this is Jason Wilson with
the Curious About Canvas podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for tuning in once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm joined by somebody I've been
wanting to talk to for quite a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ethan Rousseau.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ethan, for being willing to
take the time to sit down with me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I almost struggle to figure out
how to introduce you because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different angles I could take.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were involved at one point in getting
Sativex going and approved, is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for 11 years I worked for GW
Pharmaceuticals as senior medical advisor
[SPEAKER_02]: and medical monitor, study physician in
development of Sativex and Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then you also on the side are
involved in a lot of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: broader research and education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I've been involved in cannabis and
cannabinoid research for 23 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, quite a quite a record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the some of the review papers
that you've written have been critical
[SPEAKER_00]: tools in the education work that I do,
like taming THC is now pretty much a
[SPEAKER_00]: classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a recent one you did to the
No Strain No Gain review paper about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the the complex, you know,
what we call the entourage effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call matrix effects,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, you've you've done some
really good work summarizing relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: complex ideas that are digestible to a
broader audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big issues right now is trying
to sort out whether people should have
[SPEAKER_02]: single compounds like single cannabinoids
versus whole plant extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm clearly in the latter camp for the
synergy, the boosting effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That these provide over and above the
kinds of effects that we can get with
[SPEAKER_02]: single compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of doctors and nurses that
I've spoken to that are doing clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: work with cannabis products in the United
States, a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pretty consistent message that
they've said at this point, they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: only want to work with what they term
broader spectrum extracts of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually like ethanol sourced that maintain
a wide diversity of phytochemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm interested to talk to you
about is what research data we have to to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're able to get better outcomes at
lower dosages with fewer side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can illustrate this by going back
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Historically, in 1985, synthetic THC as
Marinol was approved by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thought among certain people at the
time was this would obviate the need for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis treatment for medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, what we got was a drug that is
very poorly tolerated and gained no
[SPEAKER_02]: traction in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC by itself is a very disorienting drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: People tend to be dysphoric, unhappy
rather than euphoric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even people who are accustomed to cannabis
find THC in pure form, a very difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: drug to tolerate and very few people
remain on it for any length of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people have had the opportunity
to compare almost invariably, they prefer
[SPEAKER_02]: herbal forms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's been my experience,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good friend of mine that funny
enough to treat schizophrenia got approved
[SPEAKER_00]: for Marinol, which is sort of strange in
one in one sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he reported similarly that he had some
success with herbal cannabis, controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: certain positive symptoms that he was
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Marinol just didn't do anything
that the herbal cannabis did other than
[SPEAKER_00]: making him feel uncomfortable,
like physically unset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Settled is what he reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only person that I
personally know that has been on a Marinol
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, we have now a lot of
evidence, both laboratory and clinical,
[SPEAKER_02]: that much better results accrue when we're
dealing with complex mixtures from
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis extracts as opposed to pure
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: A recent illustration was a an article
from Spain, Blasco Benitez et al,
[SPEAKER_02]: in which they were looking at effects on
cancer, both in cell culture and in
[SPEAKER_02]: animals, comparing pure THC with which
work to some extent on treating the
[SPEAKER_02]: cancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in comparison to a cannabis extract,
there was much, much greater activity with
[SPEAKER_02]: very salient, statistically significant
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember there was some paper I
read that was looking at, was it TNF alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in mice that was looking at,
I don't remember the actual type of
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical extract that they used from
cannabis, but they were trying to compare
[SPEAKER_00]: to isolate and look at dose response
curves, essentially.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another good example was there was a paper
by Pamplona in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: That compared pure CBD, as would be an
epidiolex, to the results that people got
[SPEAKER_02]: with CBD predominant cannabis extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they found was equal efficacy,
but with the cannabis extracts,
[SPEAKER_02]: the doses were about, on average,
22% of what was required with pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of 1,500 milligrams a day,
perhaps 300 milligrams would be enough of
[SPEAKER_02]: the corresponding extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this can represent a substantial
savings in cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, with the high doses of pure
CBD, there is the possibility of drug-drug
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction, particularly sedation with
some of the drugs that are used in
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I know there's some concern
lately too, and there's controversy over
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it, but about the liver toxicity
of high doses of CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's a blind alley,
they'd be truthful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, lower dose would be better,
but the liver issues are mainly related to
[SPEAKER_02]: elevations of liver function tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in, generally children,
who are in polypharmacy with a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs, particularly valproic acid,
which is well known for being a bad actor
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of LFT elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my strong suspicion is that's related
to polypharmacy, multiple drugs rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than a specific effect of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an extremely good point to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the risk contraindications and
everything are very different circumstance
[SPEAKER_00]: to circumstance depending on what a
patient is taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would assume not just the other
medicines they're taking, but even
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly their diet, because I know there
are different dietary elements that can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would just add the point that I've
seen a lot of people conflate,
[SPEAKER_02]: even in presentations at conferences,
conflate the side effect profile of pure
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD at high dosage to CBD in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a fair comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that cannabidiol, despite its
many complex mechanisms of action,
[SPEAKER_02]: is an extremely safe drug with very few
adverse events.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean, there's a tidal wave of
research kind of coming out now,
[SPEAKER_00]: now that I mean, especially now that the
farm bills passed, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: universities now ramping up to study CBD
and hemp extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general with legalization movements
happening across the world, there are more
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers feeling more comfortable
taking on this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your opinion, where does the
research, particularly around CBD and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, need to go, I guess,
to elucidate some of those nuances that
[SPEAKER_00]: can help particularly physicians
understand what they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have patients that are coming
to them, telling them they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first and foremost is an issue of
the preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, it's sort of the Wild West out
there with online cannabidiol products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't vouch for the utility or safety of
any preparation without a certificate of
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to know exactly what's in it,
not just the cannabidiol content,
[SPEAKER_02]: but other cannabinoids, the terpenoid
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see evidence that it's safe,
that there's no pesticide residue,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiological contamination,
or heavy metal contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beyond that, I just won't comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would urge consumers to be extremely
diligent in trying to require that it
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bias is that that information should be
available for every product, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: medical or recreational at point of sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, it really is a matter of
what's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can have cannabidiol, but there is
almost nothing that cannabidiol does that
[SPEAKER_02]: will not be enhanced by having at least a
tiny amount of THC on board at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really synergizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These normally occur together in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds corny, but that's the way nature
intended it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what usually works best
medically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effects of a given preparation are
going to depend on those components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really can fine tune things in
terms of applicability to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: synergies towards treatment of specific
disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean is, for example, if we want to
treat a mood disorder such as anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can look for possible synergy between
cannabidiol, which has a proven effect at
[SPEAKER_02]: a certain dosage, plus an additional
component such as linalool, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: common component terpenoid that's also in
lavender, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's well known traditionally as
something that produces a calming
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-anxiety effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just one illustration.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what I'd like to see is that
there's a greater appreciation of these
[SPEAKER_02]: nuances of how cannabis can be tuned to
the individual need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and something I'm interested in,
too, that segues into another thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to talk to you about, which is the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to see research that goes
into how to characterize the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system tone more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really fascinating.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, let's define some terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The endocannabinoid system is the master
homeostatic regulator of physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, physiology is how things work in the
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, you need a certain level of
activity, neither too high nor too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's precisely what the
endocannabinoid system does, is try and
[SPEAKER_02]: keep things in happy balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a system is overactive, it tends to
bring it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's underactive, to bring it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This works through complex mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have endogenous chemicals within called
the endocannabinoids, specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-arachidonylglycerol, 2-AG for short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anandamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anandamide in particular closely resembles
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both are partial agonists at the CB1
receptor, the main psychoactive receptor
[SPEAKER_02]: in the brain and elsewhere throughout the
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this does at the brain level is
actually reduce the release of
[SPEAKER_02]: neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we have a glutamate neuron that
stimulates regulatory, the reduction in
[SPEAKER_02]: the release of glutamate will lower that
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good example of why that's important is,
well, give two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glutamate activity tends to be excessive
in neuropathic pain, nerve-based pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we have a person with chronic
neuropathic pain, we can either raise
[SPEAKER_02]: their anandamide level or supply exogenous
THC and bring that glutamate level down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's gonna help with pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly in brain injury, whether it be
trauma, stroke or things of that sort,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get an excessive release of glutamate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be so much glutamate that it
produces an excitotoxicity that the cells
[SPEAKER_02]: actually stimulate themselves to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have situations in which people suffer
a head injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might seem okay briefly and then
rapidly deteriorate over 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of that effect is from this
excitotoxicity from glutamate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're able to supply drugs like
cannabidiol or THC early enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of that can be prevented and have a
much better result clinically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those would be examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Endocannabinoid tone is an important
concept, but we don't have good ways of
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three important aspects are how much
of the endocannabinoids are present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second is, what's the activity of the
receptors?
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone is using THC at high doses
recreationally, the receptor number will
[SPEAKER_02]: actually go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the brain and body's way of trying to
keep things on an even keel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the receptors become inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they stop, they'll reactivate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is the number and status of the
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the amount of the
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third part is, what is the
activity of the enzymes that make the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids and break them down?
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, we don't have ways of
measuring this directly, except with
[SPEAKER_02]: invasive techniques, such as doing a
lumbar puncture or spinal tap to measure
[SPEAKER_02]: anandamide levels, but that's invasive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something you can do on an
experimental basis with most ethics
[SPEAKER_02]: committees, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally in the future, we would have
scans, non-invasive methods of trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: assess endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a dream for the future right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah, and measuring the
endocannabinoids, isn't it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated, too, because they're produced
on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like they're stored in vesicles
like a lot of neurotransmitters are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are in a constant state of flux.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not there for any period of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, they're a very hard thing to
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anandamide is rapidly broken down in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we are looking at serum levels,
which may or may not reflect what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on in the brain, the samples often have to
be frozen in liquid nitrogen and then be
[SPEAKER_02]: transported to a specialty lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not something where you can go
into your local hospital and get your
[SPEAKER_02]: blood drawn and see what your status is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking some very sophisticated
science here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and another thing that comes to mind
when I think about the complexities of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to measure the endocannabinoid
system tone is that the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system is not just CB1 receptors and CB2
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really complicated system that
overlaps with a lot of other physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and other different types of
receptors that would normally be
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with other systems in the body.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, no, it's a broadening concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked my friend and colleague Vincenzo
DiMarzo whether he now would consider the
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin 1A receptor part of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't hesitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How this comes into play is cannabidiol
was shown by my team at the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Montana back in 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabidiol is serotonin 1A.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're finding that that mechanism
explains a lot of activity of cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as its effect on nausea,
prevention of brain damage from ammonia
[SPEAKER_02]: levels and hepatic failure and a lot of
other mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another example would be cannabidiol is
also an agonist, a stimulant on the TRPV1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor, the same place where capsaicin
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, most experts consider that part
of the broad concept of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's amazing to me at this point is
for a system that's so fundamental to how
[SPEAKER_02]: our bodies work, this is not in general
taught in medical school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody can go through medical school and
learn nothing about cannabis or accept
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps its alleged addiction potential,
but unfortunately, it's highly likely they
[SPEAKER_02]: won't learn anything about the
endocannabinoid system, despite the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that CB1 is the most abundant G protein
coupled receptor in the brain,
[SPEAKER_02]: exceeding the number of all the
neurotransmitter receptors put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, it's really fundamental to
how humans work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's ignoring that system is like
having severe tunnel vision when trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about physiology, considering how
big of a role it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I've talked to other doctors that
are not because I'm originally from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi, so very conservative and
much, much more of a deficit of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding than, you know, you would
find out here on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I've talked to doctors about it,
I've tried to use terms that they might
[SPEAKER_00]: that might help them put that into
perspective, talk about icosanoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And G protein coupled receptors without
getting into some of the vocabulary that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can start to wrap their mind
around that and around how the body
[SPEAKER_00]: processes fatty acids and how important
those are for signaling and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't talked to anybody that's
close to it recently about whether that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: If medical schools are still ignoring,
you know, whether intentionally or not a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of information about the ECS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm afraid that's still the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a quite a deficit there
that I'd like to see rectified.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is myopic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's intellectually dishonest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder how much of it is born from
prejudices against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, you know, I know part of it
coming from where I come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just so much still taboo around
the idea of cannabis and a lot of feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're putting your professional
reputation on the line in order to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it in a in a serious way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one advantage of age.
[SPEAKER_02]: I no longer care about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are so I've got two things that came
to mind when we were talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is I wanted to come back around to the
serotonin receptor concept because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been shown that some serotonin receptors
and maybe it's the one you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes I get them confused,
but they're often heteromers with CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often appear side by side at times
and influence each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that has been noted in a number of
experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I don't always know what
the ramifications of that are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's always tough for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 67.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, my basic science training
was like 45 years ago and things change
[SPEAKER_02]: radically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I I'm like a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I've got a new journal article,
I think has pertinence to what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: investigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may need to read it three times to try
and get it straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So none of this stuff is simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a problem trying to translate this
into lay terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the foundation is so broad in the
endocannabinoid system and the details can
[SPEAKER_02]: be so extensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really defies simple explanations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, that makes it very tough
for the average physician to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: grab ahold of this when their schedule has
them seeing a patient every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not amenable to providing good
education to the patient about anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: let alone something so complex as medical
treatment with cannabis or the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have everybody has such a little
amount of time and mental bandwidth to
[SPEAKER_00]: wrestle with much of anything that to try
to tackle all this is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that I I teach about is try
to urge people to be cautious when reading
[SPEAKER_00]: research and trying to project the
clinical value of that, because so much of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid research, you know,
is cell culture models and rodent models
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little bit of human clinical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's wisdom to be gleaned from all
these these different studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's you've got to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, let's use an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to go back to the hepatic
damage from CBD issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an article that came out
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a rodent study.
[SPEAKER_02]: The doses of cannabidiol that they were
using purportedly producing liver damage
[SPEAKER_02]: would be impossible to attain in a human.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow this travesty passed peer
review and was widely reported by the
[SPEAKER_02]: media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has no correspondence to reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish that had been sent to me and I
would have done my best to ensure that it
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't deserve publication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of thing, unfortunately,
this kind of material is often produced
[SPEAKER_02]: with taxpayer money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's more than intellectually
dishonest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's downright dangerous and unethical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just perpetuates more
misunderstanding among not just a lay
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, but physicians and other health
care providers that are working with
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that are reporting use and trying
to conceptualize what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know that I got 10 personal
queries about it that I had to address and
[SPEAKER_02]: dispel what are just spurious rumors and
basically propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say would be some of the
more real risks, limitations,
[SPEAKER_00]: contraindications of herbal cannabis use
and extracts, depending however you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with that, that you think people
should know about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've got a public health crisis out
there right now with additives and vape
[SPEAKER_02]: pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got to mention that it is
important that people, again, apply
[SPEAKER_02]: critical thought to any development like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually has nothing to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has everything to do with additives
that are toxic that are put in these
[SPEAKER_02]: devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can happen with nicotine vape
pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could happen with cannabis vape pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll put the finger on the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have this situation if we had
legal commerce federally in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: had standards applied to any of these
products, because this is 100%
[SPEAKER_02]: preventable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If these things were available and
regulated properly, there would be no need
[SPEAKER_02]: for kids to be going to a street corner to
purchase black market vape pens with
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very briefly, I'm not a proponent of
smoking anything, particularly in a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaporization potentially is a safer
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're talking about medical uses
of cannabis, we're almost always talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about chronic conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that situation, best approaches are
for oral agents or tinctures, say in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that type of preparation is used,
it's got a much longer half-life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the need for more frequent
dosing is limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often people can treat their condition
with dosing two or three times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This offers other advantages in that there
are fewer peaks and valleys of activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You avoid what can happen with inhalation
where there's a rapid increase in blood
[SPEAKER_02]: and brain levels that is going to make a
person prone to psychoactive side effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically anxiety, paranoia,
things of this sort that are much less
[SPEAKER_02]: likely with a slow titration, slow raising
of dose, with an oral agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore the risks of intoxication,
reinforcement, withdrawal, and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: other effects can be minimized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the ingredients are key.
[SPEAKER_02]: People need to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can only come through regulation
because it is a situation, I can say
[SPEAKER_02]: without a lot of fear of contradiction,
that companies are not going to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: lab results unless it's mandated.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's all about the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if something isn't required,
companies are not going to spend the
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a happy balance there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to come on the side of safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an area of things I've directly
associated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent a lot of time working in analytical
labs, helping them get a credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on board methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen the response from producers
that complain about the testing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're required to do and the cost of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always thinking about what's that
total cost of the few hundred dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: $2,000 you might be spending on testing
versus the value of the whole batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: material you have and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even producers that say they value
product quality and consumer safety and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, I see a lot of that go out the
door really quickly when they're allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of skirt by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the endocannabinoid system a
bit, and we talked about a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but what are some misconceptions
that you think that people commonly have
[SPEAKER_00]: about the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you have a few in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the main problem again is ignorance,
just lack of awareness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really man on the street probably
doesn't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, his physician won't likely
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big part of my mission over the 23
years I've been doing this work has been
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the message I'd like to impart
is this is an important aspect of how we
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do even apart from drugs to
improve our endocannabinoid tone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The paramount lifestyle approaches that
would affect the system would be first,
[SPEAKER_02]: aerobic exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got good data, especially from the
animals and limited in humans that show
[SPEAKER_02]: that you improve your endocannabinoid tone
and overall wellbeing through aerobic
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans weren't designed to be sedentary as
is prevalent in modern society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one, which seems to be
taking on more and more importance is the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bacterial content of the gut.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the ills of modern society are
nutritional in origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing a huge increase in things
such as the metabolic syndrome,
[SPEAKER_02]: type two diabetes associated with obesity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is not normal in human
populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, we're seeing a situation in
which the American diet in particular is
[SPEAKER_02]: pro-inflammatory as well as having an
improper balance of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of this can be counteracted by
having a better bacterial balance in the
[SPEAKER_02]: gut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be attained through eating
more vegetables, more fiber, and
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly use of probiotics and
prebiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this can make a tremendous difference
in health and regulating the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask, is there any specific
research that you're aware of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: currently looking at those links between
the gut microbiome and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor expression or endocannabinoid
production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a developing area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a very interesting study that
was done in Canada, Cluny et al,
[SPEAKER_02]: that showed that THC didn't produces a
better balance in the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see development of obesity in
animals that are administered THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: rather they remain lean even in the face
of a high fat diet and a genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: predisposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a real developing area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that as really a key lifestyle
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people can use this kind of dietary
approach and hopefully not even need
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis quite so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and one thing that's exciting to me
is newer research coming out that's
[SPEAKER_00]: showing how different flavonoids interact
with the endocannabinoids system because
[SPEAKER_00]: it then opens this discussion up much more
broadly to talk about, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple reasons for that, flavonoids are
one, but to talk about diet and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of different types of plants
and everything that are also going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting cannabinoid receptor signaling
and endocannabinoid production,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that excites me about
cannabis in general as a natural products
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, because that's really my background
doesn't come from cannabis, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted the realm of cannabis given what's
going on these days is I like that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a springboard for people learning
about other plants and other concepts and
[SPEAKER_00]: rediscovering that, oh, maybe we should be
exercising and eating better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that will help medically more so
than a lot of other approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the last things I'd like to get
into, check our time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little bit more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back around to your work with
Sativex and looping around, I'm sure a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people are thinking, okay, cannabis has
therapeutic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's research going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming more and more accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a major push by a lot of
companies right now to get cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you, and I know it can be kind of
complicated, but as briefly as you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable, kind of describe to listeners
what it actually takes to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based pharmaceutical or
cannabinoid pharmaceutical actually
[SPEAKER_00]: developed, trialed, and approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that process is a little
more complicated than folks give it credit
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sure is.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most respects, the development of a
cannabis-based medicine as a
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical is the same for anything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis is a botanical, a plant-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a common misconception out
there that you can't make a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: from a plant, but it has been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though Sativex isn't available in
this country, it is approved in 30 other
[SPEAKER_02]: countries and it passed the chemistry
manufacturing control and the safety
[SPEAKER_02]: signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically what's involved is you have
to take your preparation and show that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's safe through toxicology.
[SPEAKER_02]: This means giving large amounts,
unfortunately, to rats and dogs and seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's put through phase one in which
normal people are exposed to the drug in
[SPEAKER_02]: varying amounts and you see how long it
lasts in the body, in the blood,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what the reactions of people are,
monitoring the side effects, if any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it goes to phase two.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this, moderate numbers of patients with
a specific disease are given the drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you're looking for efficacy,
safety, and then the other factor is
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you show that your drug, if it's a
botanical, it's going to contain many
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to show consistency of each
component within very tight tolerances
[SPEAKER_02]: over the duration of the drug development
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: The final step is phase three in which
large numbers of people with the disease
[SPEAKER_02]: are given the medicine, again,
to show safety, efficacy, and consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a point where a drug has passed all
those steps, it's FDA approved and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes about a year to designate a
schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a drug that has psychoactive
effects, it has to be put in a schedule
[SPEAKER_02]: that describes what its drug abuse
liability is, whether it has addictive
[SPEAKER_02]: potential, how often a physician can
prescribe it, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then label is developed and it goes on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about, generally,
from start to finish, a seven to 10-year
[SPEAKER_02]: proposition that will cost anywhere
between $700 million and $1.2 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one aspect of cannabis' medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, as we're seeing now in this
country, cannabidiol has been available in
[SPEAKER_02]: various preparations on another level
where people can access it without
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future, there are going to be other
cannabis-based supplements that should be
[SPEAKER_02]: also subject to safety and efficacy issues
as well as labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a final level or echelon of
activity which would be someone grows
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and may use it in a medical
context.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are these three different ways of
getting cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people make a mistake when they
think that one level can eliminate the
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much as the government thought that
Marinol, synthetic THC, would reduce or
[SPEAKER_02]: eliminate the issue of medical cannabis,
it never happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, we've got some counterculture
people that would just like to free the
[SPEAKER_02]: herb, so to speak, and forget about these
other areas of commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: God forbid a company would make money on
something that is God-given.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, those are extremes of philosophy,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some, like you alluded to,
already examples of how botanicals can be
[SPEAKER_00]: treated in a highly controlled manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example is looking internationally at
how drugs are handled differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the United States, you can get a
standardized ginkgo biloba extract and get
[SPEAKER_00]: a prescription for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm advising patients, I indicate
just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best ginkgo biloba extracts are EGB61.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were developed in Germany where they
have a thing called Commission E which is
[SPEAKER_02]: analogous to Food and Drug Administration
for herbal products.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things can be as safe and effective
or even more so than new chemical entities
[SPEAKER_02]: and prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess we'll just see how the FDA
decides to wrap their minds around all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can guarantee it'll be a slow
process because the level of understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: is not there and it's hampered greatly by
residual prejudices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there was an assumption when
the Farmville passed that all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD was legal and we're going to be able
to make dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean there's friction in the
law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congress said it's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the FDA and the DEA still
consider all forms of cannabidiol apart
[SPEAKER_02]: from Epidiolex as Schedule I forbidden
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the last thing that I've heard
privately from folks that are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with the working groups with the
FDA and CBD is that they're not very
[SPEAKER_00]: optimistic that the FDA is going to
provide much allowance for CBD and dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements and foods and that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we've seen this in Europe already.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a novel foods regulation that
basically has eliminated most CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: containing products.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we sign off here, I want to make
sure to get you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a conference to get to and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything we haven't talked about
that in the last two or three minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: here, you want to make sure to share with
anybody or even just bring up some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a big focus of my attention right
now is trying to educate and I like to use
[SPEAKER_02]: the catch term making cannabis safer and
better on that encompasses a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I think we need better genetics
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very malleable plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make it do anything that we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is not the need, in my opinion,
for genetic modification of cannabis or to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it from yeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The full entourage of compounds and
cannabis can be optimized by selective
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding without resorting to those other
approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the future is very bright in terms of
what can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'd emphasize safety standards
should be paramount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers need to be asking hard
questions, not just of their doctors,
[SPEAKER_02]: but of the purveyors of these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think marshaling our forces
together, we can greatly improve the
[SPEAKER_02]: situation as well as the public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we still have a long road ahead as
far as education goes and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's progress being made all the
time and I greatly appreciate the work
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope our paths cross again and perhaps,
you know, maybe sometime in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be able to do some educating
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for being willing to spend
the time this morning to get together and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really enjoyed it as I knew I would,
and I look forward to catching up with you
[SPEAKER_00]: again sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more, you can go to
cacpodcast.com or you can connect with us
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for curious about cannabis and
you'll find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it easy.
Thanks for listening.
