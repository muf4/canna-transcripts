[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ariel.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I want to do something first that's
going to be a little weird, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: cool, because we're going to get a little
bit weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can everybody stand up, please?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all a little sleepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably over-caffeinated at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could just put down whatever is
in your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't worry about being
self-conscious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all just going to shake a
little, OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: So start at the bottom, all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands up if you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shake your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one
[SPEAKER_02]: more audible exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, now we're ready to talk about
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a heckler already.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Bruce?
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you so much to the organizers,
to Ariel, to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a beautiful day, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get a round of applause for this
amazing day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm so honored to be a part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those aren't the slides that we had up,
but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know, based on evidence,
that psychedelic mushrooms have been used
[SPEAKER_02]: by humans since before recorded history
and throughout human history.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 1950s, there was some scientific
research and some development that was
[SPEAKER_02]: started by some noted folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoffman among them.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we know, in the 1970s, the war on
drugs, the war on intellectual freedom,
[SPEAKER_02]: on freedom in general was started with the
Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it pretty much thwarted all meaningful
research on psychedelics, psilocybin in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular, and really any advances were
stopped at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, today, we are seeing a
revitalization of interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And research in the use of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to focus on
today because of the time that we have and
[SPEAKER_02]: the panel that we've assembled for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple things that have led to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FDA has approved psilocybin again as a
breakthrough therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has allowed research studies at
Johns Hopkins, UCLA, and NYU that are
[SPEAKER_02]: studying the therapeutic impacts of
psilocybin on depression, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: end of life, and addiction treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coupled with that, we now have a policy
reform movement that is underway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver in May legalized or decriminalized
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why Denver's always ahead of
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's because they're a mile high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just are closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But good for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we now have other decriminalization
measures that will be on your ballots,
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to a ballot near you.
[SPEAKER_02]: One in Oakland and several other cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then decriminalize California,
which we'll hear a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_02]: because a couple of our folks here are
heavily involved in that campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, we wanted to have a high level
discussion about psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, you will learn something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may know a lot about it already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, you will learn something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you will take away something that just
makes you more curious about the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: about the policy reform, about the
research, about the mycology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sort of strain of knowledge or
curiosity that you take away from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the point for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we have an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can only kind of scratch the
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've spent a whole day talking about
cannabis and could probably do it for
[SPEAKER_02]: several more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same is absolutely true of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to help me whet your curiosity,
I have these three lovely people here to
[SPEAKER_02]: my left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to introduce them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to my left is Madison Margolin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Madison is an LA and New York based
journalist on the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelics beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has been published in Rolling Stone,
Playboy, lots of amazing publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has started Double Blind,
which is a journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad to know that so many of you
are familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was blown away by it when I read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautifully done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her partner, Shelby Hartman, is up here in
the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two amazing young women have started
what is really a groundbreaking journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you haven't seen it out in the
hallway, go pick it up and take a look at
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Madison is here to help us along this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next to Madison is Will Goss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will is a trained, he was educated in
plant genetics and mycology.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a mycologist, a forager,
a researcher, and he is currently the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycology director for Decriminalize
California, which is the ballot initiative
[SPEAKER_02]: that will be, God willing, coming to you
should they gather enough signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure they need volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the end is Dr. Michelle Ross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ross is a neuroscientist, a therapist,
you know, just an advocate and a
[SPEAKER_02]: researcher, both for psilocybin and for
other psychedelic and plant based
[SPEAKER_02]: therapies.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the research director for
Decriminalize California and the founder
[SPEAKER_02]: of Infused Health, which is an online
platform that helps people heal through
[SPEAKER_02]: magical plants and compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for letting me
introduce them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we hear about research around
psilocybin in particular being helpful for
[SPEAKER_02]: folks healing from depression,
anxiety, dealing with end of life,
[SPEAKER_02]: major illnesses, what is it that's
happening in the brain that makes that the
[SPEAKER_02]: case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent the whole day talking about
cannabis research, cannabis manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to switch gears a little bit
here with psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, just like THC, psilocybin is
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually changes our perception of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can rewire our brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many interesting things about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense that we're talking about
it in the same place as we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it all comes down to the default mode
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the default mode network is really
our state of consciousness, our state of
[SPEAKER_01]: being.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really controls what we think about
ourselves, what we think about others,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we think about our past, how we think
about our future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting about the default mode
network is that basically it's not active
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're consumed with thinking about
tasks or doing things or we're in a flow
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like really enjoying ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of have turned our ego off and
we're in the present moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're not really active,
when we're just sitting around,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're daydreaming, when we're
thinking about our jobs or whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: is, that's when the default mode network
is on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for certain different brain diseases,
there's actually either too much activity
[SPEAKER_01]: of this default mode network or there's
too little activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now really, what is this default mode
network?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bunch of brain regions that are
interconnected, that are communicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different parts of your cortex,
that front part of your brain that does
[SPEAKER_01]: all the thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's too much activity there,
like you have in depression, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have too much activity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you think about, okay,
I'm thinking that I'm worthless or I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking too much about bad things that
happen, you're just overthinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: ruminating, that's too much activity in
those brain regions and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pathological.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anxiety, you can also have similar things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also have different brain
conditions when there's not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actual evidence that shows that in
autism you have too little functioning of
[SPEAKER_01]: the default mode network and that maybe
underlines why there are issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: connecting with other people and also
understanding emotions in yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this default mode network is super
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So too little activity, too much activity
is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that right amount so that we
understand ourselves and our relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world and to our past behaviors and
future behaviors so that we can think and
[SPEAKER_01]: feel comfortable with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why are we talking about psychedelics
in this default mode network?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we actually know some things turn on
and turn off this default mode network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we know that cannabis, THC,
can actually turn off the default mode
[SPEAKER_01]: network and we know LSD can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know psilocybin, that active
molecule that's in magic mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: can turn off the default mode network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're trying to help treat
depression or anxiety, what you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for is to be able to shut off that
hyperactive network and maybe switch off
[SPEAKER_01]: those negative thoughts about yourself or
stop thinking about those traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And psilocybin is actually a tool that has
been proven in clinical trials to turn off
[SPEAKER_01]: this network and provide healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do a brain scan, you can see
these different areas and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, there's less activity there and you
might be able to correlate it with people
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about psilocybin mushrooms
being so effective for mental health,
[SPEAKER_01]: there really is nothing out there like it
that can really change these negative
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns, these negative brain patterns
and help people heal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you say a little bit Dr. Ross about
serotonin and microdosing and why is it
[SPEAKER_02]: that psilocybin as a compound mimics
serotonin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so it's really interesting that
actually psilocybin is actually broken
[SPEAKER_01]: down into a compound called psilocin and
it's, psilocin, I'm sorry, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually very similar to serotonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have this natural fungi-based
compound that fits in with our serotonin
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually activates a subtype called
serotonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 5-HT2A subtype and it's
responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all psychedelics simulate the same
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the serotonin system, it's not the
same as the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're not talking about cannabinoid
receptors, CB1, CB2, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: these serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now serotonin regulates everything from
how much we eat, how much we have sex,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we sleep, how we wake, how we sleep,
how we think and feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The serotonin system is what's
responsible, we think, for antidepressants
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really an important function of
our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if psilocybin containing mushrooms
contain these compounds that can stimulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the serotonin system, again, that's why
it's so important for mental health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I actually did a lot of research on
both mushrooms and on a process called
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And neurogenesis is the birth of new brain
cells in your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just happen when you are a
child, a baby, it actually occurs
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout life in an area called the
hippocampus, which is your learning and
[SPEAKER_01]: memory center.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that certain compounds can
actually boost this neurogenesis or brain
[SPEAKER_01]: cell development and can actually help
rewire your brain for healing,
[SPEAKER_01]: for healthy thought processes,
and sort of help, again, boost some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those pathways that are more positive
rather than those negative pathways that
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to depression that lead to trauma,
reliving trauma and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that psilocybin, like all the
other serotonin drugs, actually stimulates
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if we're looking at these
compounds, it's very similar to any
[SPEAKER_01]: substance, any psychedelic that is
stimulating your serotonin system is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to boost brain cell growth, it's going to
rewire some of our synaptic branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: and again, heal our brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a fantastic tool to really reset
our brain and set us up for healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to segue from that to talking
about the science of the brain to more the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to ask Madison to talk about
what she has learned about some scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: research around the concept of mysticism,
of having a mystical experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scientists are now starting to actually
quantify that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, I think, seven factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want Madison to talk about her
research around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's interviewed some of the
researchers who have an ongoing study at
[SPEAKER_02]: Johns Hopkins, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at a cannabis conference mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think from cannabis policy,
there's only two ways to consume a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's adult use or recreational and
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that leaves out the concept of
mysticism and spirituality as something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is also a benefit to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to lay it out, there is something
called the quote unquote mystical
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that science has defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been found that the stronger your
mystical experience, so the more criteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that you kind of check off during your
psychedelic trip or clinical session,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a correlation between that and the
extent to which you're healing from
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction, depression, end-of-life anxiety
in cancer patients, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin, it's not like scientists just
discovered that psychedelics can be
[SPEAKER_00]: mystical, right, for thousands of years
before this humanity has had a sacred
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, scientists began to pick up on
that around the 50s and 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1962, there was something called the
Good Friday Experiment that Walter Panky
[SPEAKER_00]: did under the supervision of Timothy Leary
and the Harvard psilocybin project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they recruited about 20 divinity
students from Boston University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nine out of 10 reported that they had
experienced spiritual highs with
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was in 1962.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then currently at Johns Hopkins,
Roland Griffiths, who's the head
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher there, is recruiting religious
leaders from all different faiths,
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbis, imams, priests, Buddhist rohis,
et cetera, to do psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the reason that religious
leaders are so important to this is that
[SPEAKER_00]: these are people who are already,
who are quote unquote, already familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with the idea of a mystical experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are familiar having that conversation
and using that rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the actual tenets of the mystical
experience are internal unity,
[SPEAKER_00]: so basically this pure awareness within
yourself, external unity, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling connected in oneness with all
other things, transcendence of time and
[SPEAKER_00]: space, and ineffability or paradoxicality,
meaning that it's hard to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience into words or that you would
need to kind of use contradictory
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions to really just to say what
that felt like.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sense of sacredness and an intuitive
knowledge of ultimate reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just sort of, if you've ever done
psilocybin, you maybe have come to a
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling of okay, everything is okay and
this is how it is and everything is right
[SPEAKER_00]: with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A noetic quality, which speaks to that
also, sort of feeling of ultimate reality
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a seven is a deeply felt positive
mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have, basically you're having a
quote unquote mystical experience of about
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 to 70% of this criteria are experienced
by the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so basically the main thing here
is that I see psychedelics as sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: intersection of science, the law and
spirituality or God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the mechanism of action that
people are, not the mechanism of action,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the way that people are experiencing
psychedelics and psychedelic assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: psychotherapy is forcing scientists now to
grapple with the concept of mystical
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going into the published
research and ultimately seeing now that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going through these FDA approved
studies, I think psilocybin studies are in
[SPEAKER_00]: phase two, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are three phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept of someone, of a patient
having a mystical experience with God or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it, is going to
pave the way for psilocybin to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal psychedelic assisted psychotherapy
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speaking of God, let's talk about
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will, what is the life cycle of mushroom?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get mushrooms from nature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, we have to understand
that mushrooms are in a different kingdom
[SPEAKER_03]: than plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually more closely related
to humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are heterotrophs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are heterotrophs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get our nutrition from out there in the
environment and not sunlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can imagine and try to imagine
a tiny spore, anywhere from four to 20
[SPEAKER_03]: microns in length.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that spore germinates or opens up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like the radical or first root of
a seed, you have the initial growth from
[SPEAKER_03]: the spore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's called hyphae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you see a visible mass of hyphae,
that's what you call mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hyphae is where all the action occurs
in terms of the metabolism until the
[SPEAKER_03]: fungus is turned on and ready to undergo
its sexual reproductive cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some fungi produce mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all of them do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you start with a spore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants have spores like ferns.
[SPEAKER_03]: These like prehistoric, really old evolved
plants have similar modes of growth and
[SPEAKER_03]: life cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the mushrooms that we're talking
about, they're spreading by spores and
[SPEAKER_03]: growing into their environment through
extracellular digestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're releasing enzymes into the
environment as well as metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acids, bases, basically they're trying to
create a suitable environment for their
[SPEAKER_03]: growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they are parasitic in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they are symbiotic in the form
of helping out plant roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're here at a cannabis conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some of you are growers and you've
used fertilizers and compost that have
[SPEAKER_03]: been inoculated with mycorrhizae fungi
that are supposed to help those plant
[SPEAKER_03]: roots do a slightly better job of mining
the soil for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so fungi grow in all sorts of
different substrates or foods.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can grow in wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes them very special that they can
break down lignin.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the psilocybin mushrooms,
containing mushrooms, of which there are
[SPEAKER_03]: over 200 species, a lot of them are
associated with dung and growing out of
[SPEAKER_03]: cow patties, for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've probably heard that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people go picking in ranchers'
lands and maybe get scared off with a
[SPEAKER_03]: shotgun or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people think that the psilocybin and
psilocin and these psychoactive components
[SPEAKER_03]: are actually an evolutionary trait by the
mushroom to ward off insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insects are very common in, like as a
pattern, passed in the mushroom-growing
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, like fungal gnats are a real big
problem, different types of flies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there have been studies that have
shown that insects that have been fed
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic mushrooms, essentially,
or maybe synthetic psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have a reduced appetite.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those psychoactive components are a
pest deterrent or an antiherbivory
[SPEAKER_03]: compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll just add that this trait or
this gene complex that's responsible for
[SPEAKER_03]: producing these psychoactive components,
like psilocybin and psilocin, they've
[SPEAKER_03]: shown up in all these unrelated mushroom
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned 200.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these mushrooms are not actually very
closely related.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was a paper released a couple
years ago that gets into the perhaps the
[SPEAKER_03]: origin of the extreme number of times that
this popped up in uncommon mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea is positive that perhaps
bacteria are doing horizontal gene
[SPEAKER_03]: transfer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fungi have also been shown to be able to
move these genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the hyphae connect through a
process called plasmagmy and karyagmy,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're sharing genetic material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you find that this trait has been
transferred over to many different
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms because it's evolutionarily
advantageous to improve their fitness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find that simply remarkable that
hereditary genes that are passed down from
[SPEAKER_03]: one generation to generation are not the
only means to which these properties are
[SPEAKER_03]: passed on, are transferred in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Rast and I were talking about
epigenetics, more on the human side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could get a little bit into that
later and how some of these medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: properties have such a long-lasting effect
for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to add, Madison,
I think didn't they talk to those patients
[SPEAKER_03]: like 20 years ago or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Doblin did a follow-up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, do you want to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Rick Doblin followed up with,
oh, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, wait, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, Rick Doblin followed up with
some of the people who were in the Good
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did find some methodological holes
in the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The double-blind nature of it wasn't as
foolproof as double-blind studies are
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to explain what double-blind is,
is neither the subject nor the researcher
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what they're taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that experiment, this placebo was an
active placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was still a little bit of an effect,
so it wouldn't be totally obvious because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all sort of in the same
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had found some holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is that, and Doblin
wrote this, is that the drug-induced
[SPEAKER_00]: mysticism is not inferior to other types
of mysticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea being that you can have a very
legitimate mystical spiritual religious
[SPEAKER_00]: experience from psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, now researchers at Johns
Hopkins and NYU have been going on to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of pick up where the Good Friday
experiment left, and Doblin's follow-up,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was in 1987, left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an ongoing study now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and another researcher,
Charles Grove, who's at UCLA, has talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about the concept of applied mysticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what mushrooms are forcing
scientists to do is to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: shamanic history and sacred and spiritual
uses of psilocybin long before science
[SPEAKER_00]: really, or Western scientists at our
universities here, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's realizing that, and we write
about this in double-blind, is the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between a synthetic psilocybin
experience and actually taking the real
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, which come with other,
probably you can explain what else is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the real mushrooms versus the synthetic
isolate of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot that's lost in synthesis
and in the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of sitting in a room with blindfolds and
two therapists, a man and a woman,
[SPEAKER_00]: for six hours or however long your
experience is versus doing it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: ceremonial environment with a medicine
person or a shaman or whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it with songs and with basically the
cultural technology that humanity has used
[SPEAKER_00]: for centuries that goes along with
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to jump in there and talk
about why it's so important to
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard about the MAPS studies,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually after the clinical trial
process goes through, they've shown
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy for using psilocybin to treat
anxiety, addiction, all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things that will be approved as a
pharmaceutical drug that a doctor will
[SPEAKER_01]: have to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we look at the history of
cannabis, for example, THC was approved in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1985 as Marinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was just approved as a pharmaceutical
drug as Epidiolex for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is cannabis legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, it's still illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So legalizing just an isolated chemical or
active ingredient in these plant-based
[SPEAKER_01]: substances did not actually change the
legality of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important for us to look at
decriminalizing the mushroom itself
[SPEAKER_01]: because again, we want people to be able
to access a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be able to access something
that you can grow safely at home and
[SPEAKER_01]: consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are benefits to using these
substances at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there's benefits to using magic
mushrooms or psilocybin mushrooms at
[SPEAKER_01]: different dosages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked a little bit about mystical
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's sort of a macro dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a very large dose that's intended to
have hallucinogenic properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use psilocybin mushrooms at
micro doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are doses a little bit under half
a gram that might not really produce any
[SPEAKER_01]: type of hallucination or any
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just might feel maybe a little bit
more focused, a little bit more clear,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: For somebody who's in pain with
fibromyalgia, for example, like myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might micro dose to actually distract
you a little bit from the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole bunch of different
reasons why somebody would micro dose and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to get that mystical
experience, but you're still going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's even clinical research
suggesting improving some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's not just placebo, that you can
take small amounts of psilocybin mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also take those macro doses and
there's other purposes and set and setting
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to actually help you get
those benefits out of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very much like THC where you can do
micro dosing where you're not high,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're still getting anxiety relief or
a little bit of pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can take those big doses and feel
great or even have a mystical experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar and I just wanted to
touch on that, that there's many different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to use psilocybin mushrooms and it's
going to be different than just taking,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, a psilocybin pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually segues to a question I
wanted to ask you all about leading to
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there was something else you wanted
to add, Will, before we do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wanted to bring up, I went to an
interesting talk about ketamine
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctors are so afraid of this mystical
experience that they're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribing alongside these legal ketamine
treatments a drug that will deactivate or
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent the mystical experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, you're kind of robbing people of
this healing experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big proponent of the whole plant or
whole mushroom medicine and that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: important sometimes to go through some of
that anxiety or nausea associated that you
[SPEAKER_03]: might have associated with trips on
mushrooms because that's your body telling
[SPEAKER_03]: you to get rid of something and I think
that's equally as important as the
[SPEAKER_03]: euphoria and the feel-good parts of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I do that, actually, I'll ask this
question because it piggybacks off what
[SPEAKER_02]: you all were just speaking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard about the entourage effect in
cannabis today quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any research about whether
whole mushroom versus a synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocybin, whether there's a difference
and are there other compounds besides
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocybin that are active in the
psychedelic component of a mushroom?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really good question because this
is a good parallel between cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: although I would say in my limited
understanding that it's much more complex
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breaks down our dephosphorylates into
psilocin and then there's a breakdown of
[SPEAKER_03]: that into basistin and then there's a
breakdown of that into norbasistin and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think there's many more compounds that
we're still very novice and still haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: really researched and that's part of why
we want to decriminalize mushrooms so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can actually fully carry out this research
but most of the time folks are looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: the ratio between psilocybin and psilocin
and most of the times people are
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivating or talking about cubensies
which are one of the lesser active
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like third out of these like 200 but
I think we've still got like a lot to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the mycelium of these fungi can also
have active components meaning that the
[SPEAKER_03]: mycelium and not just the mushroom have
psilocybin and psilocin and it has a
[SPEAKER_03]: different structure and it's a different
morphology so you could reason to think
[SPEAKER_03]: that it has a different metabolism in your
body as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How exciting is that by the way?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to stress like how many
strains of cannabis there are like
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about all the different cultivars
like over 200 mushrooms that contain
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin we may find out that some are
great for PTSD for example some are great
[SPEAKER_01]: for pain like we are just scratching the
surface on what we know and what we could
[SPEAKER_01]: learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we for those of you who don't know
psilocybin is a schedule one drug so just
[SPEAKER_02]: same as cannabis no accepted use by the by
the federal government so still schedule
[SPEAKER_02]: one and in California we are one of a
handful of states that actually make it a
[SPEAKER_02]: crime to possess the spores of a
psychedelic mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Idaho and Georgia being the other two.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go we're in great company there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leads to my next question okay so
I came to learn when I was getting ready
[SPEAKER_02]: for this talk that there is a bit of a
debate among learned people in this area
[SPEAKER_02]: about whether policy reform should give
way to scientific research and we should
[SPEAKER_02]: wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's definitely some holdover
from Timothy Leary in the 70s there's
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely a there was a feeling in the
scientific community that that really set
[SPEAKER_02]: things back in a major way whether you
believe that or not or whether that's
[SPEAKER_02]: factually accurate but it is the case that
that folks do kind of have this there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of a debate about whether we
should not legalize should not
[SPEAKER_02]: decriminalize so that we can let science
scientists do their work and then we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: come to it later once we have more
information as opposed to folks who say no
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to decriminalize because one is
just about fundamental freedom but second
[SPEAKER_02]: that really it supports the kind of
research that we actually need to do and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe that leads to the idea of whole
mushroom as opposed to just a synthetic or
[SPEAKER_02]: a or an isolate of a certain compound and
how it might also how legalization might
[SPEAKER_02]: relate to the actual experience that that
folks would have when they are on it so
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever wants to take it first what do you
what say you about legalization versus
[SPEAKER_01]: policy reform you know yeah you got it you
know as a scientist it's sort of funny I
[SPEAKER_01]: never really thought I would get involved
in drug policy reform we're supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: get you know not play in politics
especially when the government is the one
[SPEAKER_01]: funding or not funding your research right
it took me actually leaving academia to
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually founding my own nonprofit and
working with groups like drug policy
[SPEAKER_01]: alliance to actually have the voice to
make change and so when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists not being you shouldn't be
getting involved in drug reform well the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that these substances are federally
illegal actually does hamper research for
[SPEAKER_01]: example if you have patients that with
anxiety depression for example that might
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from consuming psilocybin
mushrooms but are scared of getting them
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're illegal right they're
scared of losing their children losing
[SPEAKER_01]: their job getting drug tested whatever it
is they're not going to participate even
[SPEAKER_01]: in an observational study right even if
it's just an app that's saying hey tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of mushroom you took how much
you did it what you did how it felt like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe record your trip not everyone is
going to be open to doing that and so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard for us to collect data when it
is still schedule one drug and there are
[SPEAKER_01]: state and federal penalties associated
with it we saw this in states where
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis was illegal you know if you were
fearful about going to jail if you
[SPEAKER_01]: reported your use you weren't going to
fill out that app you weren't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in that research study you
were really scared and I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization will help improve our ability
to do some of the research again we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have to go in baby steps right
California first states first and then
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully federal level will change at
some point but it will help destigmatize
[SPEAKER_01]: the use and also destigmatize the research
around it and I think that research is a
[SPEAKER_01]: really big part of decriminalized
California we want to learn how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: helping people we want to learn if it's
safe or not safe for certain groups what
[SPEAKER_01]: the research shows us right now is that
it's pretty safe we want to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: practice harm reduction rather than saying
wait we need more research there's already
[SPEAKER_01]: over 30 clinical trials on clinicaltrial
.gov on psilocybin you can see all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different studies out there it's been
researched it can be researched more but
[SPEAKER_01]: we cannot accept things like you know our
government saying there's not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: research on cannabis that's why it's still
schedule one you know how many more
[SPEAKER_01]: studies would do we need it's sort of this
limiting fear based approach to you know
[SPEAKER_01]: drug reform policy rather than saying hey
you know we have veterans dying we have
[SPEAKER_01]: people dying from depression right through
suicide 25 percent of people with
[SPEAKER_01]: depression are treatment resistant that
means no pharmaceutical or other treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to dent their depression are we
going to wait for them to commit suicide
[SPEAKER_01]: are we going to allow them compassionate
access to a again a fungus that grows from
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground that could be beneficial for
their depression you know as a scientist
[SPEAKER_01]: in me I hope and there's other scientists
here that you feel compelled to go with
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart to change laws to participate
in this research and again moral
[SPEAKER_01]: obligation to change really bad drug laws
in this state and in this country
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you might say that okay well you
want to go next sure yeah that was amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: fully you know agree with everything
you're saying I actually started off as a
[SPEAKER_03]: poly side major in college I'm so glad I
didn't but I'm also so glad I am sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: up here with these professionals talking
about drug reform one thing that I just
[SPEAKER_03]: want to vibe off of from this conference
thinking about the talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mississippi like dirt weed you know what I
think of and there's this controversy
[SPEAKER_03]: right now happening with this organization
called compass and there's this real fear
[SPEAKER_03]: that they are creating this monopoly on
synthetic psilocybin and so by keeping it
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal you're able to consolidate that
power and money into a small group of
[SPEAKER_03]: people when we're talking about something
that has been used traditionally
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the world I would add this is a
global you know a phenomenon by you know
[SPEAKER_03]: in tradition for thousands of years and
and at the end of the day for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: therapeutic medicinal and spiritual
benefits and bandages I'm of the mind I
[SPEAKER_03]: think as with many people in this room
that it's it's a problem with the
[SPEAKER_03]: government telling us what we can and
can't do with our bodies and I have a big
[SPEAKER_03]: problem with that and think that should
change immediately as a journalist I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: really supposed to take an official
opinion on this as a human being I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think anyone should be in jail for a plant
or a fungus and so automatically I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: in decriminalization and to your point I
mean one thing is that the FDA approved
[SPEAKER_00]: trials that's going to pharmaceuticalize
these substances in a synthetic format
[SPEAKER_00]: which would mean legally then taking a
whole mushroom doesn't mean the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: as taking a synthetic pill or capsule of
psilocybin and that's just false so one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I'm worried about and I wrote
about this also in double-blind is what
[SPEAKER_00]: can the up-and-coming psychedelic industry
learn from cannabis one thing is compass
[SPEAKER_00]: again does pose a serious concern about a
monopoly on pharmaceuticalized psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: and also whether it's compass or some
other company the idea I mean there are
[SPEAKER_00]: still going to be questions of
accessibility access affordability whether
[SPEAKER_00]: this will be covered by insurance and
stuff like that which will make it so that
[SPEAKER_00]: most people not most people but a certain
class of people are able to access
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic assisted psychotherapy and
everyone else is still going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: risk their legal freedoms to get the same
benefits or not even the same benefits one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I also want to note is that there's
a lot of enthusiasm around this and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the benefits that people are getting
from psychedelic psychedelic assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: psychotherapy is happening specifically in
that context of psychedelic assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: psychotherapy not necessarily like out
with your friends or at a party or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever sometimes you are going to have
an amazing chance for transformative
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in an unregulated or unclinical
setting but the results that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: are only specifically in those clinical
settings so in order to whether or not you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the majority of these psychedelic so
there's MDMA or psilocybin and so forth
[SPEAKER_00]: are available through the
pharmaceuticalized model or through
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization I think that's something
that right now psychedelic industry people
[SPEAKER_00]: and advocates and activists and scientists
are going to have to ask themselves as we
[SPEAKER_00]: go forward and vote for decriminalize
California and everything else awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you okay so we have we have just a
few minutes left so I want to do a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a lightning round I have a couple
questions I want to ask each of the each
[SPEAKER_02]: of the other folks up here Madison we'll
start with you since we've started down at
[SPEAKER_02]: the other end so can you share what a book
or a study or an article or a song or a
[SPEAKER_02]: poem or a finding or something that you
would like to share that will spark
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity yeah so I one thing is that when
we talk about psychedelics we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the wellness of the individual and the
wellness of the collective and the good
[SPEAKER_00]: and I or the the good of kind of everybody
at large and so I think that psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: have the power not just to transform a
person but then to transform the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: vote or the way that they are a political
citizen in wherever they are and wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: they're living so there's one study that
Natalie Ginsburg from maps the
[SPEAKER_00]: multidisciplinary Association for
psychedelic studies is doing which is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at ayahuasca in conflict
resolution between Israelis and
[SPEAKER_00]: Palestinians yeah so I I think that
whether or not not everyone in a conflict
[SPEAKER_00]: zone is going to have access to
psychedelics but I think as we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply psychedelic principles and ethos to
the way that we approach policies and
[SPEAKER_00]: politics and the way we vote that's really
gonna transform the current paradigm thank
[SPEAKER_03]: you well yeah I'm inspired by the work of
Paul Stamets he wrote yeah a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: fans in the audience very good yeah he
wrote the psilocybin mushrooms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world I believe in the 90s oh yeah so
Stamets book psilocybin mushrooms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world one study I mean there's there's
starting to be so many studies where you
[SPEAKER_03]: mention like 30 or something on psilocybin
just something personally I have a brother
[SPEAKER_03]: with he's on the autism spectrum and
they're looking at anxiety you know
[SPEAKER_03]: reducing social anxiety in people with
with with autism I'm like I would never
[SPEAKER_03]: have thought like my brother should be a
microdosing but like yeah maybe he should
[SPEAKER_03]: you know so it's challenging like even my
kind of narrower view of psychedelics
[SPEAKER_03]: which I think as a society we're all going
to be doing or all we are doing right now
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe in the power of
psilocybin mushrooms to heal the world
[SPEAKER_01]: we're sort of in a bad place right now
right there are two studies in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: that show the power of magic mushrooms to
heal some of our social ills one is the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that taking psilocybin mushrooms not
in a clinical setting not as a psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: capsule just any point it could have even
been at a concert you went to right just
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming psilocybin mushrooms at least
once in your life reduces your risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: overdosing on opioids so you're going to
make some better choices in life somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: it's happening I can't tell you the
mechanism for that but you have a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: risk secondly we talk about domestic
violence in this country and also trauma
[SPEAKER_01]: that women have to endure every day you
know we talked about the me too movement
[SPEAKER_01]: like things like that there's a lot of
stuff women go through and if we could
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce domestic violence we were to reduce
trauma being handed down from generation
[SPEAKER_01]: to generation there is a study that shows
consuming psilocybin mushrooms reduces
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic violence and reduces violence in
general so again healing the world through
[SPEAKER_01]: less violence more love what more can we
ask this mushroom for right okay
[SPEAKER_02]: last question rather than take questions
because everybody wants a drink and some
[SPEAKER_02]: food and you can come ask these folks
questions afterwards I'm gonna have each
[SPEAKER_02]: of them give you a question to take away
okay so we didn't we didn't actually ask
[SPEAKER_01]: how many people even consumed psilocybin
mushrooms here either at macro doses or
[SPEAKER_01]: micro doses but what I want you to do is
take if you are new to this learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: this tell somebody about this and I want
to recommend a website that has great
[SPEAKER_01]: information on psychedelics in general and
their benefits risks implication for
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing etc it's called drugs over
dinner org hosted dinner party let's talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about psilocybin maybe your mom has done
it you know like let's normalize the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about psilocybin mushrooms in
the same way that we did with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: you might find that more people are open
to it than you thought I mean we are
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much in Los Angeles but not in
other cities around the world let's start
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation please spark that
conversation okay yeah I've had a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts about this and just purely as a
as a mycologist thinking about how
[SPEAKER_03]: mycology has a role in the work that you
do whether that's if you're a grower if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a pest that's a problem like powdery
mildew or the mycorrhizae that are helping
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants roots or in remediation of the
soil I I think we all need to open our
[SPEAKER_03]: minds to all the uses of mycology in our
lives psychedelic non-psychedelic and just
[SPEAKER_03]: bring bring forth this conversation
excellent thank you Madison so you're I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna guess a lot of you are in the
cannabis space ask yourself how you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: about the regulations and the way the
cannabis industry looks right now and then
[SPEAKER_00]: ask yourself if that's what you want for
psilocybin great question great question
[SPEAKER_02]: okay okay thank you all so much thank the
three of you just amazing I want to leave
[SPEAKER_02]: you with one thought this is my little
personal touch here I just want to read a
[SPEAKER_02]: short poem to you that speaks to my
experience with with psilocybin it's by
[SPEAKER_02]: lol dead who was a 14th century Kashmiri
saint and and poet I was passionate filled
[SPEAKER_02]: with longing I searched far and wide but
the day that the truthful one found me I
[SPEAKER_02]: was at home enjoy your evening
