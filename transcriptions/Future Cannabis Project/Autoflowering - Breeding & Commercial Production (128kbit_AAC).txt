[SPEAKER_00]: What are you seeing as far as the
advantages for auto flowers for folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing at a scaled level at acreage
size?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I would say since this is going
to be on the internet forever,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is for posterity, go back and take a
look if you're very interested about
[SPEAKER_01]: geeking out on some of the historical
background on ruderalis, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: technical term for auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis is Latin for, derived from
ruderal, which is rubble, from the rubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are plants that can grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow where it freezes,
they can grow through frost, they can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in very, very crazy situations and
actually finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick at industrial scale is really
being able to get them in the ground at
[SPEAKER_01]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that's a direct seeding or
transplanting before the plant goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through stress, there's some underlying
genetic mechanisms that lead the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: go directly into flower when it senses a
stressful situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to step back for a second,
because of that posterity sake,
[SPEAKER_01]: take a look for that geek out moment at
Ernie Smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie Smalls is a Canadian researcher
who's been working on cannabis related
[SPEAKER_01]: issues for the last 45 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the person that was responsible for
coming up for the industrial hemp 0.3 THC
[SPEAKER_01]: rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back and look at his earlier
writings, it was based on taking a leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: off at the top of the plant rather than
testing the top eight inches of flower at
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, that's going to be incorporated
into the USDA rules as they move forward
[SPEAKER_01]: with the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, he wrote a seminal paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that this is going to go down as
one of those testaments to auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: The paper is about highlighting the fact
that these day neutral auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants represent really the peak in human
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of other crops, the reasons and
rationales that we have for expanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: total productivity of each individual crop
on a per acre basis has come down to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders, geneticists, et cetera,
over long periods of time, being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the plants more compact, make them
more uniform, and take wild types of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that tend to have seeds in varying
places on the plant and consolidate them
[SPEAKER_01]: into a usable machine, harvestable,
really energy dense organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been true for many of the other
crops that have been domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie Smalls goes so far as to say that
that is the most profound thing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen in over 13,000 years of human
agriculture is this move towards... He
[SPEAKER_01]: calls them semi dwarf or dwarf germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of the paper is Dwarf Germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, it's about how to get
tremendously large yields both for food
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, if you're growing for seed,
hopefully in places where they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for senesemia or cannabinoid
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into that later, but also for
cannabinoid production in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about being able to maximize the
space, minimize the inputs, and really
[SPEAKER_01]: allow both farmers and people who benefit
from these compounds to have more access
[SPEAKER_01]: to them and to benefit from this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowering plants are tremendous at
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we ought to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants, if you're not familiar with
auto flowers, two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, they'll start to flower in
18 days up to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just flower, period, which is
pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the other thing about them is that
they that you can overdo it with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plant that grew quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were discovered in about 1900,
1903.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scientists found them in the Volga River
area in Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: He described it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had low THC or no THC, and so they
basically forgot about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in the 70s, people started to say,
hmm, maybe we could breed these.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breeding happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in 2003, a guy was able to
successfully commercialize one called
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowrider.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the ultimate heirloom kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not a land race really,
I don't think anymore, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: heirloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can breed these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go flower in 18 days, third week.
[SPEAKER_02]: By nine weeks, they're finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: You harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, the breeding potential and
opportunities on these things are just
[SPEAKER_02]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunity to be able to improve on
this plant, like we have in theory
[SPEAKER_02]: improved on some of our agricultural
plants, is absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I love about them is
that if you have got a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but you really want to
supplement with light for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually do two cycles of auto
flowers without light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experimenting with that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing I ran into was trying to
keep them warm, because auto flowers don't
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly like to start off their life
with cold feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is you can start something early
spring and have it finish 4th of July and
[SPEAKER_00]: then put seeds in that same no-till
environment, let those pop, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: done by October 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've run two cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pull any tar,
which we all love to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to hit on was how
appropriate these are for patients and for
[SPEAKER_00]: people with lower mobility, because like
Jeff mentioned, these are very compact
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pretty much top out at around three,
three and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, you don't have to do the
reaching, and they're not hard to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient can stand up and look all
around them for mold instead of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with some of these nine footers,
where they're just impossible to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're beautiful, and I love them,
and I want to toke them, but they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: caged and difficult to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that folks who are
living in an apartment, who are growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: a tent, can grow four of these together
with no sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need to scrawl them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're a patient, they're so easy
to use and always going to flower in a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really opens up the door,
but let's not leave the impression that
[SPEAKER_02]: these are little teeny baby flowers
because they're little teeny plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen colas that are 80 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable, and they'll have 10 of these
colas on a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not the lowrider that you
remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are a totally new plant,
ready for prime time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to add on to that, yes, you can make
them flower in general for field
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at about 77 days from the
time that the seed emerges in a starter
[SPEAKER_01]: plug, transplanted into the field within
the week, 77 days from that time of
[SPEAKER_01]: emergence until we harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Jeff is saying is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see with regular photoperiod
plants is the stem and stock weight
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts for about 27.5% of the total
biomass of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these day neutral plants,
you're looking at roughly 19%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about a significant percentage of
increased biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that I will say,
and it's a little bit of a brain bubble,
[SPEAKER_01]: is try growing one of these in a 100
gallon smart pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice for patients or someone
who's just trying to experiment with one
[SPEAKER_01]: of these plants in a three gallon
container to have it on their deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very useful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stay small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to flip out if you hit
them with a porch light in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the night when you go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put one in a much bigger container,
you're going to notice that the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: system is genetically determined based on
stress, and stress particularly to the
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually grow five, six,
seven, eight, nine foot tall auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering plants if they have enough root
space and they're not restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we think about cannabis, one of the
things that researchers always go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: is the amazing plasticity of that plant
and its ability to respond to the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that it's placed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowering plants, these day neutrals
are, to me, it's the epitome of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pull together something Jeff
just said and something you just said and
[SPEAKER_00]: take it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff loves to talk about how these scrappy
little plants from Russia, you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in rocky crappy soil and they still
very much thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have spoken to me before, just like
you just did to all of us, that the stress
[SPEAKER_00]: of the roots hitting the bottom of the
pot, that's going to trigger flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard you give this example
before of these large hundred gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes me very interested in growing
an eight foot auto flower just to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they grow in soil then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you go right into the ground,
but there's no eventual bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has got to be something going on
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the trigger?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many, many different soil
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Willamette Valley, we're blessed
with a number of things, including we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get into this as we talk about farming at
scale, but we have in certain locations 38
[SPEAKER_01]: feet of topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's properly prepared, you can end up
with very large plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had plants that were averaging a pound
and a half per plant planted very densely
[SPEAKER_01]: in the field just north of the Corvallis
last summer for one of our R&D trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really comes down to proper soil
preparation and the ability for those
[SPEAKER_01]: roots to just go out and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at different plants from a
breeding perspective, what we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do is we need photo period
plants for very particular locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need plants that are going to flower
early, but are still photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need auto flowering plants so that you
can deploy these plants in basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: once you've developed a particular chemo
bar, you can deploy them anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what makes these different
compounds available to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having CBD varieties, having CBG
varieties, CBC rich plants, more
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly now working on CBDV,
CBGV, and CBCV, along with other minor
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that we don't even know how to
quantify and don't have reference
[SPEAKER_01]: standards for.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just from a patient perspective,
being able to grow it at home and take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of your own family or take care of
yourself, through the joy of actually
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening a plant, there's something
emancipatory about being able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody feels that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to make sure that those
compounds are available at scale at a
[SPEAKER_01]: price that individuals can actually afford
to treat themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants make that possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: One good example of that is being able to
use the plasticity of auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for a particular ecological niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people here are probably familiar
with how much grass seeds the Willamette
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Willamette Valley is home to 95% of
the world's grass seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to grow grass seed in the
Willamette Valley for better or for worse
[SPEAKER_01]: due to the climate that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't normally get rain in the
Willamette Valley through the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: July up until the middle of August.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a month of, generally speaking,
very, very dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows a competitive advantage of grass
seed farmers who have good irrigation and
[SPEAKER_01]: great soil to be able to grow this
particular crop, cut it down, field dry
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it sits in the field for five to seven
days, and then it gets combined and picked
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other place in the world has that
steady climate that allows for that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, even though most people like
food rather than lawns, but no one else is
[SPEAKER_01]: able to really do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually do the same thing and use
this ecological advantage paired with a
[SPEAKER_01]: technological and horticultural advantage
by using these auto flowering plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant thousands of acres of very rare and
useful compounds that are present in these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants after specific breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow them out and dry them in a way that
doesn't require a huge drying
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure that you would have to have
for other crops or in other locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge, I think it's a huge step
forward in terms of being able to make
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds available, make them an
everyday thing so that you can literally
[SPEAKER_01]: walk into any supermarket and find
something that is useful in targeting a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular malady.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to figure out exactly what
those compounds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two follow up questions for you,
Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, I hear from a lot of
folks when I, I've become kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: evangelist for auto flowers because I'm so
into them, but people come up to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, we don't want auto flowers
because we can't breed with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not for everybody and I want my
nine foot plants and you already dispelled
[SPEAKER_00]: the short plants thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know they were taller,
but I like that you just said that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are particular nature environments where
you want the photo period, some that are
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period, but finish early and then
there's auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not heard that analysis before,
so will you go a little more in depth in
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we still need the other two
categories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's nice to have diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do, we do need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we need them to breed with because
the land race strains are photo period and
[SPEAKER_02]: so we need those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, we need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good example is when we're, this is
something that a lot of us living in a
[SPEAKER_01]: black market, it was difficult to be able
to get information about the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: people produce in other areas of the
country or other areas of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great example is Kentucky and Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kentucky and Tennessee have incredibly
wet July, August, and September's and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the very end of September and
then through October they have perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like what Oregon is like in
late August, early September.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the rains hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as most of us know, here we need to
make sure that our plants are out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, taken care of, harvested,
dried, properly handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not done by the middle of
September, you're really pushing yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really chancing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those areas, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to actually get your plants out
at the end of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, a long season,
a full season photo period sensitive plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is really the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if you have an auto flowering
plant in certain areas, you can plant your
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers in early May, go back and
replant in mid July and end up getting two
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and basically double the
productivity of what you have available to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that they are a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: From a breeding perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we make feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can come to me with a good
argument as to what is actually contained
[SPEAKER_01]: in the male genome that's useful and how
you can access and figure out what those
[SPEAKER_01]: traits are, I'm open to having my mind
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what science is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that we operate is that we
make feminized seed and we use females
[SPEAKER_01]: because it allows us to know what the
chemo type is, to know what the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles are, to know what the potency is,
the flower structure, and then be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how that's inherited from
generation to generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowering plants are a different
animal in the sense that when you plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that seed, that clock is ticking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just go, oh, hey, that's a great
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just re-veget and get some cuttings
off of it and use it for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great example of this, last year I was
working through, had about 20 different
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG rich plants trying to figure out what
the average ratio of CBG to THC was to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify which plants we could use or at
least what the frequency was for
[SPEAKER_01]: developing really, really high ratio
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the individuals from that
population, we sent the results into a
[SPEAKER_01]: third party lab after we tried to screen
them in-house, and they came back and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, whoa, 50% of your total cannabinoid
profile was a compound that we've never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a cannabinoid from its
molecular weight, but we don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: reference standards to be able to identify
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Pixis in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a very good lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have more cannabinoids available to
them than most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This lab's in the country, and very good
equipment, very well-trained personnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person I was interacting with said,
can you send me another sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tearing my hair out saying,
that was the only plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go back and grow hundreds of those
plants out, and you never find that same
[SPEAKER_01]: plant again.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a structured breeding program,
when you're trying to isolate these
[SPEAKER_01]: individual compounds and turn them into
useful field-ready or home-grower-ready
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, it poses a significant challenge
because you only have a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have literal professionals now working
at our company who are trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: other ways of making this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a significant technological
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways around it, but it takes a ton
of space, a ton of time, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: motivation to really be able to isolate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a different animal when it comes
to the breeding standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from a professional perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a real amateur perspective,
if you take two auto-flowering plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: breed them together, you can breed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine weeks, holy crow, and all of a
sudden, I think I'll name this after my
[SPEAKER_02]: wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the big guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fun, and the idea that you can
get somebody's genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They talk about genetics at this
conference here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, folks, just a little side joke
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get somebody's great genetics,
and you say, gee, I wonder if as an
[SPEAKER_02]: amateur, can I fool around with this stuff
a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're not as exact as these guys,
obviously, but you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fool around with it, and you can
do it all winter long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under 20 hours of light, you can do it all
night long.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fun, fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it can be difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can cause some problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a professional grower,
you've got to adjust yourself a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But boy, if you are a professional grower
and you're growing medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: get into these auto-flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if we can improve the ability to get
more medicine out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really important point,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up the historical reference
back to the lowrider varieties from 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a shitty plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew some of that, and it just made me
sick to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene profile was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure was not great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could see the promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see the promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it took was small-time breeders
who were working under either medical
[SPEAKER_01]: programs or in their garage,
surreptitiously, to improve those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until 2010 that I finally
consumed something that changed my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: about auto-flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had taken one of DJ Short's
blueberry varieties, Mircein dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a number of different minor terpene
that end up making it a very calm
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-anxiety experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful piece of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they finally instilled that into an
auto-flowering plant that made the effect
[SPEAKER_01]: and the flavor just as good or better than
a lot of the other commercially available
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the... No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The early ones were interesting,
but they weren't any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember there's a listserv called
autoflowering.net.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we kid about.
[SPEAKER_02]: They threw me off, because I got on it and
I said, gee, I'm writing this book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they threw me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I finally, thanks to Shango,
got back on again, and Ted has... But when
[SPEAKER_02]: they first started, and you would be on
Grass City or one of those other forums,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you say, oh, I'm growing auto-flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made fun of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you were drummed out of the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody started the autonet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go back the way...
[SPEAKER_02]: People were just struggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And around 2008, 2009, somewhere right in
that area, they hit the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they started laughing at other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pictures, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on Instagram, just yesterday,
I saw one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had one of these movies where it
went from seed to harvest in two seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you folks, get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are going to love these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to buy feminized seeds for my
own home growing and to help patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because being able to take males out of
the mix, if you're not breeding them,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, there are still lots of
auto-flower seeds that are being sold
[SPEAKER_00]: regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just want the flowers and
you don't want to play with the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Jeff is suggesting, get yourself some
fantastic, modern, feminized seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mephisto Genetics or somebody who's got a
good reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all very plug and play,
just like Jeff is describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to enjoy that extra
horticulture experience of making
[SPEAKER_00]: something that did not exist in the world
until you did it, find yourself a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: auto-flower reg seeds and pop a couple of
them that you think sound interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really easy to collect male
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a branch and put it in a bag and
you shake it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a bag of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you walk to the other side,
or maybe your friend's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put some of that pollen on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you paint it onto one branch of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're done, next year
you're going to have 40 or 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you get to name it,
which can be the most fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to wait till next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things grow indoors really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Anchorage, we're really excited about
the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunity to grow these things
because we get a photo period the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time we get the frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this is going to just change our
whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So auto-flowers, as you just heard from
talking about the lowrider, old Keemabar,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people nowadays still consider
them cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But professionals are like, man,
this is just something on the side that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to matter to the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you meet Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you walk acre upon acre of these
beautiful plants in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the air is filled with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just like, oh my gosh,
I want to lay up my tent and just live
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'd like to hear from you both
are commercial applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, let's talk about yield
and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's one thing that it's all
incredibly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can grow them in tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people are thinking about
scale for commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, am I going to get enough flour
for my effort for home growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like you both to speak to that
option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here in Oregon, I would start with
new breed seeds, frankly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the first ones to get their
license to be able to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are growing for commercial
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last time I spoke to them,
they said, yeah, they're selling the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a pee in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want to go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are lots of commercial growers
that are using these things for a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of reasons, all the ones we've already
discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing indoors on racks,
if you get the right size plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: double racks, triple racks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the whole ceiling,
all the way up to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: The space on these things make it so that
you can interspace them in between
[SPEAKER_02]: existing plants, which is really a useful
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already got the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already got the light if you're
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to interspace a little
small plant that's not going to detract
[SPEAKER_02]: from the bigger plants that you're trying
to grow, it doubles your ability to get
[SPEAKER_02]: more income as a result of doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that regard, it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the idea that you can
get something in seven, nine, if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go longer, 12 weeks, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, from a commercial perspective,
if the yield is good and the power is
[SPEAKER_02]: good, if that's the terpene spectrum,
you're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to grow anything but?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really highly encourage you to try
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really quite something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to contact people like New Breeze
Seeds and get names of other commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders that are doing it, go see what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all share information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm glad you reminded me of that,
too, before you answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to plug with the correct URL,
autoflower.net, because Jeff's story was
[SPEAKER_00]: spot on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the people who were laughed off
of other forums for using autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they decided to create their own,
where they could be misfit toys together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we've lost
in our scene, I think, as people have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten more money focused, is everybody's
got IP now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wants to hide and protect
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, outside of just not
wanting to go to jail, people were really
[SPEAKER_00]: open to sharing within the community,
sharing best practices, swapping seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this kind of stuff, which you're
seeing less on the commercial side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're still seeing on this group at
autoflower.net because they are all trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sharing best practices because
they haven't mattered for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really excites me to see some of
the leaders in that particular community
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what things are going to be like
in three or four years when autoflowers
[SPEAKER_00]: just fall off people's lips so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people will be the new
generation of superstars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool when people who,
I love an underdog story, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have some of the best bud porn I
have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the photos are just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Seth, going back to you, specifically,
the people that you are sowing seed to are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at acreage size, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people are, I mean, you don't
have to give people pitches about your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds anymore, but just for the sake of
this conversation, what does that pitch
[SPEAKER_00]: sound like when they're all like,
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to plant a whole field of
these, what are essentially still probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be smaller plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute, what's the name of the
company again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we don't advertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe you like five emails, so we can't
handle the advertising right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, we don't pitch it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People come to us and say, hey,
I really want to try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we say, no, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taken us, it took us three years to
figure out how to get the plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field without having flowering in trays
and actually getting a good yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we're moving on to large scale
field trials for different density of
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've stepped back and we're actually
putting it into the hands of much more
[SPEAKER_01]: competent farmers who've been farming
other crops for their entire lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's such a technical question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different kinds of plants,
roughly?
[SPEAKER_01]: One.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of different varieties
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it's not about cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours are chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at plants as having very
particular chemical compounds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: replicable generation after generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it comes down to trying to
figure out how you, in the same way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're describing maximizing space in a
small area inside, this is how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize the productivity on a per acre
basis over thousands of acres?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really comes down to what we've
seen with successful farmers is either
[SPEAKER_01]: direct seeding, which is rot with all
kinds of problems that most of you
[SPEAKER_01]: probably don't care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it all comes down to the depth of the
planting of the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking about literally
millimeters will make or break success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other side of it is the
density of planting for both weed
[SPEAKER_01]: suppression and to minimize lateral
branching and force the plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: basically just turn into one solid flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what we're looking at this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would say for 2020,
yeah, definitely, we'll be ready for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy auto flowering seeds, both type 3
CBD rich plants and type 4 pure CBG lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the other advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means clearly the short cycle is great
for scaled agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I visited your farm, you were
mentioning some other things like the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants are uniform, so they're
really easy to repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut on a sled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut on a sled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the traditional farming
advantages of this plant versus the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: The main one, and again, it's going to
depend on your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: In certain areas, you can't cut the plant
down and let it dry in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people have had questions
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our team did some amazing experiments this
last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long hours in the field, very hot
conditions, harvesting about 15 acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was about 38,000 plants in
early August.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cutting them down, laying them down in the
field to basically cook at 100 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then grind them up and put them into
totes just to see how much CBD would be
[SPEAKER_01]: lost and what the terpene loss was going
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was about, you're going
to lose about two thirds of your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They vaporize.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still enough to be able to get
some efficacy from entourage effect
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the type of terpenes that
you're working with and their volatility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heavier sesquiterpenes tend to stick
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The really volatile monoterpenes are
always going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the moral of the story on that was
that CBD content did not change.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no statistical difference
between plants that were cut down and
[SPEAKER_01]: dried in the field versus plants that were
cut down and hung up in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's a great thing if you
happen to have a very dry late July,
[SPEAKER_01]: early August.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a rainy period,
that may not necessarily be the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really about, like any farming or
any cannabis production, it's about being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use the plasticity of the plant to
adapt to your own local ecosystem and
[SPEAKER_01]: climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: 65% to 70% of them are myrcine dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're seeing, it was fun to walk
through and take a look at the flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: that were entered for the competition this
year and see the different terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles and watch the evolution of what
growers and breeders are targeting at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go through and count how many are myrcine
dominant this year compared to years past
[SPEAKER_01]: versus terpenaline dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your fuel flavor, your diesel flavor,
terpenaline, beta-karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha-pinene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing that now emerge in
auto-flowering plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit more difficult with
auto-flowering plants just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding that we were talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they definitely pack all of the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be perfectly honest, the potency as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of our type 4 high CBG varieties that
we've developed, the individual plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: has far and away had the highest overall
CBG percentage was an auto-flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came in at almost 16% CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was over 17% CBGA before decarbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely possible to create
absolutely terpene-rich,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid-heavy, and diverse chemotypes
with these day-neutral plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you're heavy in the
analytics, and you test everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do their numbers come out comparable to
photosensitive plants as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: On average, they tend to be a little bit
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also depends on the way that you
treat them in the light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they also have a little bit more
CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can change any of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, from an amateur grower,
it seems to me that there's always CBD in
[SPEAKER_02]: my auto-flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure there is in my bigger
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we haven't seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBC, there is a little bit more CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least there tends to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually depends on the varieties
that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is definitely present in
auto-flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dispel another rumor about taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you spend a lot of time
breeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people say, OK, so this is a
cookie's auto-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, that means that's cookies
crossed with a ruteralis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people say that rutarute
plants taste like crap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you have to say about people
saying that there's all this ruteralis
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes coming along for the ride?
[SPEAKER_01]: There used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that used to be a valid
distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main things to consider as well
is normally what you're trying to do in a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding program is look at the F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take two parents that are very
divergent, cross them, and then do either
[SPEAKER_01]: an open pollination or a targeted selfing
in the F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have F2 plants that exhibit
every possible combination or permutation
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where the most diversity is
expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a plant breeder, that's where
you should be looking for amazing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a specific terpene profile
that you're trying to target, you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: overlook that F1 cross, because that's
actually where you would identify the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that have the most similar profiles
to whatever it is that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: target.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I won't say very easily,
but you could take a GG4 and cross it to
[SPEAKER_01]: an auto-flowering plant, and then do your
initial selection in that F1 in breed it
[SPEAKER_01]: one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can lock those terpene profiles
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It obviously takes more time for
stabilization of traits and that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But terpenes and making it taste good,
we can do that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
