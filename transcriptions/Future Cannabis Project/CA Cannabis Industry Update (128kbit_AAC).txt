[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a quick update on
what is happening out there in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who know, Jonathan
Svetko and Angeles Emeralds have been
[SPEAKER_00]: working really, really hard on the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put in a fantastic working group
together of people from all sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: table, and they spent, I don't know,
something like eight weeks and five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six hours a day really, really breaking
this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made an incredible, incredible
recommendation to the board of
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that those recommendations are really
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to say, there are some parts of
it that people aren't going to agree with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are some great parts of it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to hopefully,
hopefully see some good stuff come from
[SPEAKER_00]: the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: The not good stuff is going to happen too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you a quick idea of what's
happening in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to, expected right now,
they're expected to vote on these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations December 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that they're waiting so long is
because they're not really going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of applications for licenses
until like July, June or July of next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are in unincorporated parts of
LA County, your application process is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start somewhere around December,
January, and you're looking at licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere around summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as opposed to the cities which are
moving a little bit quicker and are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start taking applications, some of
them, as soon as some of them now are
[SPEAKER_00]: taking applications, the county is going
to hold off for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of that unincorporated LA County,
that stuff's going to hold off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep tabs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what's going on,
reach out, look up Angeles Emeralds
[SPEAKER_00]: online, and you can get in contact and get
up on their newsletter mailing list and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything to find out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angeles Emeralds, like Los Angeles and
then Emerald like the green, the other
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and one good thing about the county,
there has been a recommendation that was
[SPEAKER_00]: passed for a pathway for existing
operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So should you or any of your clients or
contacts or friends have, that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: operating, you know, as legal as you can
in LA County unincorporated, there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: a pathway for them to get to applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, LA City.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA City has issued a whole bunch of
regulations, and they're just in
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Thursday, the 21st, is a Planning
Commission meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about it,
go online and look up LA Cannabis Task
[SPEAKER_00]: Force.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find as much information as you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will send you out email notices,
and you can go and, you know, participate
[SPEAKER_00]: and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is LA City.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the short story of LA City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we are right now, West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: West Hollywood, people like Rob,
myself, we've been working very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard in the city of West Hollywood to
get them to, you know, create some really
[SPEAKER_00]: good policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've done quite an excellent
job, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to have some
incredible policy here in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see onsite consumption
lounges, actual individual lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see onsite consumption for
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see infusion places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to have a, I'm making this
up, if you want to have a cupcake place,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to have a commercial kitchen
in the back and infuse, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be able to do your extractions
here, probably, but you can certainly do
[SPEAKER_00]: your infusions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this city is going to probably have
some really, really forward-thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis policy, where the ordinance
itself, the draft will be read in early
[SPEAKER_00]: November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we got a couple months
before we actually have that, but we
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much know what's going to be in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to congratulate the city of
West Hollywood for doing really an
excellent job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully leading California in great
policy.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, how is West Hollywood
addressing social lounges as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in regards to the state, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the simple answer to that is the state
is not going to issue onsite consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will adhere to it, but they're not
actually, there's no license you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: from the state for onsite consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to get that from your city
if your city issues them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it relates to, it's twofold,
Joel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's standalone consumption lounges,
like this is a bar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Standalone bar would be like this,
except no alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way to do it is if this place,
as an example, was able to apply for a
[SPEAKER_00]: retail license, excuse me, a consumption
license, and somehow worked it out with
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol Beverage Commission, with ABC,
that's going to be the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the city is going to have
a lot to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is going to come and take a look
at who wants licenses, if it's a hotel,
[SPEAKER_00]: bar, spa, yoga studio, restaurant,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're going to see that first
in this city, and hopefully they'll set
[SPEAKER_00]: some good standards for the rest of the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really, really happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all need, let's face it,
even though it sounds fun to have one,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually need safe places to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to sell, you have to have
a place to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have tourists, where are they
going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't go to a hotel, because it's not
legal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to provide a safe place for
people to consume, otherwise you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sending them back out onto the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I just want to bring up AB 1578,
which some of you know is the assembly
[SPEAKER_00]: bill that was put on by Assemblymember
Reggie Jones Sawyer, who's from South LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he created a bill that has already
passed the California State Assembly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically keep Trump and Sessions
out of our legal cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a federal non-cooperation bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already passed the assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it to pass the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's currently in hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a holding position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dead by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to either know at the end of
next week or in January if it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it passes through the Senate,
we're in great shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is at that time,
whether it's next week or in January,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a call to action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to need to get engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start calling, getting on the phone
and calling all these senators from
[SPEAKER_00]: California and telling them how to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody wants to be a part of that
list and you want to contribute when the
[SPEAKER_00]: call comes, there is a special list up at
the front where you checked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with the mailing
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be a mailing list thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so I, actually, can have your
information and know who to contact when
[SPEAKER_00]: we get that call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to be involved,
you want to do something, sign up on that
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll hold onto that and let you
know when I get that call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we really, really need to keep
those guys out of our legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we're licensed, they should have no
part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's AB 1578.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's coming soon.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, the state is going to issue
emergency regulations sometime in
[SPEAKER_00]: November.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a five-day comment
period for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once those new regulations come out,
if you are interested in commenting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, it's all over,
at least for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not on any lists,
get on lists and find out when this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening so that you could be a part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
