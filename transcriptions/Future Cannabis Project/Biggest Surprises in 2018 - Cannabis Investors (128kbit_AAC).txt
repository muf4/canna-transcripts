[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here in the Future
Cannabis Project talking about 2018
[SPEAKER_01]: reactions and assessments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you, in 2018, I need to
answer this with two things that caught me
[SPEAKER_01]: by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rapid pace of change in terms of
perception of cannabis in this country,
[SPEAKER_01]: medical, full rec, you name it,
little old ladies buying CBD online from
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon, it's extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pace of change to me, even though I
thought it was going to be extraordinary,
[SPEAKER_01]: has been beyond extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the investment community's
perspective, I'm not surprised at the
[SPEAKER_01]: sophistication of the players and the
folks at this table that have done this in
[SPEAKER_01]: other venues and are doing it here and big
institutional investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised at how quickly the
investment community is sorting through
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of businesses and
different verticals within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: investment subsectors and making quick
decisions right now on who's going to win
[SPEAKER_01]: and who's going to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, it's pretty interesting to
see how quickly we've gone from people who
[SPEAKER_01]: were, it seems to me, and maybe I'm
speaking my own book, but assessing where
[SPEAKER_01]: the first mover advantage was something
that seemed to be universally rewarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people are now, fortunately,
looking at companies that are really
[SPEAKER_01]: executing in a clever way, not just
because they were there first.
[SPEAKER_02]: From an international standpoint,
it's hard to be surprised that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jeff Session one really got me when he
came out and there's this stark difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between adult use, like medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably lost, at that point,
maybe $40, $50 million of investor
[SPEAKER_02]: confidence in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, are you actually that
concerned about these things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we know medically we have these
protections, like with OmniWest and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know adult use is totally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know the ancillary side is completely
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real estate, it's packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was surprised that so many serious
investors are so distracted by some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these little political things that have
been known forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was really surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the seasoned rural investor
would know the rules, understand what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I learned a lot of investors
don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they ask those questions now,
I'm like, you're not even serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk to you about our next fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk to you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the international side, seeing what we
did in Denmark, in Portugal, what happened
[SPEAKER_02]: in Macedonia, the preliminaries to Greece,
we're probably the largest licensing group
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally, I would say, on a private
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw maybe 25 countries pop up that
were totally anti-cannabis, but when they
[SPEAKER_02]: see the revenue, when they see the other
pieces, the kids with epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cancer, all the additional pieces,
where it finally clicked for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my company, our consulting company,
just went off the hook on international to
[SPEAKER_02]: where international used to be 30% of our
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's maybe 80% of our book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then seeing where the US is the
largest consumer market, but there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing called the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that all needs medicine,
ham, food, protein sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seeing so many countries come online so
fast, it was just realizing this is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come faster than we thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's getting exponentially faster by
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really the most important skill set,
being able to sift through what's real,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's not, true due diligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a country that has four licenses that
we have one in here, 12 groups say they
[SPEAKER_02]: have a license there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of talk about what people
intend to do versus what they're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, and how they're doing that,
or what they did correctly there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to get faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I realized quickly,
and I needed more translators and more
[SPEAKER_02]: Deloitte access than I would ever think
I'd profited previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your margins are going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay those accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surprise has been how fast,
how many states, how many countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many people are looking at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprised that the Trump administration
let it go and let it continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest surprise I had this
year was the CBD hemp becoming a system of
[SPEAKER_00]: separate industry, crossing into all 50
states, being to export health and
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness products made in the USA to
people in Indonesia and the Far Eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dubai.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's created new markets, new revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it will help legitimize the
benefits of cannabis by the CBD getting
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and helping so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
