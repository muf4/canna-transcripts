[SPEAKER_05]: So first, I'll start with Tim on the far
left over there if you can grab your
[SPEAKER_05]: microphone and give us your 15 second
elevator speech and introduction about
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you want to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tim Blake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the founder and the creator of the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our 15th year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the largest organic outdoor cannabis
competition in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have vertically integrated farms,
four farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a nursery, genetics, manufacturing
site, distribution, and product company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty well attached to every part
of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Sabrina Fendrick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm director of government affairs for
Berkeley Patients Group, and I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in the cannabis space for about
10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before BPG, I worked as an activist for
National Normal for about seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Sabrina.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Amanda Ostrowitz.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the CEO of Canarex.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a technology platform that tracks
all the laws and regulations in the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis space, everything from when a
city council first talks about the subject
[SPEAKER_06]: through their ordinances and so forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great to see so many of our
subscribers in the audience today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fiona Ma from San Francisco, home of the
medicinal cannabis movements.
[SPEAKER_07]: Served on the San Francisco border
supervisors, then six years in the state
[SPEAKER_07]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I am your friendly tax collector
trying to collect sales taxes on the
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensaries and found the big elephant in
the room is lack of banking access.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am and have been working on banking
access for this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's also mention that she's the next
California state treasurer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiona is running for state treasurer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since this is a private event,
I can endorse her.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please go out and vote November 6th,
is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: November 6th.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiona has been a supporter of this
industry since it was born.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's teamed up with a lot of folks up
in San Francisco and Sacramento that will
[SPEAKER_05]: make this industry easier and better for
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have witnessed Fiona personally on a
number of panels that John Chung,
[SPEAKER_05]: the current state treasurer, has put
together to try to solve and crack the nut
[SPEAKER_05]: of banking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally represent a lot of financial
institutions in my legal practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some in cannabis related stuff and some in
non-cannabis related stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even the national banks want into this
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are so many different
limitations that are put on them as a
[SPEAKER_05]: national institution, especially when
their federal charter is based,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, from a grant from the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not going to put that at risk if
they're a multi-trillion dollar bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're familiar with the way banks
operate, they have these stress tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the stress tests measure how much cash
they have on hand, how much assets they
[SPEAKER_05]: have on hand, and how much debt they have
outstanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these banks are imbalanced in
these stress tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're imbalanced, that means
they need cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is an industry that is full of
cash and nowhere to bank it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm working with a number of state
chartered banks right now to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: create protocols for them to take limited
deposits from highly vetted depositors.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that not everyone is going to
get access to a bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people that I see right now in the
industry getting access to banking are
[SPEAKER_05]: those that are coupled with something
else, like the private equity group that's
[SPEAKER_05]: investing in a cannabis group and the
private equity guys have the banking
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship and get the cannabis group
that they invested in to partner up with
[SPEAKER_05]: the bank that they're working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of politicking going on
behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I didn't mean to make that word a
bad word.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to add in later on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first issue I wanted to talk about
was actually ask Fiona what is she seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: right now in the banking landscape from
your perspective as a tax collector and
[SPEAKER_05]: then what you see going forward when you
sit in the treasurer's seat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator Bob Hertzberg and I had a bill
called SB 930 that would have allowed
[SPEAKER_07]: state chartered financial institutions to
apply for a limited permission to bank the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were hoping that this would have to be
a closed loop system, privately insured,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we were hoping that a number of
institutions would be part of the network
[SPEAKER_07]: and folks could deposit their cash and
they could pay their vendors through like
[SPEAKER_07]: a Venmo or PayPal type of system.
[SPEAKER_07]: They could pay their taxes and they could
pay their rent, which is like the largest,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, one of the largest expenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the bill got stuck in the
assembly appropriations committee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob Hertzberg and I are going to run the
bill again, but I have something to
[SPEAKER_07]: announce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator Steve Bradford, who is chair of
the banking committee and I are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: run a public bank bill next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of you have advocated, advocated
forward and running the bill this past
[SPEAKER_07]: year, seeing how much support we got from
legislators on both sides of the aisle,
[SPEAKER_07]: hardly any no votes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is time people in Sacramento
understand that this is a crisis and we
[SPEAKER_07]: need to get something done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I look forward to working with the next
governor on more of these type of issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we had our phone conversation,
one of the biggest issues that came up was
[SPEAKER_05]: taxes, along with educating consumers and
educating people in the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to now turn it over to Tim,
who had a very interesting perspective on
[SPEAKER_05]: taxes and issues dealing with the farms up
north and what is happening to them
[SPEAKER_05]: because of the tax crunch, for lack of a
better word.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you could kind of explain what is
going on and how you are seeing that world
[SPEAKER_05]: right now, because to me it was
fascinating, because being in Southern
[SPEAKER_05]: California and dealing with a lot of
indoor growers and distributors and banks,
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not seeing the landscape that you are
seeing in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is even larger than a tax issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a calamity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years ago we brought up about 400
people to Eureka to have a gathering of
[SPEAKER_00]: the supervisors and the fire department,
everybody to talk about how we are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to embrace cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a standing ovation at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week the BCC came up to Humboldt to
do their road show and there were less
[SPEAKER_00]: than 35 people in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody that showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were more people from the state than
there were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained to them that is because
they have given up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin talked about a grieving going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami talks about a thousand cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically have people that it is a
perfect storm where it was not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes, it is the taxes, but it is the land
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got the cultivators that have to
now apply to building codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got them having to deal with
water boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up north you could get away with doing
whatever you wanted for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the water boards in Fish and Game
were not in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they are in, it is like they used
to fly helicopters and then you had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: get a warrant, prove that you could go in
there and they would go to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble with cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you just fly over with Google map,
you see it on a computer, you send the
[SPEAKER_00]: $10,000 to $20,000 a day fine,
tell them they have got to shut down and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are sending out hundreds of
notices throughout Humboldt and Trinity
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are shutting down the markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that have been here for 40,
50, 60 years doing this, if you looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of Mendocino and Humboldt,
Trinity and Emerald Triangle, it is larger
[SPEAKER_00]: than most of the small states in this
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was like they said, this was a
coal issue with coal farmers or if this
[SPEAKER_00]: was a farm issue in Kansas, there is more
farmers being wiped out in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle than there are in Kansas or any
place where they are subsidizing farm
[SPEAKER_00]: labor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those farmers having trouble even
getting through the licensing process?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they getting licensed locally,
at the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are talking about that,
you have got less than 300 licensed farms
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendocino, less than 400 in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are having a very challenging time
because of, you know, Ed Rosenthal said
[SPEAKER_00]: it, we argued years ago and it is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, Mendocino, they were not made
for traditional farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land is steep, there is no soil,
lack of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is challenging but then you have got
deserts out here that are bringing 500,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot farms in and they are taking
the water from the Sierras or wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: else they are taking it from and they are
not in trouble but the landowners up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino cannot use their own water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between the building codes,
the taxes, everything, you are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look at 75% of the people that
built this industry are going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, you have got the
micro businesses and they are not letting
[SPEAKER_00]: people do home micro businesses for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the product makers, the small people
that did all that are gone too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am excited about 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: I voted for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am with Fiona and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we are going to be in a great
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumers are going to get the best
products they could ever hope for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to have, you know,
cost-effective medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a huge advocate for all the people
rotting away in jails across this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not want to say it is negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great thing we are going into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he asked about what we are seeing for
the small farmers and small product makers
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is an extinction event that they
are going into.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to dovetail with that issue to
Sabrina and to Amanda both on the
[SPEAKER_05]: education issue because I think that ties
into having knowledge about the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: how to deal with everything from supply
chains to consumers and everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: First with Amanda, from your perspective,
what are you seeing as the biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: challenges for your customers,
your clients and everything else getting
[SPEAKER_05]: access to information?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is not just about access to
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have the access but it is,
I mean, you cannot take the taxes issue
[SPEAKER_06]: lightly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we just talked about it in Humble and
Mendocino and Trinity but this is a
[SPEAKER_06]: statewide problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, we got to look at first the
fact that California is entirely different
[SPEAKER_06]: than any other state, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They passed medical laws in 1996 and local
government until very recently was the
[SPEAKER_06]: only ones regulating this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the time they could put in tax rates
that were higher because there was no
[SPEAKER_06]: state taxes but even those are still
prohibitively high when you layer state
[SPEAKER_06]: and local.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really what happened is a couple,
you know, consulting firms went around the
[SPEAKER_06]: state and told all these cities if you
allow and regulate cannabis, we are going
[SPEAKER_06]: to make you all this revenue and they kind
of made some promises of rates that were
[SPEAKER_06]: too high, rates that are prohibitively
high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are seeing some cities starting to
lower them but a lot of people are just
[SPEAKER_06]: moving out, giving up or staying in the
black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the problem is once they have heard
these lofty numbers, it is really hard for
[SPEAKER_06]: them to come back down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So part of this is the education to these
cities of understanding that these things
[SPEAKER_06]: are also going to bring in other revenues
in different ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we went down to Lemon Grove one
day, myself and a few of our clients to go
[SPEAKER_06]: to a city council meeting and we went to
the bar afterwards and had a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: drinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was interesting because we weren't
the regulars that were drinking $2 PBRs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were having $7, $8 drinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took, the people in this bar were
like, wait, so the cannabis business isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: just going to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are going to come to our bar and
spend money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, that means we are also going to
go to the grocery stores, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You are going to buy houses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this group of random people in the bar
understood the economic impact that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis might have on their town.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is not as simple or common an
experience of what is being, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: put out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these cities are really needing to
take a look at what is the overall job
[SPEAKER_06]: creation and economic impact that regular
sales tax could do there and these
[SPEAKER_06]: companies as a whole.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then talk about what are reasonable
tax rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is really where we are seeing a
lot of issues with this because a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people are just playing copy and paste the
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if they can do $25 a square foot,
why would we do $25 a square foot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody that collected taxes that could
give us their perspective on that issue,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We do track every single tax rate in the
state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have seen some, like, we tell
people, though, all right, yes,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have this chart that has every single
tax rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just because you see this one a lot
does not mean it is a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to look at these tax rates and
actually look at the patterns of cities
[SPEAKER_06]: lowering them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, one of our subscribers is
the city of Kalinga.
[SPEAKER_06]: They went in and they actually lowered
theirs, but they needed empirical,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, data to understand why these
weren't working.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were actually able to find that
information in our tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And lower their rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are going to have to see a lot more
of this for it to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no way otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I can give sort of a real
world example of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Berkeley, they had passed a 10% adult
use tax in 2010 when Prop 19 was on the
[SPEAKER_03]: ballot and they were expecting it to pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Prop 19 didn't have any tax rates
written into its actual initiatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was no 15% excise tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 10% at that time it wouldn't be as
significant without the tax rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're incorporating Prop 64 and
all of the additional layering and
[SPEAKER_03]: compounding tax rates that you're dealing
with, 10% and the way it was written was
[SPEAKER_03]: through the whole supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you wanted to get a manufactured
product in Berkeley, get it tested in
[SPEAKER_03]: Berkeley and sell it in Berkeley,
that's 10% on every single layer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a local tax of 30%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they ever legalize cultivation in
Berkeley, it would be another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a pretty big fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we realized very early on that this
was not sustainable at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were already dealing with the
illicit market and trying to compete with
[SPEAKER_03]: that and those economic incentives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it did take a lot of educating of
the city council and the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there were some people that came
out of the woodwork that shocked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was truly surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Berkeley, people were spouting this
reefer madness and that high tax rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sort of a counterintuitive approach
that they had where if you were to lower
[SPEAKER_03]: the taxes, then there would be lower
revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city was so excited about all of
the taxes that they were gonna get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they were against it, the finance
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really had to remind them that
everybody was going to the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not enforcing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were these high tax rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was really no way for them to
generate the tax revenue that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: expecting with these high rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also explaining of how the language
was written, they need to turn it,
[SPEAKER_03]: move the rate lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got it cut after about six weeks of
lobbying the city council and working with
[SPEAKER_03]: the local community leaders.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were finally able to pass an ordinance
that actually moved the rate down to 5%
[SPEAKER_03]: across the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And can I just add, Sabrina brings up
something important when she said lobbying
[SPEAKER_07]: the city council.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really important for all of you who
are in this industry and care about this
[SPEAKER_07]: industry to show up at city council
meetings at the state level.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had probably 10 different cannabis
bills running through the state
[SPEAKER_07]: legislature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if elected members don't see you up
there, then they say, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe they don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really important to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just not fight for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are just imploring you all to get
more involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign up for our newsletters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow us on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're always announcing how you all can
get more involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, get to know your local
elected officials, your state assembly
[SPEAKER_07]: member, your senator, and anybody else
that when issues come up, please send an
[SPEAKER_07]: email, call in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your voice really does matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one other thing to add too about
working with the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people of Berkeley are really lucky
that BPG has a Sabrina.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually invests in it because they're
all benefiting from it together.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can't rely on other people to do
this work for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say it adamantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: A compliance and government affairs
program are not as simple as just hiring a
[SPEAKER_06]: compliance officer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the difference between the ones that
are okay and getting by and wildly
[SPEAKER_06]: successful are the ones that have a
government affairs program.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is incredibly critical to have these
pieces in place because Berkeley got to
[SPEAKER_06]: have that education from Sabrina.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing that we also have to be
really careful with taxes and educating
[SPEAKER_06]: too is that they need to understand the
different portions of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's different people that have been
writing these tax measures.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can tell what an HDL tax measure
looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got one gross receipts price
generally for retail and then another one
[SPEAKER_06]: across the board for all the others.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at an SCI consulting one or
muni services, you're gonna see each piece
[SPEAKER_06]: actually getting explored differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might see in one city,
they might come out at $3 a square foot
[SPEAKER_06]: for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in another, they might come out at $6
because you need to actually do the
[SPEAKER_06]: analysis of what these businesses look
like in your city.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same consulting firm should come up
with different answers in each of these
[SPEAKER_06]: different categories based on what is a
business gonna look like there,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine if you were doing the same price
per square foot in Humboldt as you were
[SPEAKER_06]: doing in Los Angeles, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're unfair, why?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Humboldt, they're growing outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a lot more space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas indoors, they're gonna grow a lot
more in a much tighter spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you actually have to look at each
vertical that you're going to be taxing
[SPEAKER_06]: and give them an individual analysis and
make sure your government understands what
[SPEAKER_06]: those businesses look like in your
jurisdiction rather than them saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, well, we're right next to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's copy Oakland because we're
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every city is different and you really
gotta educate them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna add, I tell this to my clients
all the time that don't forget,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is still a real estate centric
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't get a license without being tied
to some real estate in some local
[SPEAKER_05]: jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you really have three masters.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the local government master that
you have to be compliant with whether
[SPEAKER_05]: zoning, taxes, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have the state master that you
have to be compliant with and make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: you're properly licensed and doing
business with other licensed folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, you have the conflict
of law with the federal government where
[SPEAKER_05]: the treasury says one thing, the
Department of Justice says another.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have all of these different
narrow paths that you have to follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it makes great work for
lawyers like us to help you navigate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, it is a massive
headache for everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so getting information and getting in
touch with those folks and being present
[SPEAKER_05]: is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to transition because we have a
lot of topics to cover and say that all of
[SPEAKER_05]: this with the tax issues, the real estate
issues and everything are hamstrung even
[SPEAKER_05]: further because of the banking issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the banking issue is a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first met Fiona a couple years ago,
she came and spoke at my law firm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hosted an event and I made a joke to
her.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, what if I just take all of my
gross revenue, pay it in cash to the state
[SPEAKER_05]: and just get a refund check?
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said to me, she goes, well,
because it would work, but the state would
[SPEAKER_05]: become the biggest money launderer in the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, you're probably already the
largest money launderer in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the state is who you want to be the
money launderer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want you to pay your taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if the state's the money launderer,
then... Well, then you've got a treasury
[SPEAKER_06]: check, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here is the great irony.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want everyone who is selling a tangible
personal product to take out a seller's
[SPEAKER_07]: permit and pay your sales taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't ask who you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need a background check.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just want you to pay your taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we take your taxes, count it,
walk across the street to Bank of America
[SPEAKER_07]: and deposit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you cannot go to Bank of America
and open up a bank account or deposit any
[SPEAKER_07]: money into Bank of America.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I overpay... How does that make
sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: If I overpay, I get a refund check from
the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you overpay, you would get a refund
check.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I overpay everything, I'd get a
refund check for everything, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did check that because that was a
loophole to say if everybody put their
[SPEAKER_07]: money in, can't we just hold it there for
future... Then you become a public bank.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and that's where we're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Always trying to think outside the box,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me get my notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I turned 46 in June and all of a sudden
I need these things on my face and I can't
[SPEAKER_05]: see the audience when I have them on and I
can't see the paper when I have them off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see me going up and... Oh,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I am when I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to go back to the banking and
talk to you, Tim, about what the market is
[SPEAKER_05]: looking like for folks that they still
have no access to banking up in farm
[SPEAKER_05]: country and Humboldt and everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that also adding to the crippling
effect that you're seeing?
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, is it resulting in a gray market
or an unlicensed market where we now have
[SPEAKER_05]: competing markets of people that are
dealing in the little licensed world and
[SPEAKER_05]: people that are dealing in the unlicensed
world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I mean, Community Credit up in
Garberville and Humboldt is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: giving some banking to cannabis people
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the smaller community credit
unions are working with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, because they took all the heavy
fines against those growers, the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market's thriving in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's not that many licensed
farmers, the legal market's thriving,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, for farmers, it's a decent
market, although 900 bucks a pound isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really a great price compared to what it
used to be, but at least it's stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: from where it was five or six last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have California Labor Solutions where
we do our own labor solution and pay cash
[SPEAKER_00]: payroll to try to get around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a real challenging thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been telling people for 40 years,
you look at Al Capone, he went to jail for
[SPEAKER_00]: tax evasion and money laundering,
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've told people, you know,
my whole life as an outlaw that your
[SPEAKER_00]: partner is the IRS and your tax people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what, they will get you
in trouble before anybody else will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them their share and just be cool
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really trying to do their best
to take that money in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Fiona and the state, everybody are
really doing what they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at what's going on in the
Canadian thing where they're shutting down
[SPEAKER_00]: the borders and not letting Canadian
companies in and people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because they see this powerful
thing that's about to take over the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're fighting over this,
the Canadians and the Israelis and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombians are looking at dividing up the
world market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have clients that are creating
investment vehicles in Canada simply to
[SPEAKER_05]: hold money into Canada with the hopes that
one day they can bring that money from
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada into the states.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's constellation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Coca-Cola with CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a dozen others that we're working with
that are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're just raising money in the
public markets and then saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll have a small operation in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once the floodgate opens, that money
will be able to pour into the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand that small farmers,
you know, typically if you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have been in this business,
they're introverted, shy, mountain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not branding experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not social media people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't go to a lot of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you go to more and more events.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old timers, we say we see less and
less of the old schoolers every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: turn around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see more suits, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: See more suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the industry where it's going and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think there's really much you
can turn that around for a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and family and people in those
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunate thing is they're not going
to see the new world kind of like Moses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean it's not the right
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the great thing that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There just is a very challenging time for
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got to remember, they have it
extra hard up there, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know many that bury their money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's forest fires that come
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people have lost their entire life
savings because they can't get their money
[SPEAKER_06]: to a bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gone up in flames literally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And where else is it going to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too much to stick under a bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we've got to be really cognizant of
that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that it's not, banking is not
100% impossible, as you were saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of do it up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of, you have to be very
careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's FinCEN guidelines and just the
sheer physical moving of the cash from the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary to the next place that it goes
to the bank and scheduling the pickups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is legitimately disconcerting,
I will say.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was at Normal, it was sort of a
talking point and an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then actually being in it,
seeing how it works and how the scheduling
[SPEAKER_03]: works, it's very uncomfortable and can be
very scary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's part of my practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I actually create checklists and
due diligence checklists for banks on the
[SPEAKER_05]: SAR KYC AML issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once the banks figure out how much
work is involved, they don't want to do it
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go to the Board of Directors
and have spent all this time, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: paying a lawyer to set it up for you and
the Board of Directors says, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't want to do cannabis, all of a
sudden it's just money out the window for
[SPEAKER_05]: these banks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that we feel bad for the banks putting
money out the window, but you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: realize how the suspicious activity
report, what it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: In essence, the federal government has
deputized the banks to act as their eyes
[SPEAKER_05]: and ears on the ground to look for
suspicious activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: FinCEN, in its wisdom, took the coal memo
from the federal, from the Department of
[SPEAKER_05]: Justice and said, we're going to bootstrap
this into a way for banks to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: file these suspicious activity reports,
but create these limited marijuana SARs so
[SPEAKER_05]: that they can actually bank state
compliant businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: On January 4th, Jeff Sessions,
as we all know, rescinded the coal memo.
[SPEAKER_05]: But FinCEN, two weeks later, reaffirmed it
and reaffirmed the FinCEN guidelines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the banks are kind of like,
do we do what the Treasury says or do we
[SPEAKER_05]: do what the Department of Justice says?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're in this conundrum of not even
knowing where the federal government
[SPEAKER_05]: stands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just a microcosm of our federal
government right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But go ahead, Fiona.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were talking about taxes earlier and
we are very low in terms of how much we
[SPEAKER_07]: have collected in California taxes versus
what we estimated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first six months in 2018,
we collected about $82 million of taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We estimated we would collect about $185
million.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a couple of reasons,
I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, the state is just,
is starting to issue permanent licenses,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're waiting for the local
government.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the localities have not
approved cannabis, are still working it
[SPEAKER_07]: out, still fighting about it, or their
taxes are too high where companies don't
[SPEAKER_07]: want to locate in that jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_07]: In comparison, Nevada, for the first six
months, collected $195 million in taxes,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado and Washington, which were the
first two states to actually have adult
[SPEAKER_07]: use, Colorado collected $114 million,
Washington $67 million.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet Nevada just passed last year and
they're at $195, more than California
[SPEAKER_07]: estimated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think taxes, regulations,
fees, it's mind-boggling here in
[SPEAKER_07]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally think that part of the
problem is this, is that we gave too much
[SPEAKER_05]: power to the local governments and it's a
patchwork and mosaic of rules and laws
[SPEAKER_05]: that are very difficult to follow,
very costly, and if the state would set
[SPEAKER_05]: its own standard and then municipalities
could just say yes or no, I think it would
[SPEAKER_05]: be much easier in that regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have, thank you guys,
and then you have the other issue,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is, I can't remember which city is
which, but Santa Ana and Costa Mesa have
[SPEAKER_05]: their own regulations about cannabis and
how you can sell and where you can sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them says you have to have a
security guard in uniform that's armed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one says you can't have
armed security guards and you can't have
[SPEAKER_05]: uniformed security guards.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can literally cross the street and
have a totally different scheme that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're operating under for a dispensary,
and you're none the wiser as a consumer
[SPEAKER_05]: that this happens to be the Costa Mesa and
this other side of the street happens to
[SPEAKER_05]: be Santa Ana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really just discombobulated world
that we're living in right now in the way
[SPEAKER_05]: it's set up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Richard, Prop 64 passed by the
voters.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the California voters, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: California voters.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only way we can change any of the
provisions, the major provisions in that
[SPEAKER_07]: initiative is to go back to the voters.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that I think people
don't understand is when we pass an
[SPEAKER_07]: initiative at the state level by the
people, we can only change it by going
[SPEAKER_07]: back on the ballot and asking the people
if we can change it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the legislature passes legislation.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have somebody like my mom,
my mom says, isn't it legal now?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's her whole knowledge of the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom might be here because I grew up in
Long Beach since she was gonna come by.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mom, are you here?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had my prom in this room and
this pillar right here is where my date
[SPEAKER_05]: left me, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, my assistant Amy, we're gonna
tell stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, we used to come here and this
ship is haunted and we used to hear people
[SPEAKER_07]: knocking on the walls.
I do have one mom in the audience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's my mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's your mom?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, awesome, awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I invited my parents so they
didn't show up, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I'm one of those dads,
like yesterday was soccer practice and I
[SPEAKER_05]: was here, so I can't, it's history
repeating itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I digress.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I wanted to ask you
specifically was this, and I had this
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation with Javier Becerra.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had this conversation with Lori Ajax
and I wanna have this conversation with
[SPEAKER_05]: you and we talked about it on the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: The state's infrastructure for dealing
with the cannabis regulations and
[SPEAKER_05]: enforcement, what does that look like
right now and what should it really look
[SPEAKER_05]: like?
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful what you wish for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The enforcement is not there yet,
so we are still trying to just get
[SPEAKER_07]: licenses issued.
[SPEAKER_07]: The track and trace system is ready to go,
according to Richard Parrott of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Department of Food and Ag, but we're just
waiting to issue those first licenses,
[SPEAKER_07]: because everybody right now is operating
under a temporary license.
[SPEAKER_07]: So track and trace is gonna go first,
then once everyone gets onto that system,
[SPEAKER_07]: then I think we'll be able to enforce
those good actors versus those bad actors.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Becerra said to me when he got into
office, this is right when he took over as
[SPEAKER_05]: attorney general, he said we have a great
infrastructure in place for sanctuary
[SPEAKER_05]: cities and sanctuary state issues and
immigration to fight the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: government.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, what about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, we don't have anybody even
assigned to a task force at this point to
[SPEAKER_05]: deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that was a year and a half ago,
two years ago when he took over,
[SPEAKER_05]: so I'm sure the landscape has changed,
but I saw your friend Kevin De Leon six
[SPEAKER_05]: months ago and asked him what he was
focused on and it was all about the
[SPEAKER_05]: immigration issues and the sanctuary state
issues as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis was very far off of his radar
as well, which hopefully changes when he
[SPEAKER_05]: wins the election in November.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sabrina, I was actually gonna jump to
you and this is not a softball.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually one of the things that
you had mentioned to me that I thought was
[SPEAKER_05]: fascinating was how educating the staff
and the rule changes are so confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted you to kind of expand on that
and explain that to the audience because
[SPEAKER_05]: we talk, as a lawyer, we deal with rules
all the time, but with boots on the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground, I think that the landscape is much
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like you to kind of explain the
dichotomy that exists between us and our
[SPEAKER_05]: suits and the people that are on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, January 1st was when all of these
new rules started to take effect and there
[SPEAKER_03]: was a lot of preparation for the staff and
letting them know, well, as you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this industry has a lot of rumors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was the whole process for the
emergency regulations that happened in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were talking, some people thought
they were implemented already and people
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't really realize that there were
certain timelines for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to make sure that they knew that
things were going to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules as they are now are not gonna be
the rules forever and please be patient
[SPEAKER_03]: with me and with this whole process
because it's completely out of my hands,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we have to play by this game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to explain how the rules were
working pre-July 1st and it also had to
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of switch over our whole business
model, not our whole business model,
[SPEAKER_03]: but previously where we had our buyers
would work directly with the vendors and
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't go through the distributors and
that entire process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with the excise tax collection,
there were a lot of steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of checklists that I had
to create to pass out to the staff to sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of let them know how this worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when July 1st kicked in and you
had the new testing rules, you had the new
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging and the new labeling rules and
then that sort of created as anybody who's
[SPEAKER_03]: a retailer or distributor, manufacturer,
cultivator knows, everybody had their own
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation on what was compliant
packaging or compliant labeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a lot of back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard somebody on the earlier panel was
saying they were sort of talking about how
[SPEAKER_03]: they had to go and talk to the retailers
and the retailers were having their own
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was a lot of back and forth
and our buyer would come and ask a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: questions and what the distributors were
telling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I discussed with our lawyer and we were
just like, what the DPH is telling you is
[SPEAKER_03]: complete.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is compliant is great, but we're
licensed by the Bureau, we're inspected by
[SPEAKER_03]: the Bureau and I just don't see the Bureau
thinking that it's okay to have certain
[SPEAKER_03]: types of products with certain labels.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not gonna fly with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, nowhere in the regulations is
really do they address what the packaging
[SPEAKER_03]: and labeling rules are for clones or
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so DPH doesn't address it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bureau doesn't really address it and
CDFA doesn't really address it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody refers back to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then so we were like, the only place
that addresses it is in statute.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the Business and Professions Code
which says every cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: product has to be in a child-resistant,
resealable, blah, blah, blah package.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that upset a lot of people and there's
been a lot of debate, but ultimately we
[SPEAKER_03]: were like, this is literally the only
thing that we can lean on and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have to go with this until there becomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an actual statute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, actual statute until there's more
clarity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always ask people if you have a letter
from the Bureau that says this is okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everybody has to get ready because
we're gonna gear up for more changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just finished the first round of
comment period for permanent regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's gonna kick back into gear in
October and November and then there's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be more changes in 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: One practical takeaway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't buy more packaging than you can use
in the next six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will continue to change it on you and
you will end up with a bunch of waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't try to tell the retailers that
it's compliant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just sat on a panel with the
Department of Food and Ag, California
[SPEAKER_07]: Department of Food and Ag and also the
Department, California Department of
[SPEAKER_07]: Public Health and they would like folks to
go to their website.
[SPEAKER_07]: They try to put as much information up
there and FAQ page as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have any questions,
they're really encouraging you to call
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Call or email them, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's their message to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CDTFA has been absolutely amazing and
they definitely advocate that anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get everything in writing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is absolutely critical because you
talk to one person one day and they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you talk to another person the next
day and they'll tell you something
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you can get it in writing
and you can show you're making a good
[SPEAKER_03]: faith effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to bring up one more topic
very, very quickly that I'm seeing as a
[SPEAKER_05]: lawyer in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are really two topics that have been
coming up quite a bit which I think you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys have to have just be cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is that remember that bankruptcy is a
federal process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis businesses and even cannabis
adjacent businesses are being kicked out
[SPEAKER_05]: of bankruptcy courts because the trustees
that are being assigned can't even take
[SPEAKER_05]: control of these businesses because their
source of money is coming from sources
[SPEAKER_05]: that are not legitimate in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things I've been doing is
what I call alternatives to bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Assignments for benefit of creditors which
people are not very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Receiverships where you go to state court
and that's the state court to put a
[SPEAKER_05]: receiver over the business.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing it on behalf of
creditors, on behalf of partners that are
[SPEAKER_05]: having disputes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been an ever-expanding landscape.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually this is how I got into this
industry 10 years ago when a bank client
[SPEAKER_05]: asked me to deal with a property that they
thought was a refrigerated warehousing
[SPEAKER_05]: facility out in Pomona and did a site
inspection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I discovered it was a giant million
square foot cannabis grow facility and
[SPEAKER_05]: they had to call the loan but couldn't
take possession of the property because
[SPEAKER_05]: they can't foreclose.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually put it in receivership,
had the receiver sell the flower,
[SPEAKER_05]: sell the license and sell the property.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then it was medical marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not under Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that I was going to tell
you is this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Product liability claims are starting to
come in the door where we're defending
[SPEAKER_05]: product liability claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's not disclosing properly what's in
the package.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not giving warnings to customers that are
not used to eating an edible that's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to put them in bed for four days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prop 65 issues with chemicals that cause
cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know you go into a restaurant and it
says this facility may contain products
[SPEAKER_05]: that contain cancerous materials or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a huge, huge thing that's coming
down the pike.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think that plaintiff's lawyers
are out there right now waiting for those
[SPEAKER_05]: big businesses and cannabis to take them
to court.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once the big plaintiff's lawyers are
out there suing the big companies of the
[SPEAKER_05]: world, the targets start becoming more and
more narrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got to be really cognizant of
that and be very careful of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you bring up insurance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our insurance commissioner Dave Jones has
been issuing licenses to different
[SPEAKER_07]: insurance carriers for different type of
licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know please look on their website.
[SPEAKER_07]: Camille Dixon is his expert in these
insurance issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: But insurance is coming to the market too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I refer clients to insurance folks all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they come to me now because they want
to get access to my clients of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this lightning round what I want to
do is that's my big issue and big problem
[SPEAKER_05]: that I'm seeing with my clients right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to just go down the table starting
actually Tim going this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: First we're going to say what is the
biggest problem you see in ten words or
[SPEAKER_05]: less.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to go and say what is
the silver lining you see in the next
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start with the bad and then we'll
go to the good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll finish off with the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good part is we're California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dominate the country,
the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: our heritage and stuff, we're gonna do
fine long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest challenges for me is that you
need compliance attorneys, you need
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance people, you need so much that
if you don't have a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have a hard time being in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not really a fair playing
field, it's really, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a capitalist society, and you're
looking at Constellation, you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at Coca-Cola, you're looking at some major
players coming in, and it's like how do
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers and how do small product
makers compete with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the biggest challenge would be the
constant pivoting, the re-education,
[SPEAKER_03]: just the wears and tears of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The silver lining, I would say,
is that this is a very agile industry that
[SPEAKER_03]: has been around for a really long time and
will continue to be around, and we are
[SPEAKER_03]: very creative and able to, we've survived
the federal interference, we've survived
[SPEAKER_03]: lots of trials and tribulations so this is
just another challenge that we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have to go through and I think we're gonna
come out okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say the biggest obstacle I'm seeing
right, I don't have it personally because
[SPEAKER_06]: we just track all the law, but taxes,
hands down it's taxes, I guess silver
[SPEAKER_06]: lining, it's gonna keep all the attorneys
and consultants in business for a long
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have to throw the T in the harbor,
is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I'd say silver lining is that just
in the first inning of a nine inning base
[SPEAKER_06]: ball game, and so we're gonna continue to
see problems, but we're gonna also be
[SPEAKER_06]: working to fix those for a long time,
so never expect the regulations to stay
[SPEAKER_06]: the same, and that's gonna mean a constant
re-education which is truly a pain point,
[SPEAKER_06]: but over the next five years there's gonna
be continuous improvements too,
[SPEAKER_06]: and these kinks are gonna get worked out,
they're just taking a first shot at it and
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't expect anyone to get it right on
their first try.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the biggest barrier or challenge to
banking access, public safety,
[SPEAKER_07]: and collecting taxes is Congress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress, the silver lining is November
6th is coming, we need to flip these
[SPEAKER_07]: seats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go out and vote, now if you have questions
we have a microphone set up here for
[SPEAKER_05]: questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is an awesome panel, my name is
Joe Devlin with the city of Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently you have to eat the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like an ice cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: So taxes are definitely too high,
how do we facilitate that conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: amongst the local governments,
the patchwork doesn't work, I mean there's
[SPEAKER_04]: some things that can be done, CDTFA can
lower the markup rate down to zero
[SPEAKER_04]: tomorrow, so that would help, but across
the state we have to have a more
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent taxation, so how do we,
the League of Cities is an entity that
[SPEAKER_04]: exists, but they're not leading that
conversation, is there another avenue of
[SPEAKER_04]: facilitating that dialogue, and how do we
shorten that implementation difference?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned the League of Cities and
CSAC as well, but you go into the League
[SPEAKER_06]: of Cities, and I was there as a guest once
in their office, and the password to the
[SPEAKER_06]: WiFi, no joke, was local control,
and that's kind of the, I wish it was a
[SPEAKER_06]: joke, but that's actually their password
for the guest WiFi if you need it ever,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's kind of the problem with the
League of Cities, is their thing,
[SPEAKER_06]: what's interesting is they're not
advocating anything in policy,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're advocating for local control,
so even when you see them as
[SPEAKER_06]: anti-delivery, the current delivery
regulation, not anti-delivery,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're anti the cities getting to choose
whether or not deliveries go to those
[SPEAKER_06]: cities, and so it's really hard when the
ethos has always been let the cities make
[SPEAKER_06]: their own decisions, so therefore it needs
to come outside of those organizations,
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's gotta be education
opportunities where you can bring in the
[SPEAKER_06]: neutral bodies in the spaces to actually
educate on it, so like we had a counties
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis conference last summer,
and that was very effective, and I'd love
[SPEAKER_06]: to help you facilitate this meeting of the
minds for the cannabis tax conversation
[SPEAKER_06]: for the cities, but we're gonna have to
somehow figure out how to pull that group
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could start, though, by just,
yeah, but you could start by coming up
[SPEAKER_06]: with a range of things that are
reasonable, talk about output-based taxes
[SPEAKER_06]: as opposed to square footage taxes,
I mean, there's a lot of things,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we still gotta educate them on what
those even mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's step one before you can
start looking at restructuring the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about what's working and what's
not, and what's being done around,
[SPEAKER_06]: and an honest conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's not working?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, Joe, what I was saying is these
taxes are prescribed in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, you either have to go to the
ballot with a million dollars of
[SPEAKER_07]: signatures or get two thirds of the
legislature to put it on the ballot,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think right now, the appetite at the
state level is people understand that this
[SPEAKER_07]: is a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I would advocate all of you
to do, is go and educate your state
[SPEAKER_07]: assembly person and your state senator,
and talk about how these taxes perhaps are
[SPEAKER_07]: too high, and it's really hampering this
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the problem is that- You need to
explain why it's actually a problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it seems counterintuitive that
high tax rates are not gonna generate more
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sort of had to bury the city council
in data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this happened in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their taxes was way too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a compounding effect,
and they had to lower it because they
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't compete with the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 10% of zero is zero if everybody's
going to the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really comes down to showing them a
lot of, and I have a lot of data that I
[SPEAKER_03]: put together, this huge package is showing
from all over, and not just with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but with other products and commodities,
that you have to have the right economic
[SPEAKER_03]: price point to be able to compete with the
illicit market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree with Fiona.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uniformity from the state down is gonna be
the best way to solve this problem,
[SPEAKER_05]: because the patchwork of Mosaic is not
working for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no way to organize everybody
in this industry in one voice,
[SPEAKER_05]: because everybody's dealing with fractured
different issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it really is a state level issue at
this point, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you'd need data, but also what
localities are successful, and what their
[SPEAKER_07]: tax structure is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can have those leaders highlight
it, then maybe others would follow instead
[SPEAKER_07]: of just pulling a number out of thin air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a patchwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the League of Cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have never been done this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: 64 was a broker deal, and the cities and
counties should never have had this input.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we got a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's leading to a lot of corruption
cases around the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what she's saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I didn't want to get involved
politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been an outlaw my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago, I got involved on a daily,
weekly basis in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched it make a difference in
Mendocino and the small cities around
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people listen when you go in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same 10 people that go to
these supervisors meetings and these
[SPEAKER_00]: council meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to get involved, because they
will listen to you, and it will make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if any of you can speak to
this, but I think something that's often
[SPEAKER_02]: underrepresented in the conversation about
pain points is the influence of inaccuracy
[SPEAKER_02]: and inconsistency in testing, and how
that's being addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the BCC in Humboldt last week,
there was a motion to put that in for
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized testing for all the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was approved by the BCC there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was an amazing moment to see,
because that's been a mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get asked all the time, where would you
invest if you were going to invest in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a policy of not investing with
my clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always say, right now, there's a
dearth of testing labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could invest in that,
I think there's something like 40 that are
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed, 22 that are active, and 500 that
are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but who gets the testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The labs that get the highest THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: THC ratings, and the cannabinoids and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all encouraged to raise those
numbers up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a self-fulfilling circle in that
regard, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And one other thing is, this is something
you have to be patient with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So back in Colorado, right, this is the
first time we're testing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't even know how best to test
it for starters.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were actually trying to figure
out, how do we create a proficiency test
[SPEAKER_06]: to make sure that all the labs are coming
up with the same test results on the same
[SPEAKER_06]: thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I watched them spend 45 minutes
talking about, OK, if we have a slab of
[SPEAKER_06]: shatter, how do we take the right piece so
that we all have a consistent piece?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 45 minutes, 10 testing labs trying
to figure out how they would even take the
[SPEAKER_06]: part out of the slab that they would each
have the same piece to know that they were
[SPEAKER_06]: testing it to figure out if they can test
similarly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take time, because this is
brand new.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need the scientists and whatnot to
get involved and figure out how to even
[SPEAKER_06]: test that everyone is coming up with the
same results on the same item.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly, I just got a slight shiver down
my spine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about the track and trace and
metric determining the good and bad
[SPEAKER_01]: players, especially after having been up
north, going on a whole bunch of farms
[SPEAKER_01]: that are trying to implement with SICPA
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then metric, of course, doesn't have a
native distribution component.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my question is, what if it goes
south?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a plan B?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it goes south in California,
it could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the playing field could be even more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember buying weed in the 80s?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's plan B.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think government has a plan B.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just expect this to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I heard from Richard
Parrott, who's the director of the track
[SPEAKER_07]: and trace program at the Department of
Food and Ag, that they are ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's cross our fingers and hope it
works.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of trial by error
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a canned speech, which I'll give a
very short part of, which is we are all
[SPEAKER_05]: pioneers in this industry, and we all have
to be held to a high standard because we
[SPEAKER_05]: know that there's a high level of scrutiny
on what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as in any new industry, we're going to
learn from our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have to make sure we don't repeat
the same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think with track and trade,
it's another example where we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: do some stuff that works, and we're going
to find out some stuff that really doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: work, and it's going to have to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are infants in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll tell you this, this is the kind
of phone calls I'm getting now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting phone calls from New York,
Boston, and Canada from people from
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical companies, large tobacco
companies, large alcohol companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to figure out ways to start
leveraging this market today so that when
[SPEAKER_05]: that five-year term is up, they can move
in very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting as to the dynamics
that I'm seeing behind the scenes from a
[SPEAKER_05]: legal perspective and how people are
gearing up for this at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people are shaking their head,
no, some people are shaking their head,
[SPEAKER_05]: yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the nature of anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Prohibition when it ended.
[SPEAKER_05]: You went from moonshiners to Jim Beam.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not everyone became Jim Beam.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to have this powerful effect
on the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think looking at the future,
five years from now, we're going to be in
[SPEAKER_05]: this room, and everyone's going to be
dressed more like me and less like the
[SPEAKER_05]: Swami that I saw in the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, which is kind of sad,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think we have any more
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to thank Tim, Sabrina,
Amanda, and Fiona.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got to go out and vote,
please.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a real voice for our industry
going into the Treasury right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please, please vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: And vote for Fiona.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
