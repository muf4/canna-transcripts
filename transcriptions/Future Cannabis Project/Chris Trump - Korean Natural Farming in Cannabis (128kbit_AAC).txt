[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Fontanelles with Phantom Farms out
of Oregon here in the One Log Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the Regenerative Science of
Cannabis Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a 700-acre macadamia nut farm on the
Big Island of Hawaii that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: transitioned to 100% natural farming and
having all kinds of success.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a profitable year last year that
made up for the 10 years before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: More profitability than the 10 years
before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something we're talking about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about natural farming and
some of the problems people had or some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the questions people had.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first questions I got to talk
about today was, how do you scale this for
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial operations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting with no one better for talking
about that in cannabis than my friend
[SPEAKER_02]: Eddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, there are some definite dynamics
to doing natural farming in a wheelbarrow
[SPEAKER_02]: versus doing it on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some pretty significant learning
curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a 90,000-pound pile of IMO-3 and I
had a rain event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a week-long rain event and I wasn't
undercover and I had to scramble to save
[SPEAKER_02]: the pile and eventually I had to spread it
in the rain because it was I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get enough water saturation that I wasn't
going to be able to do any more aerobic
[SPEAKER_02]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some physical logistical
difficulties you can run into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's also the learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach five-day classes to help people
overcome the learning curve and make
[SPEAKER_02]: videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even still, there's nuance that you have
to be willing to let the process teach you
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get over having a failure and
not calling that the end but saying that's
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the learning journey, then you're
going to have fun with it and you will
[SPEAKER_02]: totally learn eventually because it's like
anything practice makes better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eddie, even scaling natural farming for
your grow and as far as cannabis grows go,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're pretty big.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that been?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: To relate to what you're saying about
making mistakes, definitely you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a lot of mistakes to scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing foliar, a lot of foliaring
with the KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see instant results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are just standing up,
the leaves and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say you just have to make all the
mistakes and it's a journey and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: got to keep cruising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn a lot of things about yourself
and everyone else around you in the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you find doing that with natural
farming 100%?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say enough good things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so awesome to not have to deal
with chemicals anymore and have to rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: store bought products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were telling me about your turfing
profiles changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on our indoor facility,
full LEDs, living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hitting three to four percent
turps every time, which is pretty hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with salt fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've hit as high as seven percent turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed itself is just a better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more vibrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma, it's just really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The issues of scaling and all of that,
I would say you're better off learning on
[SPEAKER_02]: a small experiment than learning with
something giant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did years of playing with things and
becoming really proficient before I tried
[SPEAKER_02]: a 90,000 pound pile of IMO and it was
going perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than an event that I couldn't
account for, it would have been awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say get your learning curve out
with small experiments rather than an
[SPEAKER_02]: entire farm or some big expensive costly
problem if you mess up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question we got was people are
encountering, they're starting off really
[SPEAKER_02]: well and they're having to fall off in the
effects of natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who is experiencing that,
but if that's a question we're being
[SPEAKER_02]: asked, I would say that probably has more
to do with an understanding of what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then something with the system being off
just because we've had so much success
[SPEAKER_02]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly people that have taken the
time to really get into it and learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to fully do it with just
online resource, especially IMO,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some nuance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like baking, learning to make a
souffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have the same ingredients as the
guy next to you and his souffle looks
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful and rises and yours is like this
flat mush pancake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has more to do with technique than
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria will give you a boost initially
and you'll have fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you can get diversity of
microbial life, fungi and yeast in your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, you're going to have this perpetual
climb to health and production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that been your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been seeing success,
so I have not seen any bust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely with the IMOs, it's been
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's arduous for sure trying to figure out
how to be in the right place at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, just making the
mistakes and learning from them and just
[SPEAKER_00]: rising up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it'll kick in and it's all
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you run into ... how do you know when
to apply?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you apply?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there's something I want to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it transitioning ignorant farmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: IMOs or IMOs in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd say though, after taking a five-day
class, you were equipped with that
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You understood when I needed to apply it
and how that whole system works.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is the knowledge of available
online is limited and or it's hard to sift
[SPEAKER_02]: through and You know, sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that it's a lot of this is
difficult to learn remotely Where when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're feeling it and smelling it and
seeing the nuance in person, it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just a little easier So that's difficult
That question though is one I got a lot so
[SPEAKER_02]: I did This week will actually launch an
online class on this
[SPEAKER_02]: The risk is greater at greater scale Yeah,
the bigger the bigger it is the the more
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you're running into problems You
know, I started watching his videos and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all the stuff and that's a great
starting point But as soon as I started,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, reading the literature I went to
his class I learned way more than I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: did by watching the videos and trying it
on my own So there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: information out there than just the videos
and and that said the the some people do
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit Some pieces of the natural
farming system and that's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing the the reality is this is
just Natural farming isn't the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't like the magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not gonna have Guaranteed
everything it's gonna work out for you
[SPEAKER_02]: financially if you play with natural
farming It's just there's it's an elegant
[SPEAKER_02]: method to use the principles that are
already at work in nature and so What you
[SPEAKER_02]: have in nature is just this cool
interconnectivity of light and water and
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and and soil nutrients that the
plant could take up and that's That's
[SPEAKER_02]: special and you can get into and access
that a lot of different ways You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's there's systems all over the world
where passed down knowledge has been
[SPEAKER_02]: applied effectively because farmers are
good scientists basically and But natural
[SPEAKER_02]: farming is an elegant method.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a way to kind of take these
principles of nature In a kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: easy-to-access package and make them
applicable on your farm one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: people ask is how How what if I'm gonna
use just one part I don't want to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: it or I already have this thing I do what
should I do and I would say if you could
[SPEAKER_02]: wrap your head just around I am a one and
two I am o2 is a great thing where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in some water and Get it on as a
soil drench or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome Maintenance solution
is crazy easy if you can overcome or get
[SPEAKER_02]: OHN or make some it's just you can you
don't have to know anything you can just
[SPEAKER_02]: apply it once a week and you'll have add
general health and and Production to your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and it's it's really simple You
don't there's not a whole set of processes
[SPEAKER_02]: once you have those tools on the shelf FPJ
Brown or fermented plant juice brown rice
[SPEAKER_02]: vinegar and Oreo herbal nutrient on the
shelf you can just spray it on your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: any old time and Get the benefit from that
you do that pretty regularly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so we eat foliar once a week and then
we stop and week for a flower and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it works killer Yeah, super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you could talk a little bit
about your experience with the master like
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy sure going to to learn from his
doctor I have the privilege of about the
[SPEAKER_02]: time on our farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some events that caused us to say
hey what's going on in nature with These
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits these things were seeing that
happen that weren't explained in
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional farming So we were looking
for answers We were willing to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: check what we knew at the door because we
had saw seen some things that happened on
[SPEAKER_02]: our farm where there's health came when we
left the land fallow and So we started
[SPEAKER_02]: searching and about that time a friend of
mine David Fuertes got a grant and brought
[SPEAKER_02]: master Cho to Kohala a little tiny town in
on the Big Island of Hawaii so I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: really grateful as part of where I share
knowledge because I Literally was farming
[SPEAKER_02]: in a tiny rural town in Hawaii and this
dude from Korea Decided this was the place
[SPEAKER_02]: that he was gonna land and this knowledge
was gonna get first kind of transferred
[SPEAKER_02]: into English and So I'm super grateful for
that and hanging out Initially master Cho
[SPEAKER_02]: did a lot of teaching with his daughter
Jeanne Cho and she She's really good at
[SPEAKER_02]: translating into practical She doesn't
work with them anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the beginning that was really
helpful to kind of master Cho is He he saw
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical fertilizers coming to Korea and
he said I need to give farmers another way
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't gonna be all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's kind of a little foresight like
this might not work out so well and He
[SPEAKER_02]: made this system and it came some from
Japan studying with a doctor and enzyme
[SPEAKER_02]: theory and and there was a lot of cool
knowledge that was passed down in Japan
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it came some from having a dream
and waking up and trying it on a farm for
[SPEAKER_02]: years and you know finding these methods
are effective and and a few other doctors
[SPEAKER_02]: he studied under in Japan and then some
traditional practices in Korea and
[SPEAKER_02]: Combined them just to kind of an elegant
accessible method Hanging out with them is
[SPEAKER_02]: fun getting He'll slap you if you do
things right or wrong so big big back
[SPEAKER_02]: smack and Great non politically correct
jokes and demonstrations to explain how
[SPEAKER_02]: nature works so I don't usually tell those
because Some are offensive to our Western
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset, but um, he's um He's somebody
that has been beaten to death for sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming knowledge Korean
government after the Korean War was
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for communists and he was sharing
knowledge on farms with farmers and that
[SPEAKER_02]: coming together and community was a little
taboo at that time and so he he's paid
[SPEAKER_02]: costs for for sharing this knowledge and
he's continued to and You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he taught me how to taste soil and and
know Know the the nuance differences,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this is Has good microbial
balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is too high in nitrogen you know,
this is doesn't have anything going on and
[SPEAKER_02]: You know fun fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's um The the real beauty of
natural farming is it's an invitation to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to look at your plants and look at
nature and kind of Understand what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on when you say you kind of have a sense
of like oh This is this is what my plants
[SPEAKER_02]: need right now or I need to do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that grown for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely Yeah, I I'm stoked when
actually with the day that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always like I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love it Do you get to see kind of
some of what your plants need?
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of see their changes and their
shifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like your observation is grown
as a farmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure and and to you, you know,
we're on we're on cycles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like pretty repetitive,
you know, it's repeatable basically So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we flip the lights to flower and
we know and you can see you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the changes So yeah,
I got a chance to hang out with master Cho
[SPEAKER_00]: myself a couple months ago on the big
island and Just nothing but respect for
[SPEAKER_00]: those that family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super nice You know, they they've
brought in this thing They're bringing it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the states and and they could attract
trademarked or patented it and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not you know, they're they just
want to share with everyone which is which
[SPEAKER_00]: is very commendable, you know,
that's what it's all about just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: help each other out and You know not
trying to hit a home run off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so That's a culture in natural
farming there's there's some giving And
[SPEAKER_02]: and gratitude involved which I think is
pretty cool to perpetuate, you know to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue People wonder about like oh what
it was the best plant to use for my FPJ
[SPEAKER_02]: and You know, and then they see you know,
it's a tropical situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using papaya So they go down to
the local supermarket and buy a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: papayas and make FPJ and that's not really
it You're gonna run into problems with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's something that's pretty
common and on the online kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: information is people going and buying
pineapple or something for flavor and the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem is those fruits are all bleach
washed and and really the only microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: life you have on them is gonna be what the
guy who put it on the shelves had on his
[SPEAKER_02]: hand or what you had on your hands when
you were making FPJ and and so people get
[SPEAKER_02]: these blooms of weird stuff happening on
the surface the FPJs and I usually know oh
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you you know you store-bought fruit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that you don't grow bananas
in Washington and The so one of the keys
[SPEAKER_02]: in natural farming is this can be really
inexpensive I really can because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts you use and using the right amount
at the right time, but the the things to
[SPEAKER_02]: use for some of these nutrients are stuff
that's wild in your area and you really
[SPEAKER_02]: got to turn your Your sight on so to speak
It's gonna be a bit of a mental shift more
[SPEAKER_02]: than anything because you got to drive
down your street Or walk in your local
[SPEAKER_02]: woods or or go, you know in your
neighborhood and you look for these plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that you basically have overlooked your
whole life You know ivy or ice plant or
[SPEAKER_02]: you know lemongrass all these things that
just grow everywhere Nobody ever takes
[SPEAKER_02]: care of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always healthy and thriving and
vibrant and new shoots and and Those
[SPEAKER_02]: actually are plants that are getting
complete nutrients from their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good at harvesting Nutrients,
they also are full of plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do why do we put kelp on our farms?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why do we buy kelp products?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well because kelp is this extremely
vibrant fast growing strong plant It's one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the fastest growing plants in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full of beneficial plant growth
growth hormone and Minor minerals from the
[SPEAKER_02]: ocean and so you take these plants that
are growing and thriving around you that
[SPEAKER_02]: are taking up nutrients really well
They're gonna be packed with nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: they grow so well in part because they
have these these strengths these
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial plant these beneficial
biochemicals That your plant once you
[SPEAKER_02]: micronize it through fermentation your
plants actually gonna benefit from these
[SPEAKER_02]: Complex foods that we don't even know the
bottom of we don't know all the reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: all these things are our food for plants
and and taken up so so kind of cruise down
[SPEAKER_02]: through your neighborhood and and look for
the things that are free, you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that nobody's gonna care if you
whack, you know hundred pounds of that
[SPEAKER_02]: because Nobody even realizes it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just always growing and healthy and
that's gonna actually probably serve you a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot better than a papaya from a local food
supermarket Might even be able to create
[SPEAKER_01]: some jobs by harvesting some of that stuff
and doing like, you know fire abatement
[SPEAKER_01]: You know cleaned up brush and stuff turn
that into can that right blackberries
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, blackberry shoots the old
blackberries are gonna have big gnarly
[SPEAKER_02]: thorns You probably don't want to mash on
that But in the spring you see all the
[SPEAKER_02]: blackberry shoots shoot up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that's got a entire plant
energy and beneficial biochemicals being
[SPEAKER_02]: forced into it and you can just whack all
that and straight benefit from your your
[SPEAKER_02]: Your local resource that's free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why why buy it when?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature is literally this plant has stored
all the nutrients it can collect and shot
[SPEAKER_02]: it into these shoots for you To get ready
to harvest and yeah, you're dancing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ready to go get the Blackberry
shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were questions you would ask me in
the beginning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Yeah, I mean I so we started off just
doing FPJs and we were like dude we're
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming this is awesome
Like don't look at the plants are crushing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, we totally thought we were
doing it But I wish I would have talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and even like yeah, that's that's like
the stepping stone, you know That's just
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so but I mean, like I said,
we made all the mistakes and cruised
[SPEAKER_00]: cruise through it and and you know Now
we're now we're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and you were you were I mean as far as
farming you were there were some difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where you guys at now as
profitability is it changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean so like an organ rating If you're
if you're if you're if you're surviving
[SPEAKER_00]: you're crushing it and that's where we're
at right now So we're like barely getting
[SPEAKER_00]: by but yeah, it's it is what it is that
organ markets is so docile the price drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know hit the bottom and But you know,
thank God for the Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we were, you know buying all
these store inputs still we'd be probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not in business, you know, so Yeah,
I'm not a cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a farmer of you know tree crops
and I Farm a market garden in Boise,
[SPEAKER_02]: Idaho right now, but that's the farmers
plight kind of all over the world You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's not It's not just here and it's
not just cannabis So I I hope that this
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge is actually like hey,
there's a profitable way to farm and You
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to Bleed money until you go out
of business to be organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a solution that where you can have
steady yields And a really healthy crop So
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope for my kids that our food system
shifts and changes that they're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy from the low street local grocery
store real You know medicine food,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know food that's really helping their
body and you know making them run fast
[SPEAKER_02]: because right now some of the stuff we're
facing as far as human health is a Direct
[SPEAKER_02]: result of our farming system and I think
that can shift I hope it can and and and I
[SPEAKER_02]: hope that there's hope in this story for
Farmers that are struggling with their
[SPEAKER_01]: with their bottom line You guys talk about
petrochemical maybe and like how those
[SPEAKER_01]: can't the fermentation and digestion of
Micronization of the nutrients is Better
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant and why petrochemicals cause
these problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean with chemicals you're
you're you're killing your microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not what we're trying to do
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to nurture and harness
microbiology and so you gotta you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use Any chemicals because you're just
you're going backwards Yeah, I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: wear like hazmat suits for your your
sprays, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we used to spray miticides
insecticides Fungicides and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to wear a mask and a Tyvek suit
and it was horrible, you know And but that
[SPEAKER_00]: was really like that was how was it
presented to us It was like this is how
[SPEAKER_00]: you get rid of powder mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to spray Eagle 20, you know,
you have mites you have to spray avid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's a quick fix and and
that's you know, KNF isn't like that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have fortitude you have to build
it up and And so it's not just a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: shot, you know for shot in the pan or
whatever And plants in system where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting through biochemical
communication with microbes They're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're demanding and needing when they
need it and as a result plant in its cell
[SPEAKER_02]: walls and It will create complete proteins
It is the last thing a bug wants to eat
[SPEAKER_02]: because the amount of energy to deal with
that cell wall is so difficult they
[SPEAKER_02]: they're they're not going to make a bunch
of babies and and thrive because They're
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't have a good food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a difficult food source It's
like dropping somebody off in the Alps and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying here build a family, you know,
it's It's gonna be hard and and so when
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants are able to create complete
nutrients They're able to have their own
[SPEAKER_02]: self-defense against bugs etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And You know some some people are are
using a chemical fertilizer and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like I want to make a shift there's a big
risk and you could even just add in an IMO
[SPEAKER_02]: or an LAB to what you're doing You want to
do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know just really Nilly with this
stuff and you'll make something funky and
[SPEAKER_02]: it won't really help you on your grow But
I'm doing something well in conjunction
[SPEAKER_02]: with some chemical nutrients You can
actually get crazy results because the
[SPEAKER_02]: only thing that make those chemical
nutrients totally available to your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are microbes Plants can't thrive in a
vacuum So even if you are growing with
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical fertilizer you are already
relying on micro microbial life to help
[SPEAKER_02]: your roots uptake those nutrients and
bringing in some more microbial life will
[SPEAKER_02]: only Help with your yields and your
general profitability So yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Yeah farming stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's um and it's Yeah, and you guys
I mean we we farm for a dollar 25 a pound
[SPEAKER_02]: in our product Yeah macadamia nuts But no,
it's it's a calling and and it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful like the gratitude you can have
to be able to play in soil and with nature
[SPEAKER_02]: and Just the beauty that exists in the
whole process I think approaching that
[SPEAKER_02]: with gratitude is part of what natural
farming is that there are some things we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't create You know, we're not we're
not creating this beautiful symphony of
[SPEAKER_02]: connectivity and soil and microbial life
and and light and photosynthesis and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know all this Cohesive, you know energy
we're just benefiting from it and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, whatever it is you're growing and so
I think There's a great deal of
[SPEAKER_02]: thankfulness we can have as we approach
nature and the gift it is You You
