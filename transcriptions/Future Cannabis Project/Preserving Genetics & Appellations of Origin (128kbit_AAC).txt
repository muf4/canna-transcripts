[SPEAKER_05]: California, unlike any place in the world,
is woven from a diverse fabric of dynamic
[SPEAKER_05]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rolling hills and foggy coastlines,
which sit atop unique deposits of rich and
[SPEAKER_05]: bountiful soil, create a cultivation
environment unlike anywhere else in the
[SPEAKER_05]: world, which I'm sure we're all aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a licensed distributor based in San
Francisco, Philly Green believes in the
[SPEAKER_05]: celebration of these extraordinary
Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_05]: They strive to be an active voice in the
articulation of these incredible stories
[SPEAKER_05]: through community events and their online
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: They believe that they can more than
educate the market about these vivid
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more loyal their consumer base will
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: People who consume cannabis want to feel a
connection to the land, and these
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals on our panel today are at the
forefront of forging those bonds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a huge thanks for Philly Green and for
all the panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to pass it off to Janine Coleman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Janine Coleman.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the director of the Mendocino
Appalachians Project, and I'd like to
[SPEAKER_09]: introduce my esteemed panelists.
[SPEAKER_09]: To my left here is the one and only
Frenchy Canoli.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we have Dan Promorantz, the CEO and
founder of Rebel Grown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hezekiah Allen, the chair of Emerald
Grown.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dale Hunt, founder of Plant and Planet
Law Firm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to give thanks to Camp Navarro,
which is situated in Rancho Navarro.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rancho Navarro is a countercultural
area of historic importance to our
[SPEAKER_09]: community here in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a large subdivision.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a rural residential area that's zoned
for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're smaller parcels, and so
they're more affordable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so historically over the decades,
it's been a community that really has
[SPEAKER_09]: given the young people, the next
generation, and small families their start
[SPEAKER_09]: to be able to get their foot in the door
to the local economy of Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I really want to give a shout out
to this decades-long historic area that
[SPEAKER_09]: we're enjoying this event in and really
acknowledge the importance of these
[SPEAKER_09]: incubator areas to the economic
development of rural producing areas like
[SPEAKER_09]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to give a special thanks to
Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have been really, really supportive
of getting our local community out here
[SPEAKER_09]: and getting the members of our trade
associations present and really want to
[SPEAKER_09]: thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a beautiful event.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to do a series of
introductions, and then we have a couple
[SPEAKER_09]: of discussion topics, and then we'll open
it up for Q&A at the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk a little bit about
geographic indication systems and offer an
[SPEAKER_09]: overview for the panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: So geographic indication systems are a
category of intellectual property rights.
[SPEAKER_09]: They collectively belong to the region
that's tied to producing and special
[SPEAKER_09]: practices and the product of the region.
[SPEAKER_09]: An appellation of origin is a special kind
of geographic indication that's got
[SPEAKER_09]: standards associated with it that really
codify and protect the practices,
[SPEAKER_09]: the heritage, and the special genetics of
the region.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in California, we've got a few tools
now in state law.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got county of origin, which is a
general geographic indication that's tied
[SPEAKER_09]: to our counties.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in 2017, the industry lobbied and
really advocated to get appellation of
[SPEAKER_09]: origin in California statute with the very
special associated standards, practices,
[SPEAKER_09]: and cultivars tied to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so right now, we've got those two
tools in law, and the California
[SPEAKER_09]: Department of Food and Egg will be taking
petitions for appellation of origin in
[SPEAKER_09]: 2021.
[SPEAKER_09]: And right now, they're working to develop
the regulations to support the program.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're excited to see this moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Mendocino, a little hand, yeah,
shout out to Cal Cannabis for working on
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis appellations.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're putting a lot of resources to it,
and I think that's a really significant
[SPEAKER_09]: thing for us in this time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a really important tool
for us moving forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Mendocino Appellations Project is
part of a coalition of regional trade
[SPEAKER_09]: organizations that are working together to
realize this tremendous opportunity for
[SPEAKER_09]: standards-based, legally recognized,
nationally and internationally recognized
[SPEAKER_09]: appellation of origin protections.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're doing this from the basis of
rural economic development and really
[SPEAKER_09]: thinking about sustainability when it
comes to our rural economic development,
[SPEAKER_09]: because this is happening fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a tsunami upon us, and it's very
important that as we build policy in a
[SPEAKER_09]: market, that we think about rural economic
development and doing so in a way that's
[SPEAKER_09]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a little bit about what I'm
working on and the overall topic that
[SPEAKER_09]: we're going to be addressing around
genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to go ahead and pass this on
so the panelists can introduce themselves
[SPEAKER_09]: and tell us a little bit about what y'all
are working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I heard the word terroir
here in California was with Tim Blake and
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Stone from Aficionado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I'm French and it's part of my
culture, it resonated really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to study it because as much
as it's part of my culture, I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know very much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us in Europe, every agricultural
product that has a certain degustative
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, the value of it is the origin of
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole, literally the whole country
of France, it's based on the standard of
[SPEAKER_00]: appellation of origin and appellation of
origin of quality that give the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: protection for the farmer and protection
internationally and bring the name of that
[SPEAKER_00]: little farm in the middle of nowhere to
the world view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every standard that are made are
dedicated solely to create that quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and get greater than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the word appellation of origin,
it's internationally protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to follow certain standards to
the letter that have been given by France.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the choice here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you do like the American wine and you
create your own classification for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and you have to make it so good
that the rest of the world, when they
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize, they want to follow your
standard and your regulation and your
[SPEAKER_00]: classification because it's it,
like they did for the wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you follow the appellation of origin
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wine industry didn't do it because
they needed to create their wine industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed to have no limitation so that
they could create the amazing wine that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so much diversity, so much
quality, so much microclimate that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need literally to define it and classify
it because it's so rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need basically those limitation to
understand what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: My world worried all that time was,
how can we prove that there is a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: And during my study, there is a French
government website that tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you need to know about
appellation of origin and control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot is in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made me realize that actually
even Bordeaux was recognized as a terroir
[SPEAKER_00]: because the wine coming from Bordeaux were
recognized worldwide for their quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to prove that you have a
cannabis terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world over knows that you're growing
the best quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need to define the terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And defining a terroir goes beyond
defining a region.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow a so-so quality cultivar in
Bordeaux, it will not get an appellation
[SPEAKER_00]: of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow the greatest quality of
cultivar but in the wrong part of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bordeaux, it's not considered an
appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not everywhere in Bordeaux that is a
terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certain parts that are terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the art problems, the art labors that
you have, it's to define all those amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: terroirs that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like every agriculture is
like wine, except that in the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: industry they have 20, 30 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 1,000 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes things more complicated,
but it makes you so much richer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of terpene or what you can bring on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, every one of your
farm, when you work with living soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: you really use the whole beneficial life
force of wine, where you grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to make your produce different
than the neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can go even deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are recognized for that uniqueness of
that specific genetics that is grown on
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I've lived in many producing
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have here, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't know how much you are worth,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first of all, I really appreciate being
invited to speak on this panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of an honor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done some public speaking,
but none.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of like the white collar
cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm kind of coming in and
representing people who work with the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, the growing community,
small craft farmers from the Emerald
[SPEAKER_06]: Triangle, and people who are really
dedicating their lives to breeding work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little slow recovering this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so let's talk about and touch on some
of the things that Frenchie was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about, which is, what is the purpose and
the origin of these Appalachians?
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Europe, where they came from is
really the small craft farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Romania and France, in certain
regions where they were producing a wine
[SPEAKER_06]: or a varietal of grape that was famous and
was starting to make their names famous,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then all of a sudden, larger producers
started saying, I want to get in on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to produce that Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to produce what this little
microclimate in Romania is doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to produce champagne.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those small communities that were not
rich, wealthy farmers, they were small
[SPEAKER_06]: family-run businesses, said, how can we
possibly compete against these massive
[SPEAKER_06]: scale operations that can just demolish us
in terms of efficiency and cost of
[SPEAKER_06]: production?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this goes back what?
[SPEAKER_06]: He probably knows more of the history,
but 100, 150 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: They worked with their governments to
establish themselves and say, look,
[SPEAKER_06]: we started this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the originators of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The process of how we grow these grapes
and what's in our unique atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_06]: microclimate and our soils, this is
champagne.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get anything like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can replicate it, but it will never be
the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has to have some intrinsic value
of being an originator and putting in
[SPEAKER_06]: decades and decades of work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in California, northern California
especially, I grew up on the East Coast
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I loved smoking outdoor weed because
of the unique terpenes, but there's really
[SPEAKER_06]: no comparison.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I came out my first season in
Humboldt, I was still iffy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I kind of wish we had some lights,
you know, to show you kind of what I can
[SPEAKER_06]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: After that first season, my life was
changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was completely blown away about what the
environment can actually do.
[SPEAKER_06]: The intensity of the sun, the balances in
the coastal versus inland microclimates,
[SPEAKER_06]: the elevation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really life changing just
seeing how incredible and how diverse
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis can be at all these spectrums
because of these unique areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then over the years, as I started
traveling and doing consulting work or
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting different farms, I've been able to
see genetics similar and unique grown in
[SPEAKER_06]: all these different areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Humboldt County alone is the size of a
lot of small states.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just in southern Humboldt alone,
you know, the east or west side of the 101
[SPEAKER_06]: represents a dozen or so little
microclimates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are more coastal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are closer to the redwoods
and are just above a temperate rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them go way too far out and
they're dry, but you can see and taste the
[SPEAKER_06]: difference in the flavors and terpenes and
resin production between all those
[SPEAKER_06]: different regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And same with Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that I have a pretty good
palette.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoke a lot and have seen herb produce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's unique things to say about
what are some of the textures that
[SPEAKER_06]: resonate to me that are similar whenever I
see herb from Bell Springs versus Island
[SPEAKER_06]: Mountain versus Laytonville versus
Combshe, versus Burnt Ranch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the deal is it's really something
unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in California right now, everybody is
competing over this market share,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is eventually going to be really big
for California.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reality is that California
cannabis has something really amazing to
[SPEAKER_06]: offer the entire world.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the value.
[SPEAKER_06]: California originates culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, besides, you know, San Francisco
and tech, but we have Southern California
[SPEAKER_06]: where I've only ventured to a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 20 million consumers down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those types of people, they need
education about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's happening is a lot of people
want to get in and they want to make money
[SPEAKER_06]: because they think that cannabis is going
to be a business where they can just get
[SPEAKER_06]: in and make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's folks who preserved the way by
taking a lot of substantial risk and
[SPEAKER_06]: devotion and determination for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Appalachians of origin is a way to
potentially protect and preserve the way
[SPEAKER_06]: of life for those folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's happening is there's massive scale
commercial production in Southern
[SPEAKER_06]: California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some really nice
microclimates.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's green belts in Santa Barbara where
they grow certain varietals of wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that the balance for
Appalachians in Northern California is
[SPEAKER_06]: really established.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's really important that
we're establishing not just the
[SPEAKER_06]: microclimates and the difference between
what varietal grows best in what area or
[SPEAKER_06]: what farm grows them and for what reasons,
but also the stories behind those regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because just like in Champaign,
you know, I have an associate of mine who
[SPEAKER_06]: has an artisanal wine imports business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So two months ago he was in Champaign,
met with small farmers, was able to tour
[SPEAKER_06]: these facilities where they've been passed
down for multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are not wealthy people.
[SPEAKER_06]: They live in small houses.
[SPEAKER_06]: They work their own grapes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then their village, it's like a
church, a little store, and then a
[SPEAKER_06]: community processing facility where they
have these cooperative models.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these Champaign producers, they all
share time about, you know, they can all
[SPEAKER_06]: make their grapes or their wine in
different processes and store them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the only way that they could ever
survive is by, you know, communally kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of sharing that whole operation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are folks, they've never had
that Champaign ever distributed more than
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 miles from where it was grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a friend of mine, his company goes and
meets those farmers and brings it over to
[SPEAKER_06]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what California's model needs to be
for the future because I know that in my
[SPEAKER_06]: neighborhood, the Palo Verde, we have some
very, very special sacred energy from like
[SPEAKER_06]: the Native Americans to the early
homesteaders to the cannabis that's grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I picture people in Tokyo buying a
quarter ounce of that stuff and 10 years
[SPEAKER_06]: from now going, you can't get this
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you hear the story behind it and
who produced it and why, it's the most
[SPEAKER_06]: sacred thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I think something like this
is really important because, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: what matters are the producers and the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything in between is a part of the
process, but the producers are the
[SPEAKER_06]: creators and the consumers are the ones
ingesting this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're the ones who need the
education and to know about the importance
[SPEAKER_06]: of all these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I was really excited to participate
in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish that we had a lot more than
just one hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the genetic side of it is another
huge, huge thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because where are your genetics coming
from?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is in them?
[SPEAKER_06]: How did they get to be what they are?
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that is one of the greatest
stories of cannabis because it originally
[SPEAKER_06]: started with some land-raised varietals
somewhere that had been growing maybe for
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands and thousands of years and over
millennia of nomadic tribes traveling and
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing seeds to the modernization of
cannabis and all the hybridization.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like over the last 70 years,
there's never been an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand any of that, to do medical
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been too illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who were paving the way with
breeding back in the 70s, 80s,
[SPEAKER_06]: 90s, they had such restrictive laws and
law enforcement that they couldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: document most of their work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now modern-day cannabis breeders are up
against massive challenges in terms of the
[SPEAKER_06]: preservation of these genetics and how do
you apply science and weave in and out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really intense times for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exciting, intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's really, you know,
if you look at the end of prohibition of
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol, you know, it didn't just settle
right away to the point where there's five
[SPEAKER_06]: or six conglomerates that bought up all
the companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there were tens, if not hundreds
of thousands of people making their living
[SPEAKER_06]: through some type of bootleg or being
involved in alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: That transition took decades to settle
into, you know, an industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a really amazing historical
time for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially for Northern California,
we have some really special to offer to
[SPEAKER_06]: the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's really important that we
find a way to represent that properly,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and present it well so that it
can have the impact that it needs to so
[SPEAKER_06]: that our industry doesn't die out and go
to a bunch of greedy corporations and
[SPEAKER_06]: massive-scale commodity producers who
really only care about money at the end of
[SPEAKER_06]: the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a little take from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Hezekiah Allen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to see you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Janine did a great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you, Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Meadow, for getting us all
together again out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working on this project called
Emerald Grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure a handful of you are familiar
with Emerald Grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Started it back in late 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our first meeting properly turned into a
group therapy session where a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: friends and neighbors were admitting to
each other they were growers for the first
[SPEAKER_04]: time ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a fair amount of tears,
a lot of laughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, I think we were
stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were stronger than we were before it.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time, we were, you know,
sort of just dusting off our... I was born
[SPEAKER_04]: and raised off the grid in Southern
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandparents started growing in
Pennsylvania in the 60s, yada,
[SPEAKER_04]: yada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been a grower all my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were really just starting to
sort of pick our heads up and realize what
[SPEAKER_04]: life off the hill was going to look like,
acknowledging the future was coming and
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was time to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if we're not a part of it,
we're not going to be a part of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, simply put.
[SPEAKER_04]: So evolved from there into realizing that
a lot of what we wanted to do was still
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Salatin has that book,
everything I want to do is illegal,
[SPEAKER_04]: something to that effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still is and it definitely still was in
2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Frenchy and Dan mentioned the
cooperative models of the old world and
[SPEAKER_04]: the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't form co-ops.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually weren't allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agricultural co-ops are common in
California, but we couldn't form them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there were a handful of things we
identified coming out of those series of
[SPEAKER_04]: meetings that became the advocacy platform
that we advanced in the capital over the
[SPEAKER_04]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appalachians being one of those four
pillars, regulation is agriculture,
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainability, sort of the basic core
tenets that we decided make our community
[SPEAKER_04]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty pleased to say that we checked
off all of those boxes on our policy
[SPEAKER_04]: goals.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not to say that the regulations are
something that I celebrate as being
[SPEAKER_04]: finished, good or even bearable.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, it is to say that when,
I don't know if any of you, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke Brunner used to be around at a lot of
these meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first meeting that Luke and I,
we were not invited to the meeting with
[SPEAKER_04]: Senator Correa.
[SPEAKER_04]: We elbowed our way in and they said,
this is a closed meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, no, we read the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're allowed to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the people's government.
[SPEAKER_04]: That meeting was proposing the Board of
Pharmacy would issue 30 licenses
[SPEAKER_04]: statewide, mandatory vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while it's not great, just think of how
far we've come from, that was July of
[SPEAKER_04]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be here talking about this topic and
talking about what we can do together,
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottom line, what we've been
discovering, at least what I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: discovering through this process of
catharsis is that we genuinely are
[SPEAKER_04]: stronger together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And being able to work together is
probably the most important thing we can
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so hence Emerald Grown, it is a
federation of cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Cooperative Associations are
capped at four acres each.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are aggregating several of those co-ops
through this model, you know, locally
[SPEAKER_04]: owned facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't announced this publicly yet,
but we do now own three acres of
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial property just north of
Laytonville, where the first Long Valley
[SPEAKER_04]: Center will be built out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Nevada County, we have a facility
out there that we're working on build out
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of to serve as those first hubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I applaud all of you licensees that have
made it through this on the first wave,
[SPEAKER_04]: let me tell you what.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, how this all ties into our
conversation today, obviously marketing is
[SPEAKER_04]: a huge part of our future going forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've organized our marketing strategy
into five pillars.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're going to have a very
strong house brand and Emerald Grown will
[SPEAKER_04]: be on products at every price point on
every shelf in about three years,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is what we'll ramp up to.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the one of the brands pillars
that we have is the regional brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an adventurous, playful
marketing effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a welcoming hand taking you on the
adventure of your lifetime into the middle
[SPEAKER_04]: of nowhere in California, these most
beautiful beaches where you can find the
[SPEAKER_04]: solitude, these most bustling of urban
areas where you can find the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be a guide.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to welcome and invite people into
this experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to do it in a way that's open
and inclusive, because the beautiful thing
[SPEAKER_04]: about Appalachians to me and about the
their shared assets, I am unabashedly a
[SPEAKER_04]: socialist.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no surprise that these programs
largely developed in socialist countries
[SPEAKER_04]: where quality of life matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of taking something from France,
there's so many policies in France that
[SPEAKER_04]: would be so unpalatable in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: economic system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the more that we can cross pollinate
between our market driven system and the
[SPEAKER_04]: common good that is more common in
European social democracies, the better
[SPEAKER_04]: humanity is going to be, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this idea of thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, humanity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't totally suck yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth like 30 years until
civilization goes away if we don't do
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just keep that in the back of our
minds while we're building our cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, that we're not just building our
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're building a beacon of
hope for the broader world if we do it
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the these are shared assets.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the common point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody owns Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody owns Bell Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all of ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've built them together and it is our
responsibility and it is incumbent on us
[SPEAKER_04]: to manage them together and to share the
benefits of those things equitably.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right now, unfortunately,
we're doing this panel at the same time as
[SPEAKER_04]: equity.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, this conversation is about equity.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we manage shared resources is about
fairness and equity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to try to privatize those things,
to try to make them mine is unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a moral travesty tragedy that we
all need to call bullshit on and we all
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be better than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know I know that we didn't come here
necessarily on this Saturday, Sunday,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunday, Sunday weekend in the woods to
like hold our feet to the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is how it is in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feet to the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to manage these assets together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do better and be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am excited to be a part of that with
all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I just want to start by saying I was
excited to be on this panel before I heard
[SPEAKER_01]: all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just an honor to be on this panel
with everybody here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started as a botanist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody told me in college that I
couldn't consider myself educated unless
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd had a biology class and botany fit in
my schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after three sessions, it was so
fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed my major and I never looked
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no good reason to take botany,
but I loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my major.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I stuck around for a master's
degree in plant genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I didn't have anything better
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to UC San Diego to do a
PhD in molecular and cell biology,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I did also in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by then I knew I didn't want to be a
professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to Berkeley for law school and
became a patent attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even that was a long ass time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 23 years ago, I started working as an
attorney in a law firm and one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: clients was a Central Valley fruit company
that made great varieties of stone fruits
[SPEAKER_01]: and grapevines, table grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the opportunity to help them
protect their genetics all around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just protect, but commercialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to that, I did a bunch of
other kinds of patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't know that I was preparing
myself to work in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my mission now really, the way I see it
is the difference, and I've worked with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of other plant genetics companies,
but the difference between all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and every other company I know
that works with plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this industry is that in every one of
those companies, the plant breeders are
[SPEAKER_01]: employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either the founders of the
companies, in which case they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: great, or they're employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sign their assignments of their
patent rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have fine jobs, but they're
employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this industry, in many cases,
they're successful entrepreneurs already.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, they're the rebels,
they're the outlaws, they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: survivors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they need to be the rock
stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are going to be the absolute rock
stars of this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who they are, you know who you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And super creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the plant with the greatest
genetic potential of any.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's one other thing about this
plant that is, this is not unique to this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but it's unusual at least,
that the patent system, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: bore the hell out of you, but I do have to
tell you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patent system for plants is kind of
divided between, it's divided three ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's divided between plants that you
propagate asexually, and plants that you
[SPEAKER_01]: clone, or plants that you propagate with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, as you know, with cannabis,
you go both ways, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that makes it complicated to even
know how to protect what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: or which kind of IP to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was on the phone yesterday,
with a friend of mine who was speaking at
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis event, a patent attorney was
speaking at a cannabis event in DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, just give me the short
rundown on, I need to sound like I know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, just read the blog I posted
last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, it's five minutes at most.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, just explain it to me quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK, well, first thing you need to
know is, they might make their money by
[SPEAKER_01]: selling clones, or they might make their
money by selling seeds, or they might just
[SPEAKER_01]: sell harvested material.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might make an extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kind of IP they get totally
depends on how they're making their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I said, anyway, we had this whole
conversation, and she decided it was way
[SPEAKER_01]: too complicated, and she's just going to
send everybody to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one other story I want to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an attorney, you work in an
office a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite things I ever did was
to get out of the office and come up here
[SPEAKER_01]: and meet with one of my clients,
who's a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a farm up in Leightonville,
way up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sent me back to San Diego with a
bunch of samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two of my favorite people that I work
with are experts at tasting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I brought them back some stuff from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't look like the stuff they
usually get, I think, because the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: they usually get isn't grown outdoors in
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, oh, this doesn't look like what
we usually get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they started to roll it and said,
this is super sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they smoked it, and they said,
this is the best stuff we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next time I went on a road
trip, they came with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being here is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with people who grow the plant is
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do feel like it's an honor to be
part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just glad to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to take the conversation
specifically into genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think from an Appalachian's perspective,
it's really kind of the heart and soul of
[SPEAKER_09]: the designation, because it's really the
plant and the product where the place,
[SPEAKER_09]: the practices, the cultural knowledge
behind how the plant is produced and loved
[SPEAKER_09]: and nurtured into a product really
expresses through the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_09]: And cannabis is such a responsive plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: It responds so personally to our
endocannabinoid system, to the environment
[SPEAKER_09]: that we're cultivating in and our
practices.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's really kind of the heart and
soul of how we differentiate ourselves and
[SPEAKER_09]: how these Appalachian of origin
designations will come into bearing fruit
[SPEAKER_09]: for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a number of threats to our
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick, I'd like to see a show of
hands for the breeders in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of people here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for all your work.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't be here without you,
really.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're facing, first of all,
it's an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the risk to losing our cultivar
lines is already high from the start as an
[SPEAKER_09]: annual.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're facing regional bans where
before we had the capacity to cultivate
[SPEAKER_09]: under our previous regulatory regime.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got hemp coming forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that does pose a risk to our cultivars
as we transition rapidly into hemp
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a number of things facing really
threatening our genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think it's important to really
contextualize this as the first priority
[SPEAKER_09]: when we're working to really establish our
Appalachian of origin protections and
[SPEAKER_09]: really build the tools that we need to
meaningfully protect our cultivars moving
[SPEAKER_09]: forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to look at the international context,
because Appalachian of origin is an
[SPEAKER_09]: international protection, there's a number
of ways that the world bodies have framed
[SPEAKER_09]: avenues of protection for our work.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you look at the World Health
Organization, and there's international
[SPEAKER_09]: policy tools around rights of access to
traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a traditional medicine that we've
been really nurturing over the decades.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's really important to
remember that.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's traditional knowledge embedded in
the work that we're doing, traditional
[SPEAKER_09]: cultural perspectives and expressions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are the things that we're
protecting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, there was a pretty amazing
piece of policy that was approved by the
[SPEAKER_09]: UN.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Declaration on the Rights of
Peasants and Other Working People in Rural
[SPEAKER_09]: Areas.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's specific language in there to
protect our genetic resources and
[SPEAKER_09]: recognition about how that's a bedrock of
rural economies and agrarian economies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I want to put those thoughts
forward and understand that we're creating
[SPEAKER_09]: an Appalachian of origin system,
not for wine, but for a traditional
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's a unique perspective and
set of considerations that we need to put
[SPEAKER_09]: into this work as we frame these
protections, not just for the producers
[SPEAKER_09]: and the consumers, but for the patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because how we produce our medicine and
what genetics we're working with and how
[SPEAKER_09]: those express in the diverse expression of
cannabinoids and turbinates that have
[SPEAKER_09]: medical value that we have yet to even
really understand has to be at the
[SPEAKER_09]: forefront of how we're building our
Appalachian of origin system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So really wanted to put some love out for
the history of medical cannabis advocacy
[SPEAKER_09]: and how we've all gotten here over the
decades and really give thanks to that
[SPEAKER_09]: aspect of the plant as a healing plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with genetic preservation, it's all
about the details.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for instance, with plant patterning,
what you would do is you would
[SPEAKER_06]: characterize these genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big question that we need to figure
out is what genetics grow well in specific
[SPEAKER_06]: regions and for what purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no research into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's neighborhoods where someone may
have been developing a varietal for a
[SPEAKER_06]: decade, two decades, three decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't have the research to know
what variety is going to perform better in
[SPEAKER_06]: this coastal environment versus this
inland climate and for what reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have the farmers are the ones who
have that data.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, man, this whole conversation,
we should leave politics out of it because
[SPEAKER_06]: this is all about representing the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: The farmers are the ones who have this
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones who have this experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, most farmers were afraid to
write down notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't keep data records of your
yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I remember being at a poker game
where someone was talking about all the
[SPEAKER_06]: records that they have from their harvest
and trimming records.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they got laughed out of the room
because these guys are like, dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to if they raid your house,
you're going to get indicted and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to have all this information on all
these genetics records.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we used to have notebooks and,
you know, have them buried in the woods
[SPEAKER_06]: with all the trimming records,
data collection, analysis on breeding and
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotype characterization.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would bury that in the woods and
literally have to hike 15 minutes any time
[SPEAKER_06]: we wanted to see a note on a phenotype the
next time we're making a breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: selection round.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the thing is, it's a big discussion of
how do we know what varieties are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow best in what regions?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of like this is brand new.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to bring farmers together and
compare notes for this area versus this
[SPEAKER_06]: area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, there's going to be some
science that's going to need to be applied
[SPEAKER_06]: to it, which is a very difficult thing for
growers to start to get into that notion
[SPEAKER_06]: of applying science to their their
intuition, which has come from their
[SPEAKER_06]: instinct and intuitive experience and
relationship with the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a whole new spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the first part of it is
starting to characterize these genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: beyond like, oh, is it Indica sativa or
hybrid or it grows like this?
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get into what are the textures
to the flavor profiles and the details of
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabinoids and the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do those cannabinoids and terpenes
grow in different regions for what
[SPEAKER_06]: reasons?
[SPEAKER_06]: And beyond that, just characterizing,
you know, the vigor, the structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it symmetrical?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it elongated?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there, you know, a redness to the stem?
[SPEAKER_06]: All that needs to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the next step of cannabis
genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's intense and it's interesting because,
you know, cannabis growers sometimes are,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, people who keep to themselves
and are way out in the hills, starting to
[SPEAKER_06]: interact with attorneys, you know,
people who have that experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the next step is coming
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is when you take people from
outside of cannabis, you always need to
[SPEAKER_06]: question their intentions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are they doing this and what do they
want out of this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, everybody wants to support
their families and make a living.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is going to be people who come
in from outside industries with the
[SPEAKER_06]: intentions of I want to help these people
preserve their work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to help them do it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also need to be careful for people
who are coming into it for the wrong
[SPEAKER_06]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about trust issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to talk about trust, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we got some serious, there's some
serious trust problems in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, before we go into protecting
genetic, you have a pool of genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: is unique and amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem that that pool of genetic are
in drawers and you're growing whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing down south, which you
shouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're growing sun-grown genetic,
wedding cake and all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else and his brother is growing
and you're competing with the same genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: with indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the solution because you have
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you could go back and take what you
have in your cupboard and then took all
[SPEAKER_00]: those data of the old good old days and
bring back that genetics that created
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that we're actually smoking
today and that is weaker than their
[SPEAKER_00]: parents and grandparents and great,
great, great grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some things that is unique and
it's not really heirloom because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: let the seed spend the winter in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that full cycle of the genetic if
you really want your plant to become
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom and become the place where it
really grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to understand the value of that
genetic because like Jenin said,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first things basically that they did
in the wine industry when they created all
[SPEAKER_00]: those appellation is a classification of
quality so that when there is a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: of quality, what is the best of the best
growing in specific region, in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everything else that come into play
in your own region have to be able to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that is not those standards
have nothing to do in your territory so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the source of everything is you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so dependent on you, it's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a winemaker and I shouldn't even
have my name on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name on my packaging, the ash I made,
it's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was traveling in producing country,
nobody cared really much that I made the
[SPEAKER_00]: ash but they were asking me which valley,
which amlet, which altitude and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so much more value because beyond
the farmer, actually terroir is the land,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the climate, it's the genetic but
it's more than the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the community around the farmer
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer is the part of the osmosis but
that community around that farmer is super
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the quality literally of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you really have to realize
how valuable you are and how valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you have is and bring it back
on the market because that's what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: you different from anywhere in the world
and I've been in quite a few producing
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we, before diving into trust
issues, I want to take a minute to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Frenchy is probably the one of
the more, if not the most traveled
[SPEAKER_04]: Hachessin that I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to a handful of these countries
too also in my wanderings and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely true, you know, the diversity
here, the biodiversity, the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics, I agree, is step one.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the fact that there are so many
external threats to our genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to start by protecting what is
most threatened but I don't think by any
[SPEAKER_04]: means that genetics stands apart from the
other elements of what makes good cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think microclimate, climate is very
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think culture standards, the way that
the communities are structured,
[SPEAKER_04]: the way that we share information,
the way that we treat ideas, wisdom and
[SPEAKER_04]: experience as things that can raise
everybody as a whole as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: something to privatize and take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so again, it goes back to some of
those fundamental questions of how we
[SPEAKER_04]: structure social institutions and how we
structure our businesses, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: when we start to talk about the commercial
aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking specifically to genetics,
and I don't mean to be terribly doom and
[SPEAKER_04]: gloom, but climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: My, you know, my family is varietal of
Afghani that we've localized to our tiny
[SPEAKER_04]: little sliver of the midmahtal honeydew
dry creek, upper east branch of the dry
[SPEAKER_04]: creek if we get really technical about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That Afghani is not growing the same in
that watershed as it was when I was 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's been our family farm,
family ranch, whatever, since I was seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't grow the same there anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we're 30 generations deep into
it, but the climate is changing around us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's this impulse that I have to
preserve, protect and hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm finding myself very often needing
to focus on the mantra of adapt,
[SPEAKER_04]: evolve and flow as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nice that it takes so comfortably
to our culture, but I find sometimes that
[SPEAKER_04]: articulating these things really helps me
realize them and bring them into shared
[SPEAKER_04]: space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we do need to be attentive to the
changing conditions around us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, you know, just not to bring too
much politics in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know CDFW and the water board are
kicking our asses to some degree,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our culture and our processes need to
be adaptable enough to continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: persist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am incredibly thankful that cannabis is
so diverse that it expresses itself so
[SPEAKER_04]: many different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's frustrating that it
expresses itself so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really wanted those ones to be,
you know, that particular expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they weren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can be a drag, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have this very, very, very dynamic
core of genetic material, core of
[SPEAKER_04]: experience of narrative and culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And being able to both hold on to that and
preserve it and keep it safe and steward
[SPEAKER_04]: it, be the guardians of it like we've
always been while also acknowledging that
[SPEAKER_04]: the world is changing around us,
both regulatorily, commercially,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also just fundamentally
climatologically changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tricky, tricky intersection to be
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the community to be in that
crossroads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's let's keep at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't mean to derail from the trust
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to mention those few key
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to have this turn into a
conversation about trust instead of the
[SPEAKER_01]: topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it ties into the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think protecting genetics,
there is a need to reassess trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, one of the first in-person
client meetings I had with a nursery,
[SPEAKER_01]: the person I was meeting with told me that
he was evaluating whether to protect any
[SPEAKER_01]: of his cultivars, any of his genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that he had one that was
pretty valuable that he liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave some clones to somebody on
kind of a handshake agreement that this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy would pay him per clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he never saw any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: He figured that that particular strain
just never went anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using strain in the vernacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we can use cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not as obsessed with that as some
people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually going to update my blog
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said that a year later,
he saw that very cultivar in a catalog,
[SPEAKER_01]: his buddy's catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he called his friend and said,
hey, we had a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his friend said, you know,
I got employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got bills to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how things are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the end of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have a written agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have any IP protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thought he knew who he could trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know, you know, we're not here to
rehash phylos.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that you think you know who
you can trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then things change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorite breeders are the ones
that grew up breeding the plant in the 70s
[SPEAKER_01]: and 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you absolutely knew you couldn't trust
the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing you want to do is trust
the government to seek intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who grants intellectual property
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's time to just kind of reassess your
trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to tell you who to
trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying reassess your trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about who to trust.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a really great point.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to speak to that really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's as much about trust as
it is about, you know, what are our
[SPEAKER_09]: methodologies in place?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are our filters, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are our resources so that we have the
education and the understanding behind
[SPEAKER_09]: what the tools are that we can protect and
how to negotiate our contracts?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to give a shout out to the
trade associations because they're really
[SPEAKER_09]: here to serve you as an industry and
aggregate resources and bring that
[SPEAKER_09]: education and that knowledge base to
support your efforts in protecting your
[SPEAKER_09]: IP, developing your appellations,
and also navigating contracting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, who of us, you know, had so much
experience with contract law, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: prior to five years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a whole cultural transition in
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really looking to our local
associations, as the bedrock, to navigate
[SPEAKER_09]: and negotiate policy, contracts,
resources, research, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and looking, really doing our due
diligence as individuals and as
[SPEAKER_09]: communities and through our associations
to really vet, you know, what the tools
[SPEAKER_09]: are and the filters through which we're
pursuing our research and our data
[SPEAKER_09]: aggregation and our ownership.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, to that point,
I think is a really important thing to
[SPEAKER_09]: keep in mind as a resource and really
support, you know, your community through
[SPEAKER_09]: your trade associations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of good knowledge here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I respectfully agree with half of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I disagree with the other half.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to say that Hezekiah's
point on climate change is a really
[SPEAKER_06]: important factor because I've only been in
California for 10 years, 11 seasons that
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen fall harvests of, and I've seen
drastic changes in the way that varieties
[SPEAKER_06]: perform, you know, and every season is
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a hot September two years ago,
it was 95 plus degrees in my neighborhood
[SPEAKER_06]: for 21 days in September.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a delayed ripening,
you know, it's so the plants think that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the middle of the summer again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a real challenge to consider in
terms of the local trade organizations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, when someone starts devoting their
time to something, there's a purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's either a selfless purpose of giving
back or they want something out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be both.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the thing is, I think for those
trade organizations who want both,
[SPEAKER_06]: like Hezekiah grew up in southern
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to preserve the community in
southern Humboldt where I'm still a
[SPEAKER_06]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like I finally own my own
place.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my dream, but I still consider myself
an outsider because there's people who
[SPEAKER_06]: sacrificed way longer than I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with these trade associations,
there needs to be more inclusion of the
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers because how many of the farmers
actually have the information and how many
[SPEAKER_06]: of the people in the trade association
know all the information?
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, just go into the fun part and
talking about plants and genetics and
[SPEAKER_06]: preservation, because I thought it would
be a lot more fun to talk about weed and
[SPEAKER_06]: growing weed on this panel than,
you know, all the politics and trade
[SPEAKER_06]: association.
[SPEAKER_06]: So genetic preservation for the future in
terms of the breeding or, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: preservation of genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really, it's really two forms.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is through seed production and
selection in breeding programs,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is that's what I spent a lot of my
time daydreaming of since I was a little
[SPEAKER_06]: kid and, you know, really like to get into
and love to speak about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other is through clone propagation
and preservation.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when you look at what's happening
with the clones, like when you mentioned
[SPEAKER_06]: wedding cake, it's like something becomes
a popular variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: The market gets hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody gets it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets really oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't take good care of their
mothers, you know, and so there's always
[SPEAKER_06]: like the next greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's really special when you
find the varietals that have been,
[SPEAKER_06]: like you said, your family's been working
genetics for 30 years, the people who
[SPEAKER_06]: started bringing, you know, different
Afghanis into these regions when people
[SPEAKER_06]: just used to grow sativas that would come
in their bag seed that was shipped over by
[SPEAKER_06]: the megaton from South America and
Colombia and it never finished in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in terms of clonal propagation,
we now face all these new challenges with
[SPEAKER_06]: pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you compare it to other industries,
I think the banana industry is a really
[SPEAKER_06]: good comparison where there's like 10,000
varietals of bananas, but we only use
[SPEAKER_06]: three of them because most of them don't
store well.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to be shipped and transported
across all these countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happened, I believe it was in the
80s or 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm no expert.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may be completely misspeaking,
but basically a plant virus and pathogen
[SPEAKER_06]: wiped out a ton of the commercial produced
banana variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what Americans were eating as bananas
in the 50s is not what we eat as bananas
[SPEAKER_06]: because that species pretty much doesn't
exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It basically got taken out by a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the clones that we have,
from the time that I showed up,
[SPEAKER_06]: all these pests, you know, powder mildew,
russet mites, root aphids, and now,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, unidentified plant pathogens and
viruses are now present in our
[SPEAKER_06]: environment, which is also due to global
warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before I came here, I'd only seen
powder mildew once.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of my neighbors had never seen powder
mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard when they first started seeing it,
they thought they were crystals on the
[SPEAKER_06]: weed, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look, there's a university
study out of Mendocino from like 2011,
[SPEAKER_06]: 2012 that each year, the spore count for
powder mildew is dramatically increasing
[SPEAKER_06]: every single year in the environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So farmers have to be smarter about how to
prevent that and combat that by using,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, organic microbiology and living
soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the pathogens are really the biggest
risk because just, you know, let me think
[SPEAKER_06]: of how to phrase this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically all these clones that we
grow, they stay in people's mother rooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: People go through different treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with some of the best organic
practices, you can't prevent against
[SPEAKER_06]: certain bacterias.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's really important for us to
start working with science and thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: about micro propagation, which is
essentially tissue culture, where we can
[SPEAKER_06]: bank these genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: What can happen with technology is people
can clean the genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, I love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been growing it since 2002,
like back in the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an old clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been around since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kush is from the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any grower in here who's grown an SFV
clone, it's not fun or easy to grow
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's been passed around.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And imagine what's gotten into it in terms
of pathogen disease and viruses with
[SPEAKER_06]: tissue culture propagation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take that SFV clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be completely wiped clean,
remove all the bacteria, essentially
[SPEAKER_06]: disinfecting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you get those back in tissue
cultures, whether it's a mother or clones
[SPEAKER_06]: for propagation for for your cultivation,
it's clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like growing a seed for the very
first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's basically going to be through seed
production and proper preservation of
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding practices in terms of keeping
things preserved, but also maintaining the
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity that's in the genetics,
which is a very long conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in terms of clones starting to
work with micro propagation applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even if they're not going to be grown
out, you don't need to keep all these
[SPEAKER_06]: mothers around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can start every year producing
tissue culture mothers that start out with
[SPEAKER_06]: a clean slate.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's someone in northern Humboldt
that's been doing a lot of research on
[SPEAKER_06]: these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he showed me these graphs from field
research starting in 2009 through the
[SPEAKER_06]: present time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he started with a few areas where he
would test the tissue samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically you find these stunted
clones that basically take two or three
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks to get healthy to the point where
you can actually grow them effectively.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really talented growers find
themselves outgrowing this virus,
[SPEAKER_06]: outgrowing this pathogen by applying good
beneficial microbiology and good
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainable organic soils and practices
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still there when you get a clone
from somebody back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, man, like nine out of nine
point nine nine nine out of ten times the
[SPEAKER_06]: clone has issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this guy's research has actually
shown that he's discovered a virus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see on a graph we're starting
in 2010.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he founded on a few samples in
2011.
[SPEAKER_06]: He found more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then each year by 2012, 2013,
it was in every single sample of tissue
[SPEAKER_06]: that he took from clones of cannabis
plants from all around the emerald
[SPEAKER_06]: triangle between my area, island,
mountain, all over Mendocino and Trinity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of preservation, I do think we
need to we need to go to some greater
[SPEAKER_06]: minds from the scientific community and
work collaboratively so that we don't lose
[SPEAKER_06]: clone genetics because anybody who's a
grower or breeder in here has probably
[SPEAKER_06]: lost something special to them that you'll
never get back like a last of the Mohican
[SPEAKER_06]: variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really important for the future
to be able to preserve that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought it'd be more fun to talk
about weed and growing weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're we're kind of getting towards
the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to go ahead and open it up to
the audience.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have questions, shoot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, and Elaine from Dupont Farms and
Humble.
[SPEAKER_12]: We lost our mother a couple of years back.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then it opened up the conversation
with my father in law, who had been living
[SPEAKER_12]: in the Toll Valley for two decades.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was like, oh, yeah, I think I have
some seeds somewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about the drover.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a coffee can buried somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your question was legally, what's the
first step of protecting all those seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to start with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people wonder if what they have
is unique enough to protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the easiest answer is every single
every single seed you ever plant is unique
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just and that might sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, no matter how many children
my parents had, unless they're twins,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all unique enough to be different,
right, to be protectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, are we worth protecting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the real question is, if you have
something that if you have a seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have a plant that you've grown up,
is it worth commercializing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it not just is it going to be worth
commercializing for more than a few
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going to be worth commercializing
for more than a few seasons, then you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the question is, are you likely
to make your money selling clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: selling seeds or just selling harvested
material?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to sell flyers,
flower and you're never ever going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell plants, so never sell any kind of
propagating material, you could if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were positive that no genetic material
would ever slip out of your control,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't even need intellectual
property protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, nobody's ever positive that
that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're if you're never selling
clones or seeds, the best thing to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: the easiest, cheapest thing to do is get a
plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a copyright on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's really not that hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have a whole lot to get
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a couple of photos of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a name that isn't your trademark
name.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the cost on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: To get started, it costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's that's so it's likely not
worth the cost currently.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would recommend that you guys do if
it's important as a family heirloom,
[SPEAKER_06]: grow it out and do an open pollination and
make the next generation of seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: but do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the males, all the females call out
the weaker ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way you have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as your family continues to grow it
and if it's special to you and you keep it
[SPEAKER_06]: preserved over time, the the need and
value to protect the IP will come.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll happen if you prove it in market.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's just sacred for your family,
open pollinate it, preserve it,
[SPEAKER_06]: store those seeds properly, do it before
it's too late and you can't get them to
[SPEAKER_06]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe take some clone selections.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've all lost stuff due to human
error.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like, man, if you want
something right, do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it within your family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reproduce those seeds so you have the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Open pollinate, you know, call out any of
the weaker plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if it proves value in the market
at some point when people are starting to
[SPEAKER_06]: come for you to find it, then talk to some
lawyers, then look into protecting the IP.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too early to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I and I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to spend money on IP until
you know that you've got something
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're losing control of if you're
losing control of the genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when you it may already be too
late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just be careful about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you I have the next question because
it relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you patent a plant that is on
schedule one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't get the last part.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you patent a plant that is on
schedule one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent and Trademark Office is not
concerned at all about legacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about legality or even
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: They leave that to other agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been granting patents on illegal
and unsafe things throughout their entire
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_06]: So great news with plant patents.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like plant patents is like
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you're a grower, it's like who can
own a plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like that's how I feel
about, you know, all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like what is your entitlement to
owning this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when I first owned land, I never
thought that I would.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, man, I own this land.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I went to it and I stood there
and I go, I don't own this land.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't own a land.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't own land.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's my job to steward preserve
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just like like the Native Americans
and, you know, cultures throughout
[SPEAKER_06]: civilization, it's like if it's part of
nature, can we really own it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as you start to create and adapt
things that are more unique to you,
[SPEAKER_06]: that you put effort into, then you start
getting there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just think with plat with patenting
stuff, I mean, it's like I said,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of this is a new, intense discussion,
you know, but I think it's too early for
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis unless it's really proving an
application in market and there's a risk
[SPEAKER_06]: of it being infringed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to respectfully just point out
that people you don't own land because
[SPEAKER_01]: land is going to be there long after
you're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people do build fences around their
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stop people from building roads
across their land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stop people from moving on to their
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what a patent is,
a boundary around what you've created so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're free to do what you want to do
with what you've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can you can allow people to come
onto your land and to even live on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: to have parties on it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't exert control over your
land, it's not your land anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the same token, if you create some
great variety, you're free to do what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you utterly lose control of
that, it's not really yours to decide
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get a patent, and I'm not
absolutely most things that are ever
[SPEAKER_01]: created are not worth patenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you ever have something that really
is worth patenting and you don't patent
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you will lose your opportunity to be
the one that controls its destiny,
[SPEAKER_01]: its fate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like not putting a fence around
your land.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to thread a middle line here if
I could.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to prevent other people
from patenting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your stepfather, I think, happens to be
the source of my family's Afghani from
[SPEAKER_04]: several decades ago, coincidentally.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grew up very close to one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think we need to stop somebody
else from saying, no, this is mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm obviously a broken record.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really good at getting into obsessive,
obsessive grooves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my obsessive groove currently is
cooperative, cooperative ownership.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't own nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a silly concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of why things are so screwy in
the world today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do a better job of asserting
our responsibility to these varietals and
[SPEAKER_04]: our guardianship of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually owning it is very costly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree entirely with both of them that
it's too soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to start establishing benchmarks and
lines in the sand around these shared
[SPEAKER_04]: assets, around these things that these
courageous heroes brought to us from these
[SPEAKER_04]: land rights, this is a very real community
asset.
[SPEAKER_04]: And figuring out where to set the balance
between the individual and the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to sort of Frenchy's opening comments,
it's not just the farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the community around the farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, to me, is why I'm a broken
record.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another question from the audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what he said, I think, was really,
really valuable information is the main
[SPEAKER_06]: purpose of why people should protect is
who's going to steal it from you and who's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to take it from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're really correct on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the guy who didn't show up today
and all the controversy with that,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really hoping he was going to show
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to be very respectful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was going to really drop some
knowledge, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the deal is the roots of that go
very deep.
[SPEAKER_06]: This didn't just happen with this phylos
thing in the last six months or in the
[SPEAKER_06]: last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: That organization and that entity started
in 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Robert Clark and Sam the Skunkman
went onto these online forums of
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivators and started asking to collect
people's genetic specimens of land race,
[SPEAKER_06]: local varietals, even in seed form that
they thought couldn't germinate.
[SPEAKER_06]: They still wanted that for what they were
calling a worldwide classification
[SPEAKER_06]: program.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is all documented.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find it all online.
[SPEAKER_06]: So phylos was involved in all of this back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my question was, who's paying for
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is some really forward
thinking technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: So who's putting up the money for that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you really start diving in,
I mean, I don't care that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you really look into it,
there's ties between executives at GW
[SPEAKER_06]: Pharmaceuticals to that whole structure of
entities at that time that was really
[SPEAKER_06]: ahead of everyone being like, look,
let's just get as much genetic information
[SPEAKER_06]: as we can into our pockets so that we can
hopefully be the ones to start adapting
[SPEAKER_06]: biopharmaceutical products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you think about the forward future of
the industry, we are going to learn
[SPEAKER_06]: certain cannabinoids and terpenes that we
don't even understand yet in combinations
[SPEAKER_06]: might cure diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have incredible medical
applications that can better humanity.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's going to be biopharmaceutical,
geoengineering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the companies who have the
applications and the ability to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's a very mixed thing about how I
feel the emotions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in terms of people who want our
genetics, all of the biggest agricultural
[SPEAKER_06]: companies in the entire world,
Bayer, Sygenta, Monsanto, Cargill,
[SPEAKER_06]: every one of them, when people talk about,
oh, Marlboro, Philip Morris is buying up
[SPEAKER_06]: land, people talked about that 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were probably doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're smart, forward thinking,
massive conglomerates that can control the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole world on some conspiracy stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is what we do need to protect
ourselves from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like those people are coming into
this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been doing it for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were smart and they stayed real
silent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now some of it is bubbling up,
but who knows where they've been investing
[SPEAKER_06]: and figuring out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the thing is, can growers like
us, can we do all that stuff without
[SPEAKER_06]: joining them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's like, you don't want to join
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't beat them, do you have to
join them?
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the conversation in terms of
protecting our genetics, which was really
[SPEAKER_06]: smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, it's too early for us to go
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have the funds, but we need to
make sure that someone else doesn't steal
[SPEAKER_06]: your family's life's work, because there's
people already trying to do things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're going to impose a
lightning round rule for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so let's take another question from
the audience.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's go with Frank.
[SPEAKER_07]: The
[SPEAKER_07]: seed and tissue culture bank that
everybody basically owns on a nonprofit
[SPEAKER_07]: level, that's the way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to really preserve those
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenchy, hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paraphase the question for the video
folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a way to collectively or broken
record cooperatively own a seed and
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics bank?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if Philo had put all the data
they had taken from everything that was
[SPEAKER_00]: given to you available for the public,
then it's OK to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody has access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's really worthwhile, because like
Ezekiah said, that plant is way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: possessing it while you need to protect
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dealing with an entity that puts it
available to the public, it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it personally because Robert Clark,
that I respect a lot, asked me to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: to give sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam the skunk man sent me DM personally to
ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowgli asked me to ask you personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love you to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need you like nobody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cannot give, I cannot trust to that
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I cannot give my word and take
something from you that I know is so
[SPEAKER_00]: precious and give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it to an entity when I'm not sure
that those data are available for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a planted question, I swear.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it might as well have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our dear colleague Casey isn't here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a wedding to go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the first things that Casey did
back in 2014 with Emerald Grown were a
[SPEAKER_04]: mutual benefit, meaning all of our assets
can only be used for the common benefit of
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the members, was start a seed bank
and a free open swap and exchange seed
[SPEAKER_04]: bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been a tough time for growers the
last couple years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been about as spread thin as we can
be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're turning the corner on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're moving into an era where
we will have the capacity to formalize
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these institutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to talking to the
colleague here about how those types of
[SPEAKER_04]: cooperative ownership structures might
help serve us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But making sure that our community
protects our common assets from the
[SPEAKER_04]: oncoming threats is, I think, the bottom
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your question is spot on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there is a way to structure that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there is a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important that it's
possible to collectivize individual IP
[SPEAKER_01]: assets and put them into a pool that can
be asserted as a defense if anybody gets
[SPEAKER_01]: taken on by Big Ag that the collective
could kind of form a counterbalance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's an important point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's a really excellent
point.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to your point around trade
associations, I think just like any
[SPEAKER_09]: partnership, if you're working with a
company, you're working with an
[SPEAKER_09]: institution, you're working with trade
associations, it's about standards,
[SPEAKER_09]: standards of how we do business,
standards of what our agreements are.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's up to all of us to do our
due diligence and really follow the money.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is the money coming from?
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we evaluating this data?
[SPEAKER_09]: How is data moving forward?
[SPEAKER_09]: And how is that piece coming back to the
community?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think that is everyone's
individual job to really do that due
[SPEAKER_09]: diligence and really look at who we're
partnering with and really what are the
[SPEAKER_09]: tools we're working with and where's the
balance of how we're exchanging resources
[SPEAKER_09]: in that context.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're about 20 minutes over time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can keep it going.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're down to keep going.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's telling us to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go ahead with one more question.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's not even a question.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's a scary thing,
again, going like,
[SPEAKER_11]: use that data for knowledge and start
there when you're compiling it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't accept no for an answer.
[SPEAKER_11]: How does people partner with
[SPEAKER_11]: you?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a question up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're calling him.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is kind of also more of a comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm growing bits.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also more in your wheelhouse
view.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to look into participatory
plant breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of data on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of information out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look it up, PPVs, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need the farmers association,
the farmers to get together with the
[SPEAKER_08]: Appalachia groups.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need those cultivars that you've got to
get in and protected in the Appalachians
[SPEAKER_08]: of origin as our cultivars, as historical
representations of what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: protect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if we can't get it into the patent
system, and even if that's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_08]: the greatest value added or money
proposition, we need to figure out
[SPEAKER_08]: multiple strategies that start with
farmers working with local breeders,
[SPEAKER_08]: collecting all that data, and using our
local trade associations and all this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to get over differences.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all sorts of camps going back
decades in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_08]: We fight incessantly, and we got to get
over that shit because Dale's article was
[SPEAKER_08]: incredibly good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Trevor.
I
[SPEAKER_02]: agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you restate the question so they can
all hear?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she was saying, how can we develop
those processes of getting the communities
[SPEAKER_06]: and the farms together with some of the
organizations or companies that actually
[SPEAKER_06]: have the resources or assets to help
collect all this data and use it
[SPEAKER_06]: responsibly to benefit everyone in the
right ways with positive intentions?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's already happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: This discussion is a part of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your organization, which has done really
amazing work and come up into my
[SPEAKER_06]: neighborhood and gotten people to show up
at the firehouse who would never even
[SPEAKER_06]: consider showing up at a meeting like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about dialogue, reaching out to each
other and connecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing about weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed culture used to be like you had to be
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now everybody thinks they're in it and
they're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely about a dialogue.
[SPEAKER_06]: The folks who have the resources and the
assets need to reach out to the
[SPEAKER_06]: communities or the leaders of those
communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dialogue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a discussion and starting more
meetings and organizations because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: one of my missions.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much crazy, cool seed genetics
that I haven't even seen people produce in
[SPEAKER_06]: five or six years and all these people
that have these collections.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see those come back into the
light.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want people to see the amazing terpenes
that they've never experienced.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it already is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just encouraging people to
collaborate and be selfless in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: let's just have more conversations like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two really firm strategies and two
things we need to be absolutely mindful of
[SPEAKER_04]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: First and foremost, the reason the
Appalachian law notes varietal is because
[SPEAKER_04]: the intention is to document, catalog,
and snapshot where we are now in the
[SPEAKER_04]: public record.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a public asset.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't undo that document and library
except maybe Eleanor might correct me.
[SPEAKER_04]: First and foremost, public.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it is a public institution,
it is for the public benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, ownership and control.
[SPEAKER_04]: How the company is structured.
[SPEAKER_04]: A private company can and will liquidate
assets.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, the farmers, don't own the company
in part, it's probably not going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: your interests at heart at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, the farmers don't have the
capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: Structuring partnerships very,
very carefully between farmer and financer
[SPEAKER_04]: is the way to move forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the bottom line, communal farmer
ownership doesn't exist, it's probably not
[SPEAKER_04]: a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Public ownership, farmer ownership,
cooperative, shared ownership are very
[SPEAKER_04]: important strategies and structures to
really trust at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want recognition because when
what you give us extractor, everybody in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, what we receive,
we owe it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't receive credit for what you
give us, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to create a market
where the credit is given back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: origin of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most extractor, if you do a web pen and
yeah, you want to do big number,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you buy your biomass in Salinas
or when you buy your biomass in Mando or
[SPEAKER_00]: Rimbolt, it's not quite the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite the same biomass and
because you have a world recognition,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to work this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world knows that you grow the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be aware of that when you sell
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already you sell it too cheap,
but on top of it, they don't give you
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for the quality that they recognize
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you need at least to ask for
your name on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care if it's a web pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care if it's a chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from your farm and that name on
the packaging is actually a promotion and
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketing worldwide power for all
those companies that feed on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like it's you need to protect
yourself, but you need to be aware of the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of what you protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no deal that doesn't give you
credit back because you're the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: that new industry being born.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeder and the grower need to become
the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the whole life giver and life
nourishing of the land and the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We coexist with them and can create
something that is different and better
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just visitor, but when you buy a
great cheese, a great wine, any great
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural product, it's that place
because that's the amazing value of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That world living soil and being in
osmosis where what you live, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: he make quality that you cannot duplicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think appellation in the future is going
to be something you have to wear whether
[SPEAKER_03]: or not you want to or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea of an appellation of origin of
Merced County around all the 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, monocroft chemical agents
destroy the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: The baggage left behind the legacy of ag
and a lot of these counties were kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: just a mega fraud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like going for what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pulling up, telling the full story through
the regulation of testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show the legacy of the land baggage or the
perfect wild conditions for the
[SPEAKER_03]: appellation and then that's where you see
the expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shared practices.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the statute.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have another panel coming up in two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to have to wrap this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really thank everyone for spending extra
time to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's give a big round.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, lastly, I did bring some seeds to
gift to some folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't bring enough for everybody,
but I have some seeds from my collection.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just leave them here if anybody wants
some free seeds as a gift for showing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
I'll see you next time.
