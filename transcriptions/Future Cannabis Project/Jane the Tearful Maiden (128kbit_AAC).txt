[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so so it's commonly known that That
in in in full variables that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 136 original land races from
around the world and Within about 400
[SPEAKER_00]: years that tripled Because of cross
pollination due to you know regions that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were growing in and so on so forth
And that's why you get some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdowns of the different types of
Afghani or the different You know your
[SPEAKER_00]: base sativas and so on so forth One of the
one of the pure strains that I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: locate was called La Juanita Lagrimosa
Jane the tearful maiden I went over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent 90 days over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with a cultivator just outside of
Barcelona He actually gave me the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: history of that strain and it dates back
to the plague first first getting to Spain
[SPEAKER_00]: and None in a cloister had been growing
the La Juanita.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they used it as natural medicine It
was it grew inside the I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you call it the courtyard of of that of
that convent there and When she saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of the plague in the fisherman's
village She went up there and stripped all
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves off the plant boiled them in
water and went down and served That tea to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone Okay, only people who died from
the plague during that period of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation Were the people who did not
drink the tea who refused to drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it was a devil's You know
thing okay, so and and the preservation of
[SPEAKER_00]: that was actually carried on through the
religious sect not so much as the common
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, you know having it available to
them and When villagers got sick,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would go to see the nuns the nuns
would take care of them But the the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of the strain actually came because of the
woman She was beheaded, you know by the
[SPEAKER_00]: king of Spain for for healing those people
there was a land deal involved and they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed the villages cleared out so that
they could build a French port and
[SPEAKER_00]: Isabella would have married the king of
Spain at that time and It was at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: that they found out that this woman
altered their plans and there's a famous
[SPEAKER_00]: painting that it was done of the woman
hanging upside to her body upside down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the form of a cross and her head in the
spike right next to it, but the cloister
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the background of the painting and
in the window You will see the hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent sativa leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was tripled tripled to quadrupled
so so in From well that would be from
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're we're talking About 400 years
because you have to remember hemp was in
[SPEAKER_00]: huge production back at the beginning and
establishment of this country So we had
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds coming in from all over all the
European continents, you know between
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain You know and Ireland Scotland every
place that they you know, even Rome Italy
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy was known for high some of the best
highest grade hemp available for making
[SPEAKER_00]: you know for clothing and For sales so you
think about a lot of the strains that that
[SPEAKER_00]: were crossed into the original land races
were hemp That were crossed into it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where you'll find variations when
you do a hundred seeds You can find a
[SPEAKER_00]: variation of a seed that gives you a
higher CBD value to it So it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you get the plant to this tall
that you take a cut of it Grow it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know do it do a quick flower of it and
get a CBD value on it Get your THC values
[SPEAKER_00]: find out what your CBG values are,
you know with having the laboratories
[SPEAKER_00]: available to us that we have today We
should be able to break down All of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual cannabinoids to a point where
there's not an illness on this planet that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't fix You know, I Think when the
creator reached his finger down and
[SPEAKER_00]: touched a spot and the first cannabis
plant grew he knew exactly what he was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing Okay, and up until man got in the
way in 1928 man got in the way Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think our federal government
should collect any taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think our state should collect any
taxes I don't think our police department
[SPEAKER_00]: should be using any money raised from this
Okay, because they lied to you for 75
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lied to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took this out of a doctor's hands
Okay, so That they could push a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry that has done
nothing but cause harm and cause macular
[SPEAKER_00]: degeneration to the human genetic That is
today and we need to take it back My
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama red came out like Panama red And
I'm talking 1974 1975 Panama red and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you came out to the farm I would smoke
some with you and you'd be you'd be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: you met Panama red Okay, it's a this is
the one thing you know the the the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between Okay, when you put a
plant outside for the first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay generally within seven to nine days
it starts to You know, you're you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get your boost growth and
everything But it can take you up to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: days to finally get a sex on that plant
unless you're using something like phylos
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but I can't recommend the
laboratories for sexing Okay, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: point that I thought I could But I cannot
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an 80% you know success,
you know rate No is 80% success rate with
[SPEAKER_00]: getting females Out of the seeds that we
were you know that we were that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: germinating For the first two years,
but as soon as the recreational kicked in
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody was doing it I think time
Became a constraint again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It boils down to profit last year's test
results Were 90% inaccurate 90% Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you think about that I grow for 23
patients that we have cards for Everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else gets their medicine for free all the
excess that we grow on our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell plants That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will never see my buds You'll see my
strains in the dispensary any of you if
[SPEAKER_00]: any of you have ever smoked or consumed
the strawberry express That was designed
[SPEAKER_00]: for adult seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works I created it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I worked my ass off in order to do it
And I don't care who takes credit for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the original name was strawberry
choo-choo, but they wouldn't let me use
[SPEAKER_00]: choo-choo It was a it's a Mazara Sharif.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the land race of Saudi Arabia
crossed with the time wreck from Southern,
[SPEAKER_00]: California That's a natural grown
mountainside plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then infused with Kyle Cushman
strawberry cough Okay, I went from having
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 seizures a day to maybe two maybe three
And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now after continued use I make an RSO
from it I do a quarter gram of it every
[SPEAKER_00]: morning and I haven't had a seizure,
you know, well, I haven't won
[SPEAKER_00]: periodically, you know, and it's generally
due to stress when I get overexcited but
