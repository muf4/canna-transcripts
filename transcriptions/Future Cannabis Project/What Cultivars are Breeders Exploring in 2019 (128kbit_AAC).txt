[SPEAKER_03]: You're all working on interesting stuff,
and I know some of the work you're doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: all three of you, but you're always
constantly refining and switching process.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's something you're excited about this
year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's for the market or not,
but what's something you're into yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're working with, you'd like to
see people access in any form?
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, so many things, but I want to say on
what Jason had brought up and what me and
[SPEAKER_04]: Gene brought up, Beth, did you speak this
weekend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Beth Schechter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the Open Cannabis Project looks
to protect the cultivar, the strains that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're all known and loved for a long time,
and hopefully combinations of all of them,
[SPEAKER_04]: so that we can all keep doing the work
that we've been doing, breeding and
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivating, and it's a non-profit
organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely going to be some big
bad wolves coming to get genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You hide them away?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't come to an event like this and say,
here, have a few of this and a few of
[SPEAKER_04]: that, because maybe there's somebody in
the room or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost impossible, and so we just got
to support an organization like that is
[SPEAKER_04]: really the best way that we can keep
cannabis open source and keep the genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis accessible to everybody,
because the Syngentes and the Monsantos
[SPEAKER_04]: would like to just tie up all of these
strains, and of course, there's this
[SPEAKER_04]: phenomena that's unusual, where something
has been under prohibition, since in all
[SPEAKER_04]: of modern times, has been basically
illegal, so any innovation that has
[SPEAKER_04]: happened has not been documented,
because just like at Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_04]: Company, we'd keep freaking notes during
the breeding season, and then burn them in
[SPEAKER_04]: the fall, because it was like,
I'm not trying to keep notes around about
[SPEAKER_04]: how many goddamn plants I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: A charge enhancement back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: A charge enhancement.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were in the game, I caught an extra
couple years on a case I had to fight,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I had spreadsheets comparing
operations, and it gave me a criminal
[SPEAKER_03]: mastermind charge, and we all laughed,
and I said, if I was so smart,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't get fucking caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nonetheless, the enhancement was really
punishing, because I was using tools to
[SPEAKER_03]: document work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was impossible to keep this much data
when you're running this many operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my hand in a lot of cookie jaws way
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those folks that look to capitalize so
much could easily come in and try to say
[SPEAKER_04]: that they've created something that's new,
when really, Mean Gene's been breeding it
[SPEAKER_04]: for 20 goddamn years, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good organization to support.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate what Beth's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as some exciting stuff that we're
doing, I think really that big phenotype
[SPEAKER_04]: hunt effort was exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to release the product this
year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be dropping the selected cuts,
like Daniel's farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We picked one that we're calling Magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Magic Melon, and that one just really
smells like melons, and it's kind of gassy
[SPEAKER_04]: fuel finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel really just happy to be able to
work in cannabis and share the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely, I got an email the other day,
and I looked at the email, and I thought
[SPEAKER_04]: it was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: It said burpee in the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I replied to the email and did some
fishing, and sure enough, it was burpee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they big bad wolf or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't follow the corporate ladder all
the way up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of stuff that's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely be careful, but we got to keep
charging forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting things, just breeding more and
more all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing some genotyping and putting it
in the public space.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a way that you can, once you do
that, if you don't patent it in a year,
[SPEAKER_04]: then it becomes public domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would call defensive IP
versus offensive IP, which is getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: patent and sending out cease and desist
letters to everybody in the room who
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't pay you a fee for growing it or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying I'm completely opposed to
patents, but I think definitely that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a slippery slope.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of things out there that
should just be public domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could just take a snapshot of the
whole cannabis space right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure that that could continue to be
the way it is and people could continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a good thing to do,
but it costs a lot of money to genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the only solution too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I'm excited about the weeping
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, though, we're all in the
real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone in the room is in the real.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is the struggle because that's
so much the reality of what you're having
[SPEAKER_03]: to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to make sure, though,
is that the things that you see and that
[SPEAKER_03]: interest you, because you guys are the
painters that create the ink that we use
[SPEAKER_03]: to do our work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You broke out the melon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing was, you say, hey, no,
what we found was something that was
[SPEAKER_03]: unbelievably Melanie with the beautiful
fuel back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think it would be attractive and it
would be valuable for the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm seeking from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part about us all struggling is as
real as it can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to make light of it because
otherwise you go home and cry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tissue paper is expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, Big Gene?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you messing around with?
[SPEAKER_03]: What direction do you go with your lines?
[SPEAKER_03]: You work some lines that you've had for a
long time, but you switch the direction on
[SPEAKER_03]: them and it's neat because it lets you
swing a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'd really like to do is I'll do
those fresh hybrids and then try to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through and seed a lot of plants every
time I do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can go in all these different
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make that fresh hybrid,
if stuff is fairly consistent you start
[SPEAKER_01]: with, then you get a pretty, it's pretty
predictable to know what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you make that F2, you get all
the weirdness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you get all the weirdness,
then that's where you can really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make one thing into a million
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some of them, I've tried to take them
different directions and then some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: is just a real clear direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year I'm really trying to work on the
root beer stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool because it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: With doing seeds, there's a whole lot of
seeds that are really interesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all are really valid in the space as
far as going, okay, we need to have all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a trip because when you go to
actually sell a lot of weed, it has to
[SPEAKER_01]: look a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has to be something about it where
it's like, okay, that's shiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really like a little color to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to at least have a silver look if
not dark or purple or blue or red or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular green bud better be really tasty
and really stinky to be able to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root beer is a cool one because of the
way it smokes, the way it grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year I'm trying to do, I got back
crossed to that clone twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original mail I started with was
almost the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very pretty consistent right away
and then going back to it a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: times made it really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what I'm going to try to do with that
is I'll probably go back one more time to
[SPEAKER_01]: the root beer clone to make it so that
it's really root beer seed because it has
[SPEAKER_01]: got more and more frequent when you back
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too inconsistent, it throws too
much weird stuff, but it comes through so
[SPEAKER_01]: it dominates in the crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I'm going to do while it's
still just a little more open at the two
[SPEAKER_01]: back crosses, I'm probably going to do a
bunch of out crosses of it this year and
[SPEAKER_01]: then do the same thing with the cherry
limeade.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason being that if you go to get
clones from somebody, you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's cool to have some like,
okay, I'm going to have some of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when people want units and weight of
something, you have to be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that people look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they don't know the name,
it's recognizably what they is in their
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm of what's the dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best weed might look like
shoelaces and be all messed up and look
[SPEAKER_01]: like Dr. Greenspoon or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you really want something that
you can have in your bag, people go,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, you just want that instant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things that do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You open the bag, I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to do that because when you
want to have plants that grow well for you
[SPEAKER_01]: as a farmer and then you need a product
that's really going to be that thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the whole thing I was talking
about with brand recognitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: People go, oh, it's hype, it's hype,
it's hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, hype doesn't last.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when cookies came out,
it was like, that's hype, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, maybe it's not as good,
it's not as strong as headband or cam or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever is your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it was just hype, it wouldn't be
here 10 years after I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still here and all the crosses are
still that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you really get into it, you go,
okay, this is cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why it's valuable to grow
it is because when you finish it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a tomato farmer, most people are
going to wind up like, okay, this one has
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf life, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, we're going to grow these Romas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to grow these really cool heirloom
rainbow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you go in the store, there's only
a little bit of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, you got this whole tier of
these Romas over here, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: beef steaks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need things to fit in people's
paradigms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to put out some stuff that's
really like, people go, oh, it's the hype
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's another gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this or it's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a trip because if you don't have
something that people on a knee-jerk
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction will look at and go, that's the
stuff, that's what everybody wants,
[SPEAKER_01]: then do you really want to have 350 pounds
of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a quarter pound for your
head or whatever to share and maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: got somebody who wants this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just trying to really make sure
that the stuff that I'm putting out is
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that when you're done with it,
it's what people come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like this last stuff I released was
like I had that pina, the pina a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times a CBD plant, but it's super hardy,
its structure's great, it will not get PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy and such a great,
you could probably dry farm it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have seen my buddy leave the pina
cross cherries that I made in some three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots, basically in a greenhouse
that wasn't being grown in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like 130 degree desert in there
every day and the plants, he watered them
[SPEAKER_01]: when they were starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never grew, but then they budded and
they finished and there was this killer
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in there that we basically found
going to his house and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that's got value too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's weed that when people,
originally I was like it's CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: people only want Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have a little bit of it, people would
show up and they'd be like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want more of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something, trying to put stuff
out that's actually can really be
[SPEAKER_01]: practical for people that are farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the sky cuddler Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Nikona's favorite weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the knee jerk, okay, this is
cool, I understand it, it smells gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a grower too, it's really
performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just the focus of the stuff that
I'm working on in general is to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the lime and the lime is great,
but the lime is a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little more leafy when you grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to work it into a little bit
more different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like cross it back with an OG,
keeps the nose, gets a little meat on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the lime pop Kush is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the huge plants if you're growing
big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I made, I took the cherry limeade
F5 and I put it on gelato, sherb,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you're like, oh, that's a
stupid, but it's like, yeah, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what people want in their bag to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta have that, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the stuff I've been
trying to work on more stuff that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same time, I'm always
doing my regular stuff that's for me that
[SPEAKER_01]: I vibe with even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't help but also vibe with
something that you look at it and you go,
[SPEAKER_01]: whoa, well, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I went to the ego clash in Hoplin
down there and I saw all the stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, I walked up and they go,
which one would you say would be good out
[SPEAKER_01]: of there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I missed the part where you smoke and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just looked in the case and I was,
oh, that number 14, that looks like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: fire right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is, but it looks
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that good old school gany,
frosted up look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they announced the winner and
they're like, oh, the number 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of 41 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, all right,
well, I mean, you can't really argue with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't just hype, cookie, strain,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't argue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I learned that from a guy that was
in fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've not historically been known as
someone who's been fashionable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I asked people who are fashionable
about fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, you can't argue with trends
that people do because what you're saying
[SPEAKER_03]: is that you're not intelligent enough to
recognize that they made the choice to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what happens is you cut yourself
right out of the trend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the same with what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants at the bottom line is if 41 cut
wasn't hot, then why is it moving at a
[SPEAKER_03]: rate that's supernatural?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't mean you need to jump on
it, but you need to understand why,
[SPEAKER_03]: the why.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I learned from someone is there's two
things in life, those that know how and
[SPEAKER_03]: those that know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those that know how work for those
that know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for us, it's the why that's what's
important for us, otherwise we end up just
[SPEAKER_03]: being how do we make it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to understand why are we
making it and what is that direction?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see all these modern cultivars that are
red hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them aren't my personal
preference, but I don't deny the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: it moves at an unbelievable velocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you do objective testing where I
take things that I think are hot and I
[SPEAKER_03]: give them to people who are in markets
that are unbelievably picky and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: money, which means they have access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I let them run them to find out,
compared to each other, which one has the
[SPEAKER_03]: velocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it lets me really understand of
these elites, which one really is the
[SPEAKER_03]: attraction and why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also lets me understand which ones
didn't I think had the attraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, whoa, the market still likes
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so much of it is that visual
appearance and you've been trained to
[SPEAKER_03]: choose those things because that's what
we've got the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always tell people some of the
strongest part of a smoke that looked like
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a piece of cabbage run over by a
tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got me so high that I had to drive
around the island three times because I
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't figure out how to get off the
highway on the on-ramp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was out in Hawaii and I got so lit
that I couldn't really get off the
[SPEAKER_03]: freeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said, screw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just drive it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point I'll come down and I'll
be able to figure out how do you get off
[SPEAKER_03]: the freeway?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't laughing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, whoa, I am scorched.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I could get my hands on that again,
I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing was, I challenge you to sell
it because it looked like it was some
[SPEAKER_03]: cabbage run over by a tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's like, oh yeah,
gelato, just gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I made a gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a sherb cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the male I started with though was an
F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those generations to get to F3 took a
while out of the twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get to the four took a while out of the
threes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I just went one,
two, three, four, five, boom, gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even that is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going along the way to go,
OK, cool, we got rid of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think you probably grew some of
the early cherry generations that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: that have all the weird urkel recessives
in it that pop out with a little duck
[SPEAKER_01]: foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they won't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weed is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to get both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so now, like I have cherry lime
F6s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you grow those, they're all big,
fast vegging plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have the same bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have the super high 5% terpenes
at SC.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18, 22% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't care if it's windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then take that, like what I used to
make that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out crossed to these height, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then with that, then you at least
know you've got some predictability there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, you have
marketability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's only so many enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of us enthusiasts can go ahead and
go, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is this really rare weed thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb right now is working with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian bastard cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, why would you want
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, if you really like plants,
you want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not the other one you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not going to go, OK,
I'm going to switch over my hoops to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to go, once it's trimmed
in the bag, it probably isn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the leaves are cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the leaves are what's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has valuable things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to have it in your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked right at it and went,
if I can get a plant that's like a bomb
[SPEAKER_01]: ass Afghani to grow with this size leaves,
you're going to have yields that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to crush everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you can get a fat bud on
something that veges faster than that with
[SPEAKER_01]: a tiny little leaf, it's just going to get
sun right to the bud the whole way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have these huge buds
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of being on the end with these
big fat leaves that block everything out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have them six feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you get like the cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things are valuable for
breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you buy a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, dude, I want to grow this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I want to find a clone or I just
want to grow these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just have good bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to make sure that my seed,
you plant a row of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be able to plant a row of it and
have 10 or 20 of them and hundreds or 300s
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at them and go, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I grew that in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I try to put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the new stuff, too, I'm trying to
make sure it's always the cutting edge
[SPEAKER_01]: terps and something that fits into the
picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pre-marketed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to make it smart business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was saying about to loop
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's cool about the root beer is it
almost looks like a cookies or it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's because it has black aphi in it
way back in it in Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has the headband, the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush, like Mandel had back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes it like this ultra potent
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're used to smoking cookies and
you smoke this, you're like, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is super satisfying smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it breaks up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got, you know, just really
killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are those are ones that are that
are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maintaining those cool, that cool,
all that neat stuff and then being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: go, OK, here's what we need to be
competitive, because we do have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: super competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you really need is a plant that is
that special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people will go, OK, I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for everyone to share
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for everyone to share,
especially these bulk, these these bulk
[SPEAKER_01]: gene pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like if you have your own clone and
everyone's like, oh, you can't get like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you don't want to give that clone
away because maybe you want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you're like, no,
I know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might talk to someone's grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, sorry, you can't have my
cookie recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because it's I want to have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to win the I want to win the
contest at the whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever it's for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a there's a there's something
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like definitely everyone's
got to share but there's a there's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: edge to being able to go, OK, I have this
thing and I'm the only one with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something for everyone to think
about that find that plant where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you you're you might not be able
to sell SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, I was getting,
you know, three grand for this SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people want to give me six hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's crashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you go to talk to somebody and
they're like, dude, I have this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter what, everybody my buddy's
got this Vermont diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like pre sour diesel diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I don't know if it really
is, but that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like just straight, like super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then underneath, it's just like clove.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super, super bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just calls it diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody who looks at that and they
tell you, oh, sorry, this is good indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm only going to give you a thousand
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the next guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one out of three people who smell
this shit are going to say, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if I have that, I can sell that to
people for whatever I want to ask for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just because people don't all
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everyone has it, people see a bad
version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all of a sudden, it's whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's definitely like a value in
that of looking for your own thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: having it and, you know, being able to
being able to run with something that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, got a little edge on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so that that's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always doing trying to make stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like when I look around
this room, I think what the reality is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that so many of us, like if you think
of it's a race or whatever, a racetrack,
[SPEAKER_04]: so many of us are actually like lapping
the whole industry that it's easy to look
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're really all just like so far
ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like what Gene was saying is like
sometimes you got to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: give them what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, you do a few gelato
crosses or make sure everything is,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a certain THC level for for the
year, but never ever give up on those
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars that like that mean everything
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't like back got eight,
nine years ago, people would give me such
[SPEAKER_04]: a hard time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, why do you have seeds that make
purple cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everybody hates purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, oh, it's it's because it's
deficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your your weeds purple because it's
deficient in whatever something they tell
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd be like, no, it's it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is like so the trends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the whole lapping thing like
we're always like one lap ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it can look like we're kind
of behind the pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, we're just like ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody knows it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think just for Gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got you got a lot of killer stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You you you work some interesting
directions since I've met you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that, you know, you've been
you've been really putting together some
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting combinations and the number of
people that bring me material that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some in my job right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone said, man, I got some killer
equilibrium working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I laugh because each one of those
samples was radically different than the
[SPEAKER_03]: other because the lines were different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I I like that when I see people have
separation in what they're doing and your
[SPEAKER_03]: desires to go these different trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you've been you've been put some
cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I think this year I'm going to try to
dig deeper into I've got so many seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: so many things I've collected over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of want to I like that
branching out in a whole new direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like kind of out sideways somewhere
where maybe it's something that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on the shelf that I've been
meaning to get to forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't decided anything I'm going
to work with yet this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's there's a few contenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Malawi Lions did really well,
you know, over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of people coming back
saying the African orange was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that was really mold resistant for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some of the flowers that
somebody, you know, brought me some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers today from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was just probably one of the
most citrusy versions of African orange
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's certainly a direction I want to
go in as things that do well on the coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've been in, you know,
I was in Santa Cruz for so many years and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's hard to grow almost anything in
a lot of the areas around that county.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually where I first saw some
Mean Genes work as I had a friend out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that we kind of shared a little
patch one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I guess he he had gotten some
seeds from you and we grew the root beer
[SPEAKER_00]: and we grew the the PK and some of your
cherry limes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like Urkel lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget some other and they were just
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the Urkel lime was insane,
especially in light of what you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about with the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like they were just these bulbous
buds that just just looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably probably the cherry lime out
of everything was was the favorite at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just getting to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the root beers were a
little later, but they just when they when
[SPEAKER_00]: they filled in, they were like just so
terpy and enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, your Humboldt Dream was my
buddy's biggest plants in the garden last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a picture of him just in the
Anderson Valley with this plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just like gigantic, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, oh, I'm doing this one every
year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys kudos to you guys for,
you know, putting out the quality work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, yeah, this year I'm going to
I'm going to probably pull out some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other Malawi hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've seen a lot of a lot of buzz
around the chocolate Malawi, which is one
[SPEAKER_00]: that I haven't been working with as much
in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe pull that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably one at the top of
the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the chocolate hash berry to the
heirloom Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the glue line is one
I've been working for a little while is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to find a reliable glue back cross
and find a male out of that that I can hit
[SPEAKER_00]: to things and get that, you know,
chocolatey, gassy aroma and taste out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hybrids that come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe we're gonna pull out
some some crazy land races and try to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with some, you know, some wild some wild
stuff and, you know, try to try to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what, you know, what else we could put out
there that is going to be unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about setting yourself apart in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like, you're saying maybe you
find a cut that you don't want to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to hear that somebody
found something out of my work that really
[SPEAKER_00]: worked well for them and they wanted to
keep around for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and maybe it helped keep them afloat
in tough times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so certainly we're going to keep
working for mold resistance, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even more of an issue nowadays
with the testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, some of the other projects,
you know, might might include,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe maybe some of the other
Malawis or, you know, I've kind of got a
[SPEAKER_00]: rough sketch, but but we haven't we
haven't nailed anything down yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think get back with the team
and see what everybody else wants to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe go back and look at
because I try to I try to catalog
[SPEAKER_00]: everything all the all the seeds,
you know, everybody that gave me seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go and try to catalog and
keep keep a list of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you do that long enough and
you're going to have a nice, nice
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hope I hope everybody starts
getting into more of their own like phenol
[SPEAKER_00]: hunts and finding things that do well in
your local situation, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever property that you might have
might be even totally different from your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor's parcel because they're on the
other side of the ridge, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or or maybe maybe the people down the road
or, you know, a little closer to a valley
[SPEAKER_00]: and they get more wind or, you know,
so so it's it's great to be here and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the different success
stories from different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that definitely has a big effect
on my personal, you know, decisions of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm going to go and breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is when I go and talk to the community or
I go to, you know, the Emerald Cup or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, see somebody out,
you know, you know, in town or something
[SPEAKER_00]: and they say, oh, well, you know,
you're you're, you know, sour orange or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your granddaddy orange or,
you know, maybe one of these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: dream queen glue or this or that like did
really well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I love I love hearing
everybody's stories of what they've done
[SPEAKER_00]: with my genetics and what they really
liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, you know, I've got folks that
rave about these two guys genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've tried in previous years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just keep the stories
coming.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what I like is that it's rare
that most most people nowadays what I
[SPEAKER_03]: learned, the Internet is where you talk
shit so you can get recognition,
[SPEAKER_03]: because otherwise you don't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unless you're flapping your mouth,
throwing rocks at someone else,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not even a real person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're sitting there hanging out and
you're talking about your experiences with
[SPEAKER_03]: jeans work back in the day and that's work
with your boy stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's just it's just cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
