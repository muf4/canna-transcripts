[SPEAKER_01]: And we see the same thing with hashes too,
like Nepalese ball hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a nice Nepalese hash,
a temple ball, you know that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get different cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Frenchy cannoli is talking about
you're seeing, you're seeing terpenoids
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of Nepalese hash balls that
you're not going to see in fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get a, you know,
a little bit of CBN degradation in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do a nice long slow cure,
you know, it's just, you get that much
[SPEAKER_01]: rounder whole plant feel, you know,
I used to live in the Caribbean for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time and we'd noticed that almost all the
bud that would come out of the Virgin
[SPEAKER_01]: Islands, it would be a golden brown color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that's because they don't
have indoor spaces to cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're curing in the sun because if
you're curing in the shade or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: jungle or the bush where you're growing
it, you're going to get a lot of rotten
[SPEAKER_01]: mold and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole cure concept is amazing in the
way the degradation and the color changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this in dispensaries all the
time now that the stuff that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: golden or a little amber is just sitting
on the shelf while all this bright green
[SPEAKER_00]: neon stuff is flying out the door and
people aren't realizing think about
[SPEAKER_00]: cigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the high end whiskies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how you're developing phenols
in curing and in transferring tannins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the crux of the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start changing these chlorophylls all
over to tannins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all this weed coming out of South
Florida that was cured in the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco ways with the Spanish cedar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the phenols completely change
the terpene profile when it goes in after
[SPEAKER_00]: curing in 28 to 30 days in the Spanish
cedar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just completely changes everything,
especially all the hazes and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: rootsy, spicy strains really just develop
in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the tobacco model, there's a cigar
now that I think is like $10,000 for the
[SPEAKER_01]: box of these cigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's 15-year-old tobacco that they've
been aging in these special humidors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with tobacco, it requires a much
higher humidity content.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be in a room with like a 70%
relative humidity to keep it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cannabis, especially in curing,
we want to keep it down around in the 50
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to have too much moisture
in there because you can get pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the curing process, you have to
worry about aspergillus and other things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really need to keep your room
stable and keep the humidity just perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: and the temperature in a certain range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to keep lots of airflow going
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just take your time with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are just in such a rush to get
things out the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you find that some of our favorite
things we have, I'm trying to remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A tange kush or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the tanger?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one that we've been curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the tange kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've cured it for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has drastically changed in nose,
in flavor, in every single way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just such a happy flower to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like velvet going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny to me how many of the same
concepts that we all have been focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: and developing for 20 or 30 years for
cannabis are so the same processes and
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts executed in different ways for
soil building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about these temperature ranges
and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think about those same exact
things for composting and for aging our
[SPEAKER_00]: forest products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use redwood in our soil because we're
up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a byproduct of existing industry that
was being wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use it in a very specific way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We compost it in a way to build all of the
microbiology correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires intense temperature monitoring
where we have to let it hit a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and roll it and then let it
build back up to those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to be meticulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to look at the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not paying attention,
it's going to get away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the experience comes in
for curing is so many people who are new
[SPEAKER_00]: to the industry don't even see the concept
as existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they can't execute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and there's the depth of each of
those things with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have all the different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the turpinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have every little bit of it that you
need all those parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is THC is THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a single note.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to affect your CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to trigger that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you can get the most refined
oil that is 90 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that flower, you're going to bring
into maturation all of the other parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the oils and the aromatics and and
really bringing it the same thing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to micro rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the you need every single bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dirt is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is alive.
