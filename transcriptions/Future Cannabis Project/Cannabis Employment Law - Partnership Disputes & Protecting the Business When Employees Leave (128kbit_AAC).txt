[SPEAKER_01]: Three is a lot of handshake agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks that sort of put companies together
on the ground level and sort of trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: each other that they would do the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had a lot more partnership
disputes where somebody would show up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary or a manufacturing plant and
literally the locks are changed and people
[SPEAKER_01]: pretend not to know each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get into these disputes about
who owns what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's revenue of the company,
intellectual property, that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that going on at an increasing
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think another thing that the
industry is starting to figure out as it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes away from licensing and a focus on
compliance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to look at branding and
the importance of branding really I think
[SPEAKER_01]: in the context of I want to get investment
in my company or I want to build this and
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it so I have to have brand
recognition and brand protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And IP protection, but there's not really
an understanding or a focus on the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that that has to start with your employees
because we've seen cases where individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: have worked for a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That company has been building client
base.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been building a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got intellectual property and how it
does things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see employees slipping out
under the cover of darkness and either
[SPEAKER_01]: going to work for a competitor or setting
up their business on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And companies are sort of left flat-footed
saying, what do we do now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not realizing what the landscape is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, not realizing that there are
some things you can do on the front end to
[SPEAKER_01]: put yourself in a position where
notwithstanding California's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: employee favoring laws, you can still get
some recourse from the courts in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: injunctive relief or damages when
employees do that and try to compete
[SPEAKER_01]: against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to sort of give best practices
around the upfront things one could do to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect yourself legally from somebody
jumping ship with all your trade secrets,
[SPEAKER_00]: your customer Rolodex, your know-how,
your idea and basically setting up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's almost like you go to
China, you set up a factory and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: head of the factory goes across the street
and creates the exact same product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beauty of doing business in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which for a cannabis company, you don't
have any choice but to do all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: business here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really runs the same sort of themes
as we've discussed with the industry as it
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to discrimination or harassment
prevention and sort of setting up some
[SPEAKER_01]: things there so that if there is a dispute
as to why somebody's let go, you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: some documentation around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are trying to protect your
brand, trying to protect your trade
[SPEAKER_01]: secrets in your intellectual property,
do those same things on the front end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify what you treat as trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify what you think is intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put agreements between yourself and the
employees that say, look, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gainfully employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you leave, you can't take all these
things with you so that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: expectation that these are sort of out and
open to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beyond sort of setting some of those
parameters with employees with written
[SPEAKER_01]: policies or agreements, treating that
intellectual property like it is
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's client or customer data or
formulas or products, put them under lock
[SPEAKER_01]: and key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treat them like the Colonel Special Spices
mix and KFC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Coca-Cola mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it under lock and key and let people
know that that's something that you hold
[SPEAKER_01]: as intellectual property that you feel is
special to the company and shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: used outside the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond the employee theft, which really
relates to having agreements and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding with the employee about
what's protected and what's not,
[SPEAKER_01]: and treating those things as protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that this business needs to
get away from the handshake agreements as
[SPEAKER_01]: between partners and business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that complicated to get
businesses into the correct form,
[SPEAKER_01]: have operating agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have partnership agreements or joint
venture agreements so that it lays out
[SPEAKER_01]: who's a party to what, who has equity,
who owns what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something that every one of
these businesses should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite frankly, if they're getting a
license, that stuff should formalize in
[SPEAKER_01]: that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned operating agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the concrete blocking and tackling
steps one can do around that topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting your business when people leave
or when they're disputes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're thinking about your
partners and the people that have an
[SPEAKER_01]: equity stake in the business, you want to
have written agreements in place that
[SPEAKER_01]: outline sort of what their rights are.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that context, probably the biggest one
to talk about is non-competes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, typically speaking,
you can't prevent someone from leaving you
[SPEAKER_01]: or leaving your company and competing
against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a restraint on trade and California
doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody has a ownership in the
business, I won't go too deep into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a material ownership in the business
and there's some sort of an event where
[SPEAKER_01]: they are liquidated, they sell that back
to you or you all sell to a third party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have that ownership,
there's an exception to the non-compete
[SPEAKER_01]: law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those sort of non-competes should exist
in those sort of agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving away from sort of the partners and
more talking about the employees,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, on the front end, when you're
giving somebody all those forms that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about, the application,
maybe an offer letter with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terms and conditions of their employment,
the state mandated notices, copy of your
[SPEAKER_01]: handbook with an acknowledgement,
whether it's in the handbook or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: there should be some sort of a standalone
document that says, maybe it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: offer letter or somewhere in that process,
documentation that this is what our
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property procedure is,
this is what we consider to be our trade
[SPEAKER_01]: secrets and you can't go outside of this
company with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work on a formula for an extraction
method and we come up with something
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing, you don't take that invention
with you down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those would be the big ones on the front
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the back end, just be smart
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do see that there's an issue,
you find out that someone has done
[SPEAKER_01]: something unsavory, we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Act quickly, jump out, do a cease and
desist letter, engage counsel if you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to, and if there's an appropriate avenue
to do it, file for a temporary restraining
[SPEAKER_01]: order and try to get them to stop from
using your trade secrets.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
