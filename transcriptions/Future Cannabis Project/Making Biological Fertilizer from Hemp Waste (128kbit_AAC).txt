[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on guys, Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you guys how I am making
biological fertilizer out of green waste
[SPEAKER_00]: from hemp or canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do is I mulch up the
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought this off of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 175 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come over here, you come check out the
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's mulched up pretty fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do is I'm going to
fill up this five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll fit about 12 pounds of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already done the measurements prior
to the video when I've made this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just fill that all the way up like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to pack it in pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to fill it all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you have all of your bucket filled
up with your material, you go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: fill it all the way up with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approximately two and a half gallons
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will actually make all of the
minerals and nutrients bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will also create lots of different
amino acids and enzymes that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the microbiology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a two for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the biology, plus you get the
minerals and nutrients, you get amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids, you get enzymes, you get plant
hormones, you get different types of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, oxen, cytokinin, gibberellic
acid, all that stuff is all contained
[SPEAKER_00]: within this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next step is you're going to
use a thousand milliliters of molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go ahead and dump that
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, a liter,
a thousand milliliters of microbe plus
[SPEAKER_00]: from my company, Vokashi Earthworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the microbes, the consortium
that will ferment this and break this down
[SPEAKER_00]: into its basic components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend doing this outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the things that you want
to make sure that you do is you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you have one of these screw
on lids and you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: your seal is intact because you want to
make sure that there's no oxygen in this,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this mix because these are FocuLube
anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need low or no oxygen conditions to
break this material down and ferment it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to go ahead and screw
this lid on right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to screw it on really,
really tight, make sure that you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: firm seal and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some spills over, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to expand as it ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to, you're going
to want to crack open the seal maybe once
[SPEAKER_00]: a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just leave this for 20 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be completely broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can extract the liquid out of
here and use it at a rate of 1000 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is how you make biological
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of cannabis or hemp green waste.
