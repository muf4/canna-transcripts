[SPEAKER_03]: It's an honor to be in the position I am
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'll tell you a little bit about
what we've been doing the last year and
[SPEAKER_03]: what's been happening over the last couple
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: As all of you know, last year I was
appointed, but my responsibility was to
[SPEAKER_03]: put together the first state regulatory
system for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then something happened in November,
and it changed just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our role was expanded to adult use
also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Bureau serves as the lead agency on
this effort, but we're not doing it alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also work together with the Department
of Food and Agriculture and Department of
[SPEAKER_03]: Public Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Food and Ag is, they're the ones who are
licensing our cultivators, public health,
[SPEAKER_03]: the manufacturers, and then the Bureau is
handling the rest with the testing
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratories, the distributors,
transporters, dispensaries, and micro
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been working pretty hard,
doing a lot of public outreach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to be in Orange County again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of us, all of us from the
three agencies, one, we all started with
[SPEAKER_03]: practically no staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we got them on board, we need to
learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to learn about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, I came from alcohol,
and I thought, oh, okay, I'll come do
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always say alcohol is easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is more complicated, a lot more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of learning, a lot of
talking to the public and the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeing what you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think our job, we've tried to take
an approach that we want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the first things out the gate
that really surprised me, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: was how open everybody was to telling us
about cannabis, about their business,
[SPEAKER_03]: about their struggles over the last couple
decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has been a tremendous asset to
the three licensing authorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because unless we know what you're doing,
it's really hard to regulate and regulate
[SPEAKER_03]: in a thoughtful manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we've been working on,
our medical regulations, and along with
[SPEAKER_03]: other things, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all three standing up an IT system,
and we have, Food and Ag has to do an
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental study, the Bureau is also
doing an environmental initial study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of things going on
simultaneously, and do I have to ask,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is our aggressive timeline?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna be issuing licenses when?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys are supposed to be more
excited about that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it sounds really aggressive,
and what do I keep saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the law, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a big part of this lift was getting
our medical regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as most of you, how many have already
taken a look at our regulations so far?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for all three of us, we came out with
our regulations last Friday, and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: had one straggler, that was the testing
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_03]: That came out today, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is out on our website right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we separated the packages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, having testing labs,
that was the biggest probably challenge,
[SPEAKER_03]: is putting together those regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what now we're looking at is one thing
we need from you, and I don't take this
[SPEAKER_03]: lightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: California has a very robust rule-making
process, and I know we talk about,
[SPEAKER_03]: we always say regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what are regulations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're basically the requirements
that we're putting into place for
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody that's gonna get a license with
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the statutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Medical Canvas and Regulation
and Safety Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's further defining those
requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the things that you're gonna
see in our regulations, first of all,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna define a whole bunch of things
that you see in the statutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We define them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have detailed what the application
requirements are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So exactly what you're gonna see on day
one when you fill out an application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we go into further things like
who's an owner?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is a spouse an owner?
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of those things, what's priority
licensing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the things, then when we went
into specific license types and we laid
[SPEAKER_03]: out things, for example, the dispensaries,
their requirements for storage and
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging, and hours of operation,
delivery requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those things are in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the California rule-making process,
I have this question all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask, what's taking so long?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: And why don't you just take Colorado or
Washington regulations and just copy them?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say, well, we probably don't wanna
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that they're not good regulations,
but those statutes weren't for California.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was for Colorado and they're very
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is when we do the
California rule-making process,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, for the regulator it's
probably difficult, but for the public,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a great thing because of all the
feedback, all the commenting that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: have on our regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you basically can shape those
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you see right now are proposed
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I may say that a couple times tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're draft, they're proposed,
they're by no means final.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is our first step of saying,
okay, we've gone about, we've talked to
[SPEAKER_03]: other states, we've talked to the
industry, we've talked to the local
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdiction, we've talked to the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we came up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that text, we also have to
put together what's called an initial
[SPEAKER_03]: statement of reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: For every regulation that we have text
for, we have to justify why we put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see that a lot across the other
states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for California, if you wanna say,
well, why the heck did the Bureau say
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go back to that initial statement
of reason and say, oh, that's why they
[SPEAKER_03]: said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that doesn't mean you're gonna agree
with us, and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're okay with you not agreeing with us,
but what we would like to hear is,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, did we get some stuff right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, we got a few things right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we get some stuff, we're not quite
there yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we wanna hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us, what did we get wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then tell us how we can make it
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what this is all about,
this whole public process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we're in the 45-day period
for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from last Friday, from all of the regs,
there's a 45-day comment period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the testing labs straggled.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came out today, so it started out a
45-day comment period.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a chance for you to weigh in and
help develop these regs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens next?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we look at those comments,
and we have to respond to those comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, so we will have to respond to your
comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's important to note that these are
for medical regulations, but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: work and what we put into them,
a lot of it's going to apply on the adult
[SPEAKER_03]: use side also.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of things are not going to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what are we gonna do?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we doing right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, while we wait for comments,
we're already developing the adult use
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations, because we have to,
because our regulations have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: finalized by the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, we can't issue licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be issuing our adult
regulations probably in the early fall,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we are gonna do that through what we
have in the statute, which is an emergency
[SPEAKER_03]: rule-making authority.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning, when we notice them, they pretty
much go into effect immediately,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then all the public comment is on the
backend, and we have a certain time
[SPEAKER_03]: period.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to get that done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of why we wanted to release the
medical right now is because we wanna hear
[SPEAKER_03]: from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanna take, you know, you can give us
comments that I think will help us with
[SPEAKER_03]: the adult use also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another reason we'll probably wait till
the fall is why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he said harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't looking at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's brilliant, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna start using that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have two statutes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you wanna be, if you wanna have
a medical dispensary, or you wanna be a
[SPEAKER_03]: retailer of adult use, you have,
so far now we have two statutes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the governor's budget has said they
want to try to align the two statutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why do you think we'd wanna do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But probably also, but it's a lot more
efficient and productive and cheaper for
[SPEAKER_03]: all of us if we align them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: How confusing would it be for you guys if
I said, well, if you get a medical
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary, you're under this set of
rules, but if you get an adult use,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna be under this rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be confusing for the state,
it would be confusing for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're seeing right now is what's
called the governor's budget trailer bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many have looked at that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's caught a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, with the governor's trailer
bill, they're trying to align the two
[SPEAKER_03]: models.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so likely, that is currently a bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be passed by two thirds of the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we likely won't know what the results
are of that until late June.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will know what it will look
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we're preparing,
we're always preparing for whatever we
[SPEAKER_03]: think might come down the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have some legislative
bills out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many do we have out there right now
for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a moving target around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes my job pretty interesting and
exciting because every day something
[SPEAKER_03]: changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're waiting to see what happens on
some of those 60, I didn't think it was
[SPEAKER_03]: that many, but anyway, those 60 bills to
see how it may further change what our
[SPEAKER_03]: roles and responsibilities are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we're trying to do with these
regulations and I think it's important for
[SPEAKER_03]: you to know, we do as California,
we want the best model.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want people to look at our model and
say, gosh, California got it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's important to me and I think
it's important to all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we also wanna make sure we're
protecting the patients and the consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: and the public and the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, we don't want our
regulations that are so onerous on a
[SPEAKER_03]: business that it's very difficult to
comply.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's trying to strike that balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you, it's not easy to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're gonna hear me saying this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We truly want you to read these and
comment on them because I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to weigh in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's where we get to,
I don't think the Bureau, Food and Ag and
[SPEAKER_03]: Public Health can alone come up with the
best model for California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it takes everybody in this room to
help us with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now is everybody gonna go home and
download the text of our regs,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So to help you with that, we have a new
portal.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many know we have now a portal that's
cannabis.ca.gov.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought about making sure we held onto
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grabbed that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it is a portal that you can go to
and you can get to all three licensing
[SPEAKER_03]: authorities, Public Health, Food and Ag
and the Bureau.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get all of our regulations,
all of the initial statement of reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, we all, because these are
considered major regulations, we all had
[SPEAKER_03]: to do an economic impact report.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that is out there and it's gonna
show you what our economists came up with
[SPEAKER_03]: on the impact the cannabis industry is
going to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all out there for you and it's one
portal and I really hope you go out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also, all three departments have a
listserv.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not on our listserv,
we blast this all out on email.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many have been to just the Bureau's
website?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna come back and everybody raises
their hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've gotten pretty, we have some
social media out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank goodness I have a communications guy
that does that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have Facebook and Twitter and we're
pretty good about putting where we're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be at and what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what will be coming up in the month
of June are four regulation, actually five
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations hearings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to go out and to different
locations across the state and have our
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation hearings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many came to our pre-regulation
hearings here?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were like, for those of you who
went to that, there was a lot of small
[SPEAKER_03]: group discussions, a lot of back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: On regulation hearings, they're a
different format.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually will just do an introduction
and it's just a chance for you to go up to
[SPEAKER_03]: the mic and give us your comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a court reporter there and they're
gonna take that all down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll be sort of, it'll be different
for you guys because we're not supposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: say anything back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to listen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure for some of us who like to
talk, that's gonna be very difficult not
[SPEAKER_03]: to say anything back, but it's just the
format of how we do regulations hearing
[SPEAKER_03]: for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be in LA, we're gonna be
in San Jose, Sacramento, and Eureka.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Public Health and Department of
Food and Ag are gonna be in different
[SPEAKER_03]: places also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've covered the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all on that portal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really welcome you to go there and see
that and if you can attend.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is not the only way you can give
comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can provide us written comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can email us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all on our website, how you can
participate in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been a tremendous challenge and I
know folks have said, I just was at a
[SPEAKER_03]: budget hearing and I know people worry,
how are you gonna make this deadline?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you gonna do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we've, from day one that was
my task.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said this is our deadline.
[SPEAKER_03]: January 1st of 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that Proposition 64 did was
it just made it even more clear that we
[SPEAKER_03]: had to issue licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have learned to adapt and
respond when things change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really believe more time isn't gonna
make that much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to start regulating this process,
this product at the state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so is there gonna be some bumps along
the road?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you turn on a switch on January 1st and
license everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you're gonna see in our
regulations, and I would really like to
[SPEAKER_03]: hear what people think of these,
especially those of you who are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and you have your local permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've looked at having temporary permits
for folks that are in compliance to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also looked to continue operations
and giving you some grace period to get
[SPEAKER_03]: your application in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not gonna say everybody has to be
in day one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gave like a six month period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also looked at testing,
because all cannabis is gonna have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we knew if we start licensing people
in the first couple months, likely the
[SPEAKER_03]: product that you have in your dispensaries
or distributors or wherever is not gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put some grace period to be able to
test and also get your packaging up and
[SPEAKER_03]: running.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think those are things you need to
look at and really respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think what I've envisioned
January 1 is we're gonna try to have these
[SPEAKER_03]: transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna try to transition as best
we can to bring folks into the regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think it's one of those things
that we need to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's not gonna be perfect at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things I say is maybe
something doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Us as the state have to be ready to
respond when things don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to respond quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is an industry that evolves.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has evolved very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my commitment is is when we do get
you up and running, we have those
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: If things aren't working, then we have to
be able to respond and change those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's an absolute pleasure to be
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't take any more time anxious to
listen to your questions and answer them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: What areas of the regulations are you
struggling with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you, I think I said
earlier, the lab regulations were,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was a big heavy lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that as you see in both
AUMA and Medical Cannabis Regulation and
[SPEAKER_03]: Safety Act, that is a, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big thing about the cannabis
testing and making sure we're testing for
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides and having those levels of
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was probably the biggest challenge
for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one was just, I think some of
these things, for me, some of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was used to doing regulations at my
previous agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually coming up with what we are
gonna require on an application sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we are gonna require,
who's gonna be in ownership?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who qualifies as owners?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at, that was a big question at
our pre-regulation, is who's gonna have to
[SPEAKER_03]: be background and fingerprint?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you see our regulations,
you'll see we have really taken the
[SPEAKER_03]: approach of going, aligning it with
Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at a 20% aggregate
ownership and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not having spouses having to be
background, but having to be disclosed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a lot of back and forth
because we had different sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: More people wanted more background checks,
employee background checks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we looked at, there was two
different sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no employee background checks
either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really tried to strike that balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Laurie, last question before I introduce
the next speaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: People in the business, I hear a lot of
questions about banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we bank?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we use credit cards?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there, it's probably a tad out of your
purview, but I'm curious because
[SPEAKER_04]: everything marijuana right now is sort of
under your purview.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comments on banking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, banking, that's a really tough
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of you watched our budget hearing
yesterday, that was a big question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are all these state agencies going to
accept cash, especially if we can't bank
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of time was spent on talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Board of Equalization, the Bureau,
everybody that you're going to have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, we're preparing for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our facilities are preparing that to make
sure we have a facility that can take
[SPEAKER_03]: cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that really the answer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not the best answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now we're working with John Chung,
our state treasurer, has a banking
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis working group that I serve as a
member on that committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are trying to look for solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a solution for California?
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking to having a coordinated
approach with all the different agencies
[SPEAKER_03]: and the local agencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have the cannabis associations
on this board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Likely we are not going to find a solution
by January 1st of 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there still needs to be some
federal, there has to be something
[SPEAKER_03]: happening at the federal level,
I think, to make it easier for people to
[SPEAKER_03]: bank cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, we are going to all of us
are going to have an online system that
[SPEAKER_03]: can take credit cards, that can take debit
cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to just take all forms of
whatever you're going to come to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't figured out Bitcoin yet,
but everything else we'll take,
[SPEAKER_03]: basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody asked me to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not the Bureau, that's
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the industry, that's the state
agency, the federal government.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, at some point, we all need to
find this solution together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think California coming on board
with the legalized market, I'm hoping
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be some movement on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll tell you, from my point of
view, I know you guys, dealing with cash
[SPEAKER_03]: is the safety issues, the public safety
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even just when you look at it,
here we're going to regulate this highly
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated product that we're going to
regulate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, a lot of regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to still be using
cash as a regulator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Following the cash and figuring out that,
it's very difficult as a regulator to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think for all of us, we all want
to find a solution to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will tell you, there's some people in
this room from a growth facility to invest
[SPEAKER_04]: in, supposed to gross when it's all really
going 30 million a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if state tax are 13%, you can imagine
it's like Scarface or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: With big barrels of cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a pretty scary proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Jackie McGowan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a question for Lori Ajax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to say thank you all for
all the hard work that you're doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: many different aspects of this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I track local regulations, specifically
the medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my question is regarding the
recreational adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only seen two cities talk about
allowing adult use dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they were to open their doors on
January 1st of 2018, nobody's talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the fact that there is not one
single municipality in the entire state
[SPEAKER_01]: that is even thinking about allowing adult
use cultivation, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on January 1st, if you're ready to
accept applications for adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, like the voters have voted
for, where's the supply chain going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of these jurisdictions,
I think what was said earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they are waiting to see what the
state is doing with their regulations on
[SPEAKER_03]: both medical and adult use.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them just don't have the
resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's usually the state rolling out
the regulations and the city and counties
[SPEAKER_03]: following.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, they've been doing it a lot
longer than the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do a lot of outreach with the local
municipalities.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not our job to convince them one way
or the other, but it's important to
[SPEAKER_03]: explain to them where we're at on our
regulation process, when they're coming
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're thinking there'll be a lot more
movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in adult use, we can't issue a
license if it violates local ordinance or
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is local control, which is
challenging for us at the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we do have to make sure that we're
not violating anything by issuing that
[SPEAKER_03]: license.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things we're looking at,
too, and just to give you an idea,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not just the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the supply chain across the whole
state we worry about, whether there's
[SPEAKER_03]: enough testing labs to test the product,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are trying to get to a point
where our IT system would be able to start
[SPEAKER_03]: taking applications sooner than January
1st, 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are trying to fast track that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not gonna sit here and say it's
going to be ready, because a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: determines with our IT right now what
we're working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have staff, that's what they spend all
day long is configuring our system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we could take applications ahead of
time, it gives us an idea of where people
[SPEAKER_03]: are applying, how many license types are
out there, and would really give us a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of runway for January 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would give everybody a lot more
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Tomer Graciani and I'm a small
edible manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question is to Lori Ajax.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first I'd like to thank everyone in
the panel for coming tonight and for Susan
[SPEAKER_00]: for helping put this event together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As someone that was in the pre-regulatory
meetings that the Bureau held,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very optimistic about the Bureau
being open to feedback from the public to
[SPEAKER_00]: these regulations because most of the
comments that were brought up in our
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-regulatory discussions were,
I think the exact opposite of it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: this draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take for one example the milligram
limit, 100 milligram limit per package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are a lot of patients
that, some of them are vets that have PTSD
[SPEAKER_00]: and require higher dosages, for example,
two or 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you break it down and you think
that a 10 milligram dose is maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent of 75 calories, that means that
in 100 milligram pack there's 750 calories
[SPEAKER_00]: and in their dose there would be 2250
calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the allocated calorie
consumption per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they supposed to take their
medicine if they're forced to eat so much
[SPEAKER_00]: calories?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bureau didn't develop the
manufacturing regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from the Department of Public
Health, but they were with us at our
[SPEAKER_03]: pre-regulation hearings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't comment on how they, because they
have a lot of folks, they're research
[SPEAKER_03]: scientists that came up with those
regulations, but I will tell you for all
[SPEAKER_03]: three of us, we have continued to say
these are proposed regulations,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're draft regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly what you're saying right now is
what I would hope that you would
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate that to my colleagues at the
Department of Public Health because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to tell you they are very open to
comment, but you have to also understand
[SPEAKER_03]: they're also, when we look at lessons
learned from other states, they're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at some of what had happened with the
edibles in Colorado and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I think maybe in the beginning they
came out a little conservative,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think they're open to other things,
especially if you can justify the reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why it should be higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Pamela Epstein and I am an
attorney and a consultant in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the pleasure of working with
operators and both with cities drafting
[SPEAKER_02]: MCRSA compliant ordinances and
regulations, and so as I'm reading through
[SPEAKER_02]: the regulations, I have operators who are
delivery service providers who are able to
[SPEAKER_02]: go and get medication to the patients that
need it that can't come into a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have cities that look at dispensary or
delivery as an option that's easier for
[SPEAKER_02]: them, more palatable than a storefront.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, in the trailer bill,
and in the regs, there is no outlet for
[SPEAKER_02]: them, so they need to comment,
and whereas I appreciate the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Public Health giving an NNAP license so
that we can have a more robust situation
[SPEAKER_02]: in that realm, we don't have that same
thing for the delivery, so Lori,
[SPEAKER_02]: my question is for you, but thank you
everybody for the work you do in this
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some bills that are
addressing the non-front dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: but even so, even in AUMA, there's nothing
in there that says you have to advertise
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're a storefront dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when you look at our regs as we go
forward with adult use, for delivery,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has to be dispensary employees,
so it can't be a third-party delivery,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you just need to have a location and
comply with our definition of premises,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is separate and distinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether or not you advertise, I think
there's gonna be different cities and
[SPEAKER_03]: counties that may not want you to
advertise, so I think when we go forward
[SPEAKER_03]: with our adult use regulations,
I think some of that may be resolved.
Thank you.
