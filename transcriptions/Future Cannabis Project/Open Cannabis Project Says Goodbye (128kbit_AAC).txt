[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Beth Schechter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the executive director of the Open
Cannabis Project, which, as many people
[SPEAKER_01]: know, is closing on May 31st, 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joined today by Dale Hunt,
who is on my board and also who is a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent lawyer and botanist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Dale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the Cultivation Classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had our first and last legal
advocacy, legal and advocacy clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, part of the reason we decided
that we wanted to do this clinic is
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, as Open Cannabis
Project has been happening for the past
[SPEAKER_01]: year and a half, one of the things that
we've identified as a real need is a need
[SPEAKER_01]: for connecting growers and breeders with
lawyers and legal resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawyer fees are expensive, and so part of
what we wanted to do with this legal
[SPEAKER_01]: clinic is to really create a resource that
made legal content, legal educational
[SPEAKER_01]: content available to breeders and growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it available, make it really
affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, you know, $12 to $24 sliding
scale donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those proceeds are going to the
Kraft Cannabis Alliance and to Vote Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: OCP is not taking any of those donations
at this time, or ever, because we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like it was a success, and for
people who weren't there, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we covered licenses and patents for
strains, including some open source
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered interstate commerce,
and we really talked about hemp and FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these matters, all of these laws
are really complicated, and they surround
[SPEAKER_01]: us every day, and they impact us every
single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, part of the, you know,
and I'll talk about Open Cannabis Project
[SPEAKER_01]: closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as people know, there has been a
big controversy that has been involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: Filos, and that absolutely, and,
you know, coming to light with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: information that came through on that was
a big reason why we closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the only reason, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason just had to do with,
like, ongoing financial difficulty,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think had to do with people not
trusting us, which then had to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: this controversy, which was all the more
reason to just be like, well, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: seem like a battle that's worth fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, also, on top of that,
part of the reason why we decided to close
[SPEAKER_01]: is because the conversation is shifting,
and what we are realizing is our reality
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis is shifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of what's happening right now is that
we are grieving the death of an ideal,
[SPEAKER_01]: an ideal that mainstream cannabis would be
a reflection of the people who brought it
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because that's not what's happening,
we have to take off our rose-colored
[SPEAKER_01]: glasses and do a better job of working
together and organizing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that involves not only, one,
looking at the landscape very
[SPEAKER_01]: realistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also involves understanding what the
law is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And understanding what the law is is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding how technology works is
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding genetics and genetic data is
very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is, you know, it's
understandable why people don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, if we are going to
organize from the ground up and if we are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to really try to succeed right now,
then part of what we need to do right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is we do have to have educated
conversations, and we do have to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, in order to have these
educated conversations, we need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyers help us to understand,
like, what the F is actually going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: this country, in this state, in this
jurisdiction, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that things are different by
state by state and jurisdiction by
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdiction just doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, our hope had been prior to
this legal clinic that this would be a key
[SPEAKER_01]: part of our programming going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though we're going away,
there's definitely still demand for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are talking to lawyers who are
interested in helping with legal clinics
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had also begun a project where we were
putting together standard open source and
[SPEAKER_01]: also commercial licenses for breeders and
growers who wanted to license their
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That work is also going to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will likely continue with new
partners, new directions, and certainly be
[SPEAKER_01]: as, you know, democratic from the ground
up as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, you know, that's a very,
but, you know, talking about legal
[SPEAKER_01]: resources for breeders and growers is a
different conversation than open source
[SPEAKER_01]: your information, open source your
strains, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that open source is really
giving away your stuff for free,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of people see it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd like to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an idea just at lunch, and I
thought, hey, let's put this in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have said, in fact, I said this
at Emerald Cup on the panel that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: on, that there's a fundamental difference
between open source copyright,
[SPEAKER_00]: open source software, and open source
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the problem with
everything people have promulgated so far
[SPEAKER_00]: with open source seed licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that people are doing that in
some way that's sort of like an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative to intellectual property
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: With open source software, that is,
that starts with a fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-existence of intellectual property
rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because software has copyright as soon as
you create it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copyright exists as soon as you create
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because there's an
international convention to that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, people don't have
intellectual property as soon as they
[SPEAKER_00]: create a plant variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not automatically assigned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow a plant, you have to have more of
a process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just optimistically or
altruistically put your seeds out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of an open source system,
it's an honor system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trust system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it requires some kind of community
cooperation that is only as strong as all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooperating in that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thought I had at lunch was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole copyright system didn't exist
until there was an international
[SPEAKER_00]: convention to that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only a generation old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit more than a generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in law school or just coming
out of law school, that was relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be that you had to register
your copyright before you had any
[SPEAKER_00]: copyrights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we agitate for some breeder's
rights that exist as soon as you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we could create some
massive system where there is this huge
[SPEAKER_00]: honor system among everybody who
participates in an open source breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only as good as the least
honorable member of that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gee, are there any dishonorable
members of the cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there might be a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, as long as we're lobbying
for change, why don't we lobby for some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an international convention for
rights, inherent rights of plant breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have a right to the ownership of
their cultivars as soon as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: created?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be crazy, but why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's worth considering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that is an amazing idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that would help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder, though, are there, I mean,
now I wondered like law student questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: not that I'm a law student, but it's like,
OK, are there existing, is there an
[SPEAKER_01]: existing reason in place why, you know,
inventorship is not automatically assigned
[SPEAKER_01]: to other things anyway, including plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is this something that has been
considered and rejected because of X or Y?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be hard to prove, but on the
other hand, I don't know, maybe nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: just ever asked the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give myself that much
credit for being original.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a good idea and it's
worth pursuing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth considering as an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, one of the differences between a
utility patent and a plant patent is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's quite a bit of debate with a
utility patent about whether what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you invented is actually new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the purpose of a patent
examiner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through this whole
elaborate examination process to prove
[SPEAKER_00]: that what you think you invented is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, they have to do this
examination.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at all the so-called prior art
and you establish whether it's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if you breed a plant,
pretty much by statistical definition,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you do in that breeding process
is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic act of doing a sexual cross
and creating a new cultivar, a new cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not necessarily a cultivar until it's
stable, but that new strain, that F1 is
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistically, it's impossible that it's
not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's original.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same theory of copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I create something, if I write
something new, as long as it's long enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to be new, it's original, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the originality is what constitutes
the, it's deserving of a, it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: deserving of a copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me at least, you know, in my post
lunch addled brain, it seems like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it seems, it seems like at least
theoretically you've, you've cleared the
[SPEAKER_00]: novelty hurdle, the originality hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no examination process needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you can establish ownership,
you should be entitled to your right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have the automatic existence of
some intellectual property, then you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to have an open source
system that would actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then, you know, I've been dubious
about open source systems for seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why I haven't really jumped into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not because I don't support it,
just because of its workability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm in, I'm in favor of it in
concept to just, I've been dubious about
[SPEAKER_00]: its workability because it's only as,
because it's only as workable as its least
[SPEAKER_00]: honorable member.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, this, this could work in
this, in a very similar way to open source
[SPEAKER_00]: software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that is one idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many ideas out there,
many ideas out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that people have, thoughts,
feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard from a ton of people who've
said that they are sad that open cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: project is closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sad too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're also ready to let go of
some baggage and move forward in some
[SPEAKER_01]: nimbler ways and to do so from the
community up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for people who are interested in
thinking about these ideas, being part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the next step, one, go to
opencannabisproject.org slash surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one very simple survey now that
we are going to be putting out some more
[SPEAKER_01]: going, going forward, but there's a simple
sort of sunset survey right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have thoughts about what we
should do when, after we close,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd love to hear them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if you have just general
thoughts, send us a note at info at
[SPEAKER_01]: opencannabisproject.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look forward to hearing from you and to
building something new together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already kind of the seeds are
planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are happening.
Thank you.
