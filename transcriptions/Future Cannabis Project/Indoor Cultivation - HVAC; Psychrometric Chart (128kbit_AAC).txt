[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about the psychology
chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spend a lot of time as engineers using
this tool, this device, which discusses
[SPEAKER_02]: the properties of air and the water in the
air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use it to figure out how to
condition that air, whether it's heating,
[SPEAKER_02]: cooling, humidifying, dehumidifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: This chart comes from many, many hundreds
of thousands of points of data that are
[SPEAKER_02]: collected in the field to generate this
chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all has to do with how much air is
in the water and how we go from one
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature of air or one humidification
point of air to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk about the chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should all have a handy-dandy,
Inspire psychometric chart in your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some of the different
axes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is our chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along the bottom, you're going to find the
dry bulb temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry bulb temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find the wet bulb
temperature in a diagonal from the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: right-hand corner of the chart to the top
left-hand corner of the chart in green
[SPEAKER_02]: lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find the dew point
temperature as an axis here along the
[SPEAKER_02]: y-axis of the chart on the right-hand
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find relative humidity as
swooping lines starting from 100,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the very top of this chart,
along this swooping line, to 0% relative
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity along this flat line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the swooping lines that are connected
in between are all the relative humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing you'll find is the
humidity ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the humidity ratio also runs along
this axis here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this axis right here is the humidity
ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It deals with the amount of water in air
per pound of air itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what all these different
terms mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dry bulb thermometer is the thermometer
you might be used to when someone took
[SPEAKER_02]: your temperature as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a thermometer that, when waved
around in the air, it is dry on the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bulb right here is dry, and it is
measuring what we call the sensible energy
[SPEAKER_02]: of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the dry bulb temperature of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you want to use this chart,
you can use one of these thermometers to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure the air you're trying to put on
the chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wave it around in that air, and it will
tell you where you should be along this
[SPEAKER_02]: axis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next couple of tools will help us
figure out how far up we go on this axis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To find our place on the chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have a dry bulb, now we have a wet
bulb thermometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar device.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's the exact same device,
except there is a sock at the end of it
[SPEAKER_02]: that is soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the wet bulb thermometer is going to
find another point on this chart,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's going to tell us the rate at
which the water is evaporating off of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sock, and in doing so, bring down the
temperature of the bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is encased in that wet sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I want to find out the wet bulb
temperature of some air I need to measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take this wet sock,
sling it around inside my room that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to measure, and the temperature I
read on this chart will give us the second
[SPEAKER_02]: point along the wet bulb lines,
and between the two points, I now know
[SPEAKER_02]: where we are on the chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that because of the evaporative cooling
effect of water?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is because of the evaporative cooling
effect of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same reason that we sweat when we get
hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same reason that plants transpire when
they're exposed to radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk about why the dew point is
relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this dew point on the chart,
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something you'll see every day on
the nightly news.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll talk about the dew point
temperature as we go into our overnight
[SPEAKER_02]: condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're really concerned about is if
the temperature of the air gets below this
[SPEAKER_02]: number that we call the dew point,
we are going to have condensation come out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the air and onto the surface that is at
or below that dew point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm going to repeat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dew point is the temperature at which
condensation will occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if I take a can of Coke out of a
fridge, and it's below the dew point of
[SPEAKER_02]: the air that we've plotted using our dry
bulb and wet bulb thermometers,
[SPEAKER_02]: that can of Coke, being below the dew
point, will condense moisture on its
[SPEAKER_02]: surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the principle by which most
mechanical cooling is done and most
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical dehumidification is done as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference between dew point
and absolute humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dew point is a measure of absolute
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any line that goes directly up and down
here, any axis that is on the y-axis of
[SPEAKER_02]: this chart, is a measure or a reference
for absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, one of the things you should note is
that it is a useful tool rather than an
[SPEAKER_02]: absolute measure of a physical property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, and I probably didn't
word that right, but I'll get it right
[SPEAKER_02]: next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as an example, we're about to talk
about the humidity ratio, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: actual measurement of the amount of water
in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could collect it all inside of a
pound of air, which takes up about 13
[SPEAKER_02]: cubic square feet, if we could take all
the water in that and measure it out and
[SPEAKER_02]: plot whatever point we're at on that
humidity ratio, we'll find out exactly how
[SPEAKER_02]: many grains of water, of which there are
7,000 in a pound, we'll find out how many
[SPEAKER_02]: grains of water are inside that 13 cubic
feet of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an absolute measure of a physical
quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so dew occurs when surfaces reach
the dew point temperature outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fog occurs when the air is saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if we happen to hit that magical
condition in Santa Cruz all summer long
[SPEAKER_02]: when the temperature is 60 degrees
Fahrenheit and the air coming in off the
[SPEAKER_02]: ocean has been cooled down to 60 degrees,
the moisture being at 100% as it's picked
[SPEAKER_02]: up all that water off the ocean,
rolls in as fog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fog is air, which is saturated with
water and can no longer hold any more
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I tried to mist water into it,
that water would beat up, form raindrops
[SPEAKER_02]: and fall out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that one other measure we want to talk
about is the relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk about what relative
humidity is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see these swooping lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bottom one here is zero and then they
start swooping up from zero all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to note that the
relative humidity is the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture that's in a given amount of air
over the amount of moisture that the given
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of air can hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a measure of how much of the air
is water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a look at the humidity ratio,
which we'll describe shortly, you'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: out very quickly that at 100% relative
humidity, we're not talking more than a
[SPEAKER_02]: percent or two of actual water molecules
versus the rest of the air molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, 100% relative humidity is only one or
two percent of water in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everyone follow that?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% relative humidity is a measure of the
water carrying capacity of air,
[SPEAKER_02]: not of the amount of water that makes up
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if I have a given volume of air and I
put in 50%, of what it can hold,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 50% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have saturated air, if I go into a
cloud and take a measure of how much water
[SPEAKER_02]: is in that volume of air, I will find that
I could not put any more water into that
[SPEAKER_02]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what clouds are.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what fog is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what a misting system creates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates 100% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, now let's talk about the humidity
ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's say I was going to take that
volume of air, which was at 50 or 100%
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity, and squeeze out the
cloud, squeeze out all the water from that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular volume, and then weigh the
water versus the weight of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humidity ratio is a weight divided by
a weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humidity ratio is grains, which is a
unit of measure for weight, grains of
[SPEAKER_02]: water divided by pounds of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is grains per pound, grains of water
per pound of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everyone follow?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other numbers that exist for this
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time you see humidity ratio,
you can expect it to be a mass over a
[SPEAKER_02]: mass, or a weight over a weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you may have grams per kilogram,
you may have pounds per pound,
[SPEAKER_02]: and when you go pounds per pound,
well, you've got very, very small numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the humidity ratio that we work with,
which is grains divided by pounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: just happens to give us numbers that are
in our tangible reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not five, six decimal places.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in the hundreds or thousands
or millions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just exist in a very small number
that is useful for us to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we've talked about this entire
chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know everything there is to know about
finding your way around this chart,
[SPEAKER_02]: except to say that things change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air changes, temperature changes,
humidities change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk a little bit about what we
can do with this information to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're going to go and apply it in
our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start by finding our way onto a
specific point on the chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's say we've got our dry bulb
thermometer and we've got our wet bulb
[SPEAKER_02]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go outside on a hot, humid day in
Atlanta, because it's definitely not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measure 95 degrees Fahrenheit dry bulb,
and we measure 78 degrees Fahrenheit wet
[SPEAKER_02]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, take a moment to look at your
psychometric charts and let's play clock
[SPEAKER_02]: the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, on the x-axis down here, you're going
to find 95 degrees Fahrenheit between 90
[SPEAKER_02]: and 100, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're going to look at the wet bulb
lines and you're going to take the 95
[SPEAKER_02]: degree Fahrenheit line all the way up
until it crosses through the 78 degree
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit wet bulb line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should put with your pen a little
dot there, and that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what else do we know about this
point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Vatsal, tell me, what is the relative
humidity at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 48.
[SPEAKER_02]: 95 degrees Fahrenheit and 78 degrees wet
bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, along the x-axis on the bottom
of this chart, go to 95 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, look at the green lines, which are
the wet bulb temperature that run in this
[SPEAKER_02]: direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now find the one that's at 78,
so 75, 76, 77, 78.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now, draw it over until those two
points meet, 95 and 78.
[SPEAKER_02]: And put a circle there, put a dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, tell me, Jesse, what relative humidity
are we at?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the way to find this out is by
starting at the bottom and saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is 0% relative humidity, 10 is the
next line up, 20, 30, 40, 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just below 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just below 50?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at about 48% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, you got it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Confirmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Audit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, without looking at that board,
don't look, look down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye, aye, Captain.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the dew point at this condition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Remembering, the dew point is along the
right side of your chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the axes that goes straight up
and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right side of your chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 72.
[SPEAKER_02]: 72?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who agrees with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Vatsal, do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say, Vatsal?
[SPEAKER_02]: 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, what do you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: 72.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we have a consensus.
[SPEAKER_02]: 72.
[SPEAKER_02]: 72.
[SPEAKER_02]: 72.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, we found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, to reiterate, at 72 degrees,
if we take the same condition air and drop
[SPEAKER_01]: it to 72 degrees, anything below that
water will start condensing out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we took any surface also that's below
72 degrees into 95 degree air at 48%
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity, water is going to
condense on anything 72 degrees and below
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the air hits that surface, the air gets
closer and closer to the temperature of
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing that is 72 degrees or less and
that is where moisture will condense.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens at night when the temperature
drops?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at night when the temperature drops,
what happens most often when we find dew
[SPEAKER_02]: on our cars is that the radiative effect
of losing all the energy out into space
[SPEAKER_02]: cools the surfaces on the ground,
including your metallic surfaces on your
[SPEAKER_02]: car.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the dew on your car is because the
surface of the car got below the dew point
[SPEAKER_02]: of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, where did this chart come from,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, who's like, okay, we need a chart
that looks like this because this will be
[SPEAKER_02]: easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the places you can start is not at
air with zero water in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is molecules and getting rid of
molecules is actually a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we can do is make saturated air
very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can spray moisture into the air and come
up with a saturated condition at almost
[SPEAKER_02]: any temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spray water inside of a box and I slowly
heat the box up until it gets to whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature I want to measure it at and
then I can take a look at the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: water inside that box and say,
okay, this box at this temperature holds
[SPEAKER_02]: this much moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they did this for a number of
different temperatures of air and they
[SPEAKER_02]: came up with a humidity ratio which said
for every pound of air that I got inside
[SPEAKER_02]: this box, I end up with 19.4 grains per
pound of moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: At full saturated conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 40 degrees, at 55.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice as the temperatures go
up, it's not a five degree increase,
[SPEAKER_02]: five degree or five grains per pound
increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts there, it doesn't end there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what happens when we take these points
and put them on a chart?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that chart is temperature in one
direction and grains per pound of moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: in the y direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start here, I say this is my humidity
ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no moisture in the air at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 20, 40, 60, it's just an arbitrary
scale of grains per pound of moisture on
[SPEAKER_02]: the left side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I say this is my temperature,
25 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the x
[SPEAKER_02]: direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these are 100% saturated air
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I plot them, they look like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is our 100% relative humidity
curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start with this line because it's
very easy to generate those conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: experimentally, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know where you are,
if you don't know where you are on the
[SPEAKER_02]: psychrometric chart, when you go to do an
experiment and set up a chart like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to go in one direction or the
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could take all the water out,
you could put all the water you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: can in by constantly misting the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they did here and that's how
they discovered this 100% relative
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity line curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, I take the distance from here
to here at any one point from the curve to
[SPEAKER_02]: zero along this line and I divide it into
tenths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where I get my relative
humidity curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, my relative humidity curves on this
chart, if I go in, it looks like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: all very curved.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I go in a straight line down,
there is an equal distance between each
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature line crossing the relative
humidity curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that follow?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we get the term relative
humidity from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a fraction of the humidity of the
air relative to the total amount of air,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the total amount of moisture the air
can hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get to 100% conditions,
I know that I can no longer hold any more
[SPEAKER_02]: water in the air than is saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does this have to do with dry
bulb, wet bulb, dew point relative
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have the exact same amount of
moisture inside the air at a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What changes when we go to map these
points?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in this case, the only absolute
measure of moisture in the air is the dew
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else will change as we move
along this line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at saturated conditions, let's say
we're at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here, we're at a 60 degree dew
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our wet bulb temperature, if you look at
your chart, is also 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm swinging around a wet sock in the air
hoping it'll cool off the bulb through the
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporative cooling effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have all the moisture in the air
that the air can handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no water coming off the bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature of the air sensibly is the
temperature of the air from a latent or
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture latent perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 100% saturation gives us the dry bulb
temperature, the wet bulb temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the dew point temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say I want to take a box of air at
these conditions, and I'm not going to add
[SPEAKER_02]: any water to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already got all the water it has in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I start to heat up the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I let it expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at balloon only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I start to move away, I'm not adding
water energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm adding temperature energy,
meaning the heat, sensible heat energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start moving along this line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't added any absolute more moisture
into my balloon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead, we keep the amount of water in
that volume constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We increase the dry bulb temperature from
60 to 62.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well now, if I swung my wet bulb
thermometer in there, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: some temperature less than 62 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So 62 degrees is a dry bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it in a wet sock, and now I'm
spinning it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of being 62 degrees, it's going to
come down from 62 because some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: water can evaporate off the sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bulb gets cooler, and now we're at
60.8.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dew point is still 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where are we on the relative humidity
curve?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're no longer at saturation conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at 92% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving along the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: We heat up the air even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to 75 degrees Fahrenheit dry bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: 75 degrees Fahrenheit dry bulb equates to
65.2 on the wet bulb scale, but we're
[SPEAKER_02]: still at 60 degrees on the dew point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dew point hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no more or less moisture going
into our volume of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we've done is heat it with sensible
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, the temperature goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wet bulb has changed because now if I
slung the wet sock inside of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would cool the bulb off significantly
from 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our relative humidity line, we're only 60%
of the way up the curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: This water, sorry, this volume of air at
this condition could hold a lot more water
[SPEAKER_02]: now that we've added temperature energy to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, our last point.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wet bulb is 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dew point is 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a relative humidity perspective,
we're only 37% of the way of this
[SPEAKER_02]: theoretical line until we hit the
saturation point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this line continued all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go pretty far off the television.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty exponential, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk about what happens when we
add sensible heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start at a condition that's saturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're adding sensible heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensible only heat, which is
temperature-based heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with moisture
addition into the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens when we turn the lights on
and there are no plants in the room,
[SPEAKER_02]: no people in the room, it is a dry box
with hot electric toasters that make
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sensible addition of heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: These relative humidity curves,
like I said before, they indicate as we go
[SPEAKER_02]: up, in a very exponential way,
how much water the air could hold at
[SPEAKER_02]: saturation and any place on here,
how much more water it could hold if we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The properties of air are such that this
humidity ratio here, also could be
[SPEAKER_02]: referred to as the dew point, matches a
dry bulb and matches a relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use any one of these points to find
a way around this chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier today we talked about,
well, I don't only have the conditions for
[SPEAKER_02]: the room, all I have is dry bulb and wet
bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of different ways to play
on this chart to figure out exactly which
[SPEAKER_02]: way we can go, exactly where we'll find
ourselves on the chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, people need to understand that
humidity ratios, dew points, relative
[SPEAKER_02]: humidities, wet bulbs, and dry bulb
temperatures, we only need two out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seven or eight different ways that we
measure air's properties to find our way
[SPEAKER_02]: onto the chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, okay, we've talked about dry
bulb, we've talked about wet bulb,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've talked about dew point, absolute
humidity numbers, relative humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wet bulbs, dry bulbs, dew points,
also humidity ratio, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the properties of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one more we need to talk about,
which is, as you heat air up, it occupies
[SPEAKER_02]: more cubic feet per pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if I took air and I'm moving air
through a fan at a certain temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I cool that air down and I want
to move the exact same volume of air
[SPEAKER_02]: through a fan, I'm going to be moving
heavier air relative to, respective to the
[SPEAKER_02]: volume if I change the temperature in one
direction or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing you'll find on these lines
are specific volume, cubic feet of air for
[SPEAKER_02]: every pound of air that you want to move,
okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this comes into play when we start
talking about the, we start talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: moving air around the fan laws,
fan energy, and actually what we're really
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about is how much moisture we can
fit into air at higher to higher
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice that as we move along this
line here, the cubic feet increases,
[SPEAKER_02]: that expansion means there is more room in
a pound of air that needs to get taken up
[SPEAKER_02]: as the molecules push each other apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that extra energy allows for more
water to get into that air, and that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: the holding capacity of the air is much
higher at the higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: With respect to moisture, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all has to do with it, everything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any other lines we
want to look at except for some coiled
[SPEAKER_02]: cooling lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk about adding energy and
taking energy away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about adding sensible energy,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensible energy is dry energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature based energy is not moisture
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we call it sensible heat, and we're
going to go from left to right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We add it to a volume of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the air in this room, if there were no
people in it, if there was no moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: emitting sources, it would just be lights
in a grow room without plants or people,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we want to take that away, we go in the
opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going to cool the air down in a
sensible only manner, I'm not taking any
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture away, I don't go in this
direction, I don't go in this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't change the humidity ratio or I
don't change the dew point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just changing where I am with respect
to dry bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can add moisture directly to a space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is actually a lot harder than
you might think it is to go from the air
[SPEAKER_02]: at this room temperature and humidity to a
level straight up on this chart towards
[SPEAKER_02]: the intersection of the dry bulb and the
dew point and the wet bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually quite hard to do that
because as I add moisture into the air,
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because... What happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaporative cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding moisture to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so by adding moisture to the air,
so what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some physical property that cools
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no really better answer
than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A droplet of air, as it evaporates,
is absorbing temperature-sensible energy
[SPEAKER_02]: from the space and those water molecules
shed off of that droplet until it is all
[SPEAKER_02]: water molecules in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it dry air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that energy absorption releases the
water molecules and now all the molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: in a very homogenous way have the same
amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That energy, temperature-wise,
is lower even though the moisture content
[SPEAKER_02]: has gone up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, if I want to go from here to here,
I can do a couple things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can heat up the water as I'm shooting it
into the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what steam humidifiers do,
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they did it perfectly, they would add
no more heat than was required to take
[SPEAKER_02]: those molecules and turn them from water
into vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always end up with some huge amount of
humidification and a small amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature increase when we talk about
steam-generating humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about taking kettle elements
putting them in a box, heating up the
[SPEAKER_02]: water to boiling and shooting that steam
into a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the effect you're going to have on
the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very little temperature increase,
but a very high humidity increase.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to take moisture away,
well, in general, I have to go down in
[SPEAKER_02]: this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: To go from here to here in a straight
line, also, not one of those things that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really physically possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no media on Earth as far as I
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely none available
commercially for the work that we do in
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses and indoor grow that will take
a room at this condition and just pull
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture straight out of it without
affecting the temperature of the air as
[SPEAKER_02]: it's doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may end up taking this air and cooling
it or putting it through a desiccant or
[SPEAKER_02]: putting it through any which way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may end up here at the end of the day,
which is what we do in a lot of our
[SPEAKER_02]: applications, but there's no way to go
straight from there to there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the net effect is if I take a point on
this chart, I apply some processes to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: from where I begin to where I end,
these arrows are our cardinal directions
[SPEAKER_02]: as to what that process ended up doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I start here and I end up here,
I humidify.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I went this way and this way or
this way and this way and this way,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I start here and I end up here,
I dehumidify.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I start here and I end up here,
like we do in so many of our growing
[SPEAKER_02]: applications, we have heated and
dehumidified our air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to get from here to here, you'll find
out we went all the way here and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go in any which direction,
any combination of directions following
[SPEAKER_02]: these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooling and dehumidifying is the one that
typically most mechanical air conditioning
[SPEAKER_02]: systems do, not including desiccant
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens when we remove sensible heat
and we see that the temperature goes down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's say that we're cooling the air
by introducing it to a surface that's
[SPEAKER_02]: colder than the dew point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to end up cooling the
air in a way that cools it below the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature at which condensation will
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: The condensation forms on that surface
that we're cooling it with, and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: end up doing some sensible and then latent
cooling as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll end up going in this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that look like in an actual
space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we need to do that with an air
conditioning system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take air from an air
conditioning system and put it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The supply air comes from an air
conditioning unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It falls into the room and spins around
and is mixed inside the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That air is going to pick up the sensible
heat from, for example, the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The motors, the fans spinning inside the
room to mix the air around.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all dry, sensible energy
introduction to that air, but it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: going to pick up latent heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is not the same type of dry
temperature heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's moisture heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That moisture comes from the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are transpiring constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there is an equilibrium you're going
to get if you want to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: room temperature stays the same,
and we'll talk about how we get there
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, supply air in will pick up
sensible heat and latent heat and be
[SPEAKER_02]: returned back to the air conditioner so we
can do something to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can't match the amount of sensible
heat and latent heat added to the air as
[SPEAKER_02]: it passes through a room, we're going to
end up unable to control our room
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be able to remove both
sensible and latent heat to ensure that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't stray away from that condition
that's going to provide the plant with its
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum vitality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple ways to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that we were taught was you have a
bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm heating up that bucket, and I need to
balance the water I'm putting into that
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket to maintain a certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I remove some of that hot water,
as it all mixes inside that bucket,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is the fraction of cool, fresh water
I need to bring in to keep the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: of the bucket exactly where I want it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a bucket at a certain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I light a fire underneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm going to add some more cool water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to balance the flow of cool
water and the temperature of that water so
[SPEAKER_02]: I can maintain the temperature of the
bucket I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that engineers use to talk about
the balance of both sensible energy
[SPEAKER_02]: removal and latent energy removal is
called the sensible heat ratio,
[SPEAKER_02]: is by picking apart the total amount of
energy we take out of the air in both
[SPEAKER_02]: forms and saying what fraction of that is
done on the temperature side versus the
[SPEAKER_02]: latent side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put air into a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes up 10 degrees Fahrenheit on my
dry bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes up 15 grains per pound on my
sensible heat ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put those numbers into a
common unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take that common unit,
add it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing what I know from the
temperature into the room, the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving the room of that air, I'm going to
take that sensible heat gain and divide it
[SPEAKER_02]: by the total heat gain going through that
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, these numbers here, the sensible heat
gain and the latent heat gain,
[SPEAKER_02]: are dictated by equations called the
sensible and latent heat equations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to go over those right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is there is a way
that we can take both types of energy
[SPEAKER_02]: addition and make them into the same
common unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in doing so, we can come up with a
ratio of how much of the energy we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: remove is sensible and how much is latent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to look at your chart,
and you're going to notice that there is
[SPEAKER_02]: this sensible heat ratio around the
outside, around the outside, around the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is all referenced to an index point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That index point, you'll find a little dot
in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that dot, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me that temperature and the wet bulb
with that dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures of
that dot.
Booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we looking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we looking at the wet bulb chart right
here in the green?
[SPEAKER_02]: Take this dot and follow the green line
all the way over to the wet bulb line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, you get that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how we got there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the relative humidity there,
Brian?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got you.
Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, is it 50% relative humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I take a volume of air and do something
to it, and I end up going from this point
[SPEAKER_02]: to some other point here, the angle
between those two points can be lined up
[SPEAKER_02]: with an angle between our index point and
a sensible heat ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have this chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to know necessarily what the
ratio is going into the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can look at a process and say,
hey, we start here and we end up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what percentage of the energy being
added is sensibly based and what of it is
[SPEAKER_02]: latently based?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is sensible and how much is
latent?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use this chart by taking the two
points and the angle between them and then
[SPEAKER_02]: corresponding them to this index point and
the angle it forms with this indices on
[SPEAKER_02]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will tell me how much sensible
energy is added or taken away,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much latent energy is added or taken
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some of the more
interesting things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have some amount of temperature being
taken away that is 100% sensible and zero
[SPEAKER_02]: latent, what is my sensible heat ratio?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start at this point right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take away sensible energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go directly in the leftward
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: What angle am I making with the indices?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I correlate that to my sensible
heat ratio number here, it's a 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear the sensible heat
ratio term get thrown around a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a term we use every single
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say it's a relic, but it's
definitely not terms that we use in the
[SPEAKER_02]: HVAC industry every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're more prone to hear vapor
pressure deficit, which is a much more
[SPEAKER_02]: complex term than sensible heat ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you really want to know what your
air conditioners are doing, you could take
[SPEAKER_02]: a temperature and humidity sensor at two
points and go, oh, this is how much
[SPEAKER_02]: sensible energy is being taken away.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how much water energy is being
taken out versus how much latent energy is
[SPEAKER_02]: being taken out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The steeper I go, the smaller the number
gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I start here and I go here at the
end of my process, I've got a very small
[SPEAKER_02]: sensible heat ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turns out that going in this
direction from here down, it corresponds
[SPEAKER_02]: to 0.15 or 0.2 on the sensible heat ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means of the energy that's been
removed going in this direction,
[SPEAKER_02]: a small fraction of it, 15% or 20% of it,
is temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest is humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% is humidity removal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the numbers get very small very quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of energy to take water out
of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be the takeaway here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my sensible heat ratio climbs up
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time you get below 0.8 or 0.75 in this
direction, you've basically moved outside
[SPEAKER_02]: of comfort cooling and the world that we
live in in commercial air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we start getting into greenhouse stuff
and indoor gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steep curves is what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to take a lot of water away and
most likely not a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be a lower sensible heat
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about how to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can follow this line.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an interesting thing about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if I also happen to calculate this
many lights in the room and this much
[SPEAKER_02]: water coming out of the room, I can also
determine how much my sensible heat ratio
[SPEAKER_02]: has to be for me to adequately keep this
space at the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I know the ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take the point I'm trying to
maintain and draw a line at this rate away
[SPEAKER_02]: from it as I'm taking energy away from
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I do it, the further I get,
the less of the air I need to process in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room to maintain this condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take all the air in this room and I
want to keep it at 70 degrees,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is in here, and 50% relative
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I blast air through this room like a
tornado and I take away just a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of energy with each passing second,
I'm just going to change the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: and the humidity of the air a small
fraction before I reintroduce it back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to make much temperature or
humidity change to the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: If all I did was put a tiny tube and suck
a little bit of air out, condition it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then send it back in, well,
I would need to make that air very cold
[SPEAKER_02]: and very dry to get rid of all the heat
and the humidity that's being generated in
[SPEAKER_02]: this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about what the implications are
for our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants, love, consistent temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I take small tubes of highly
conditioned air and drop very cold air
[SPEAKER_02]: into the room at different spots,
before the air gets a chance to mix,
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be a microclimate created
everywhere I drop that cold air in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like whoever is complaining at
the reception desk because it's so cold
[SPEAKER_02]: and why can't we adjust the thermostat,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I create that drop of air, cold air
dropping onto the plant, that plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'd rather do instead is keep the air
coming in as close to the room temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the reason in commercial air
conditioning, we do four, three,
[SPEAKER_02]: five air changes per hour, which is how
many times I take the air in the room and
[SPEAKER_02]: pass it through an air conditioning system
in an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: In ag, so we do this kind of cooling and
delivery of air in commercial comfort air
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioning systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do this in gross, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move 20 to 30 times the
air, 20 or 30 times in an hour,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to change it out and replace
it with conditioned air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I say replaced, it's just the same air
being cycled back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take CO2 laid in the air,
we're not going to bring in outside air
[SPEAKER_02]: and replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same air we're going to take it
out, condition it, and send it back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the conditions that we send it back in
at have better be close to the room
[SPEAKER_02]: condition so that we don't cause those
microclimates wherever we're dropping the
[SPEAKER_02]: air back in space, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that intuitively make sense anyways?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cause we kind of need to maybe think
about it for a while, but I can either
[SPEAKER_02]: send in very cold air and a small amount
of it in different spots or I can move a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of air and not send it back in at a
temperature that is so far from where it
[SPEAKER_02]: started from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that why having independent
stand-alone dehumidifiers in the grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't the best strategy?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of reasons for that and
they have to do with compressor dynamics
[SPEAKER_02]: and the heat of compression of refrigerant
gases and where you go with all that
[SPEAKER_02]: excess energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of those reasons that yet
definitely you don't want the pockets of
[SPEAKER_02]: hot air sitting around the greenhouse or
inside your ag space.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many more reasons that hot air
comes out of the dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_02]: it floats, that hot air that's been heated
and dehumidified is hot and it's staying
[SPEAKER_02]: up there unless you have another fan to
blow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now instead of having just my
dehumidifier, I've got a dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a fan, that fan has to blow it
down, has to do it a distributed way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where if you hit it hit that hot
air straight down, yeah you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a problem where one plant is probably
in an ideal condition and right beside it
[SPEAKER_02]: the other plant's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant is very highly stressed and is
prone to pathogen development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature, all different types of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Densities of air changing as we go hot and
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about how we process air
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we change temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooling, heating, humidification,
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was at any other starting point and I
knew my sensible latent balance,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go to my new starting point using
the ratio line that I drew, the 60%,
[SPEAKER_02]: the .6 sensible heat ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Translate it up and know that I had to
deliver air somewhere along this line here
[SPEAKER_02]: to counteract the energy balance in my
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a well engineered room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know exactly what the lights are doing,
where the moisture is coming from,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use this line to tell me,
boy I need to deliver air here in a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of it or I need to deliver air here in
a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the tricky part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't cool air in straight lines and
follow the sensible humidity ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, I cool air by going through 4
inch to 12 inch cooling coils.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cooling coil is a big metal box with
fins and I'm passing through those fins a
[SPEAKER_02]: coil of chilled water or boiling
refrigerant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes the fins very cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: My air comes through and as it's coming
through, let's say I was at this point,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I put air through a cooling coil,
the radiator on your car, except with cold
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the air passes through the cooling
coil, we start to drop temperature very
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't drop humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That air hasn't gotten to the saturation
point yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't gotten to that wet ball
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I get to the wet ball temperature,
the moisture starts to fall out as I
[SPEAKER_02]: approach it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to hit it, but as I approach
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it starts to fall out and get colder
and colder and colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, my sensible heat ratio has been met.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want an air on this line and I want
this air here, but I have to go all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way here to get it and then heat it back
up sensibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I determine that I need this point of
air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do this amount of air changes through a
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get from here to here directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to cool the air first and then heat
it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends, this is brute force
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say brute force dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am using a source of cold, which is very
hard to generate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to cool my air well past the
temperature I need it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only need air right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only need air at 65, 16 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I need it at a humidity ratio of 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to get from here, which is 70,
down to here, which is 16 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit and 60 grains per pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go all the way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool that air down to 52 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then reheat it all the way back up to
60.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is illegal if we're using new forms
of energy to do that reheating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in the industry, what we do is we use
a compressor to compress refrigerants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heat of that compression is used to
drive the reheating effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed the compressors to run anyways
because we had to get them to expand
[SPEAKER_02]: refrigerants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used refrigerant gases to make the cold
surface on the coil to dehumidify in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really wasting all that much
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are using a lot of energy going
from this point to this point because my
[SPEAKER_02]: compressor is responsible for going all
the way down here, making the air all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way this cold, and then reheating it back
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reheating is free as far as we're
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to run the compressors
anyways to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we're adding toasters in the
airstream or electric resistance heaters.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not adding natural gas burners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just using the compressor energy we
were going to send to the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: The reheat is free, but the cooling is
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, the design of
refrigerant systems means that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: basically only reheat to about 10 degrees
below what my starting condition was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditional reheat systems just don't make
the air any hotter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are conditions we'll talk about
in later parts of this video series that
[SPEAKER_02]: will show you we need to go not just to 68
degrees, not to 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to get to 85, maybe even 90
degrees if we want to keep the room at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same temperature, the same VPD,
the same everything that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain so the plants have a consistent
environment and the maximum vitality.
Thank you for watching and
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see you next time.
Bye-bye.
