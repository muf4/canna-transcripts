[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm here with Scott Wall and Jenny
Garley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you from New Age Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You came in all the way from Michigan and
you're in NorCal in the Salinas area,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you both just presented and I only
caught the end of yours and there are
[SPEAKER_03]: specific topics that I want to talk about,
but can you kind of give like a recap of
[SPEAKER_03]: the key points you wanted people to take
away from your presentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went over why sap is important,
how does it differ from tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke down the different components of a
sap analysis, looked at especially
[SPEAKER_00]: mobility, trace elements, cations,
anions, the balances, synergism,
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonism and then nitrogen reduction
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody can look at a sap analysis and
not just see a whole bunch of bars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but have an understanding of each nutrient
so they can take it to the next level with
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think of kind of tools in a
toolkit, there's like soil samples,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's plant sap analysis, there's tissue
analysis and in terms of like I think a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people kind of want to get a sense
of that round trip of I know it's in my
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, I know how successful my plants are
and up taking whatever is in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you kind of talk about the... There's
Eric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric, come here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to tap in for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just started asking the very first
question, which was around Jenny's
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric, sit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he was a clapper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you I would have Eric tap in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, tap it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you find?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were your takeaways from Jenny's
talk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm definitely into analyzing and
lab testing and I find that a lot of farms
[SPEAKER_02]: in commercial cannabis don't test anything
for any amount of whatever they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the explanation of how it's collected
and how the process that you guys use is
[SPEAKER_02]: really, I think, informative and important
and I think more people, if they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how easy sometimes this process
is and how valuable it is, they'd do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people turn it into a
headache and I find a lot of farms are
[SPEAKER_02]: more pessimistic than they are optimistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they look at ways that something
won't work before they even try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like as a consultant,
that's one of the tougher challenges is to
[SPEAKER_02]: get people to be optimistic about new
things and data and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I think that was a great aspect
of your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we, you know, I mean, we're
talking about cannabis today, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But a perfect example, like in
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago, I had a blueberry grower come
and talk to me about the fact that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were losing $225,000 a year in soft fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put together a plan that would have
cost about $15,000 a year for SAP analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: on 11 different fields that would have
been indicators for them to improve their
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The response back from that grower was,
well, that's too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was unwilling to pay $15,000 on a
plan that would have helped him remove a
[SPEAKER_01]: loss of a quarter of a million dollars in
lost revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like an insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you're buying a $15,000
insurance policy, basically.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to listen into your
presentation as well, because you brought
[SPEAKER_02]: up a couple of key factors and it wasn't
necessarily on the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I resonated with was the fact
that a lot of things look good on paper
[SPEAKER_02]: and that doesn't do shit out on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get out there and nothing works right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Workflow, whatever it is, it's just not
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks great on paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really is a testament to the
wrong people designing and dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't farmers in the first place,
maybe real estate investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can raise money, but putting together
a farm is really out of everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: league.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see it, I think, at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It bites them in the ass a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, the thing was,
put the legacy grow away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew what we were doing in legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we went to legalize cannabis,
there are a whole lot of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped into industry state by state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time it phased in, a whole new group
of people jumped into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Builders, HVAC people, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people with predatory
behaviors in all those industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you see grows, you see amendments,
you see HVAC, you see irrigation that
[SPEAKER_01]: might have been fine for the industry that
that person was associated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it maybe made sense on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the investor or the person that had
the money said, OK, I'll buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't make sense when in
practicality.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give a greenhouse example of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: HVAC, like a traditional HVAC system with
chillers and air handlers going into a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, which typically isn't part of
greenhouse technology in traditional ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's wet walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's passive or natural ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not HVAC because tomatoes aren't
worth that much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a great crop, but they're not
worth as much as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so cannabis went into this area of
more is more, you know, like here at these
[SPEAKER_02]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're all talking about in some
cases is less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the industry started taking a more is
more approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with controlled environment
agriculture, it was like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want more control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're putting more equipment in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the equipment suppliers never done the
math on something like that because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no calculations for HVAC was
something that has solar gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing equipment that's
underpowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relationships are broken because the
people that bought the stuff are pissed at
[SPEAKER_02]: the people supplying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people supplying it are like,
hey, we've never done that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a vicious cycle of everybody
wanting to help each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're doing it out of a pretense of
maybe trying to, you know, set new
[SPEAKER_02]: standards, set new records, make a name
for themselves, or just make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: money real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in for the kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, come out of it going, oops,
we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe that wasn't such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is, every time we we
legalize in a new state, the the price per
[SPEAKER_01]: pound, the price point is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So business plans are based on this really
big price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can afford anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you design these things and they
don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The IPM is terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you get powdery mildew occurring every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't control the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The investors now the price point starts
going down because more and more people
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not harvesting what you thought you
were going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting the price that you
thought you were going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're having to buy more technology to
treat for mediocre cannabis, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the business plan doesn't work and
the investors are getting pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're firing management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're getting this cycle that is
just it feeds on itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like cannibalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those facilities are I think are just
doomed to failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the new states that are
coming on board need to really be
[SPEAKER_01]: examining what's going on in the other
states and say, OK, look, we know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get to a point where our price
point is going to be eight hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your business plan based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out what you're how you're going to
get return on investment based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and look at the failures in those
other states and plan accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't plan on and if you're making you're
selling at twenty five hundred dollars a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that money and bank it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go buy new escalades and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, bank it because you're going to
need it someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your S.O.P.s right and stick to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't blame everything on the guys that
are on the shit rolls downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, don't always blame the guy below
because a lot of times the problems occur
[SPEAKER_01]: at the top of the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the guy that doesn't know a thing
about grow, but he's the one to put the
[SPEAKER_01]: money in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they come in and they make a lot of
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they don't know a thing about
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think what happens, too,
is originally they start out, like you
[SPEAKER_02]: said, and then they hire a bunch of people
that blew a lot of smoke up their ass
[SPEAKER_02]: because they can talk a bunch of cannabis
talk and plant talk, but really don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the book book experienced and
trained really well and they can recite a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about LinkedIn last night
and there was somebody in the comments and
[SPEAKER_02]: they said something about a master grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, that's kind of made a joke
in the comments back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, master grower, L.O.L.
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dude was like, well, maybe the
terminology is different out there in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, but we grow the best pot here
in Colorado and, you know, master by
[SPEAKER_02]: master growers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, man, OK, enjoy the little
bubble you live.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, what ends up happening,
though, is upper management feels like
[SPEAKER_02]: they have to take over and make all these
decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of times what we're seeing
also is that the beginning of everything
[SPEAKER_02]: failed because they didn't vet the people
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't know how in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of these people made their
money in real estate and other businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, OK, now we're going to
shift to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything really falls apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, number one,
because they didn't know how to vet
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then number two, they try to take
control of the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because originally they are the smarter
people of the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they compound it with making
terrible decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on what they learned on Instagram or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think that's that's exactly
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're in we're in an industry
right now that is trying to produce a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be our goal is to produce
exceptional cannabis at the lowest at the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest cost per pound so that we make a
good margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we're actually doing is
producing a lot of mediocre cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not always at a good margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in California, I hate to say
it, because this is where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, that's where my heart
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, it's getting a little
boofy or midsy out here because the price
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis and the way that the
legalization has turned, people have to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow cheaper and cheaper, which has caused
a big learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, switching to regenerative ag is
a great idea and living soil and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does come with a little bit of a
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that maybe were regenerative ag or
maybe just organic, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily regenerative and living
soil, but they switched to cocoa and
[SPEAKER_02]: salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legacy growers up north that really always
grew from seed, never had a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on a hype strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go and buy a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's really grown clones before and
understand the sensitivity that has.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a learning curve there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, this last year was the
year of we can't fuck anything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has got to go perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually the year of tons of
fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a really unfortunate,
disastrous year for a lot of the learning
[SPEAKER_02]: curve farms, I guess you could say,
in some of those categories and in other
[SPEAKER_02]: areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great year because we had such a
long, warm summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have the early rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the growers were able to get a
great crop in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, in between all that were
a bunch of learning curves and stumbling
[SPEAKER_02]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really great to have this
event again, because some of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: conferences, you know, aren't happening
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I find is that the trade shows used
to be centered around the growers back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the days, Max Shield and some of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's all shifted towards the
investment and upper management and these
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of flashy showy things like MJ
BizCon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to be able to have this and,
you know, speak to the farmers and engage
[SPEAKER_02]: is really great because you can only do
that in January and February also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, everybody's busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody's really thirsting for info
because they're in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think that's what we're,
you know, when I'm talking with grows and
[SPEAKER_01]: typically a lot of times when they ask us
to come in to start with SAP analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually they've got a problem to start
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody usually starts with SAP analysis
when everything's going right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not get called and said everything
is an amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to throw this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the thought is,
OK, we're going to fix everything all at
[SPEAKER_01]: one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it's never that's never a good
science as a as a numbers nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to first convince them,
look, I see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I want you to make two lists,
make a list of all the problems you
[SPEAKER_01]: perceive in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then make a list of all your strains and
list them in priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fix this strange first,
it would make the biggest difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: your bottom line and down to the to the
lowest strain that you give the least shit
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we take those two and we make a matrix
and we say, OK, we're going to work on
[SPEAKER_01]: these two strains first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the two issues we want to
tackle first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We focus on changing one parameter at a
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's science.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we can work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't want to be changing a
whole lot of different things at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that wants to change feed and HVAC
and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give an example of that in
nutrient uptake of like changing one thing
[SPEAKER_03]: to see kind of the effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Irrigate your irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think irrigation is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you have a automated
irrigation system, depending on your
[SPEAKER_01]: driving, if you if you allow too much
dryback and you're counting on good
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial growth, you drive back too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you're allowing the microbes to die
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're defeating your point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you if you don't irrigate properly,
the microbes die back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're counting on the microbes to
facilitate phosphorus mineralization in
[SPEAKER_01]: the in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you could have all the phosphorus
you want available in that root.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your uptake with sap indicates that
you have a deficiency in uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that one management practice is
affecting the uptake that you want in your
[SPEAKER_01]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that you have a deficiency in
the phosphorus uptake is opening up the
[SPEAKER_01]: door for other problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe the plant's going to take up
more chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you create an imbalance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the chloride is so high that even
if you fix the irrigation problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much chloride in the in that
one grow of 200 strength of 200 plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to now fix the fact that you've
got so much chloride uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've created a problem that created
another problem that you if you even fix
[SPEAKER_01]: the domino effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know with this solution to the first
problem, you basically work frequent small
[SPEAKER_03]: like smaller waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be more frequent smaller
waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be inappropriate for me to
ever say this is the solution to that one
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in general for all grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 250 different grow operations
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is doing it a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until if somebody calls and says,
look, we just did this SAP analysis and I
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd say, yeah, you've got this problem
in this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, well, OK, so what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, because I don't know your
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until I come and visit or we have a
in-depth conversation about what your
[SPEAKER_01]: management practices are and you have to
be 100 percent honest with me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't give you any advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't I won't even try to give you
advice to say, hey, this is I think
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we need to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're only going to work at one
parameter at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then we'll do more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's where I get in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With complete honesty, because there are
things that I don't agree with in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bro, science says this is what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so, yeah, you see, you're just going
to you're just trying to get 50 percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: the or 75 percent of people out there to
hate me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to know this is come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like Brussels grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our industry as a whole has come to the
understanding that we need to defoliate
[SPEAKER_01]: and we defoliate hard, particularly in in
controlled environmental agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our indoor grows, where basically
our HVAC systems cannot handle humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the engineers engineering is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the plant that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the IPM that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the engineering that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We at three weeks and probably at 40 at 21
days and at 42 days, we go in and we we we
[SPEAKER_01]: call it training and we call it
defoliating and we pull all these leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we would take out lateral branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The factories of the plant, OK,
those leaves are the only place that that
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant can produce organic molecules,
but the very thing that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sugars, terpenes, THC, enzymatics,
proteins, all these things can produce in
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: There also are solar cells that collect
the energy that we're paying electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we go in and we take
them all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we spent money on energy and
amendments and everything to grow that
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leaf is holding mobile nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we strip it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We throw away money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We throw away the factories that are going
to make that plant healthier and stronger
[SPEAKER_01]: and more terpenes and more THC,
more bud, more bud swell, because it all
[SPEAKER_01]: has to come from the factories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell the growers, stop defoliating,
not entirely, just enough to maintain good
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about your example of the
lower leaves that they only get 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I want to say what a mobile
nutrient is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're throwing away those older
leaves and Scott said throwing away
[SPEAKER_00]: mobiles, your mobile nutrients is NPK
magnesium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those, if you're paying money to put
those in the leaves, when you defoliate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also throwing them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a mobile.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium immobile.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where calcium deficiency is seen at the
top of the leaf as where mobile nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies are seen at the bottom of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so many growers,
when I go through and I do a tour,
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually have like four or five people
and there's there's junior growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's there's the head cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, well, shouldn't I shouldn't
I clean out these leaves on the inside
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's causing shadowing and so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've measured I've measured light
absorption in the inside and it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: 200, you know, photon flux units in the
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's only 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up here at the top, it's 800 or a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah, but if you take that out,
that's 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 200 that you don't capture ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just goes to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capture it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That leaf is going to get that 200 and
turn it into something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why we put the mylar
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, an oak tree or, you know,
a plant growing out in a forest doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: just drop all the leaves on the inside of
its canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps every leaf so long as it's got
nutrients, it keeps that leaf because
[SPEAKER_01]: every little bit of UV energy that it can
collect goes towards its production of
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars and metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as it's green, don't start
pulling it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's starting to senesce and it's at
the bottom and you if it's there and you
[SPEAKER_01]: see the senescence, that's the language of
that plant telling you we're losing we're
[SPEAKER_01]: stripping nutrients out of that leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a deficiency problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you strip those leaves out before that
happens, you're losing some some
[SPEAKER_01]: communication with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there's no sense in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love hearing all that stuff because
yeah, more more interesting because in my
[SPEAKER_03]: growth science, I always think that that's
a natural function of like lower leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow and that's natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're saying that it doesn't always
have to be that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: A healthy plant doesn't have to get rid of
the lower leaves just because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: older.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or blocked by light.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because UV light particles don't
behave the way we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's in shadow doesn't mean
it's not for getting light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means it's getting less UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: But absorbing any UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when we talk about like the
spectra on these lights, they go from 300
[SPEAKER_01]: to 800, you know, that big broad spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to collect as much of it as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bouncing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's pick up as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people say, well,
that leaves cause it taking more energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking energy away from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That leaf already was grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's collecting energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's feeding that bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's when it starts dying out,
the plants actually taking nutrients away
[SPEAKER_01]: from it and taking it to the bud or to
that new growth point, then you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need that leaf anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're also figuring out that you've
got some other issues going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we take all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take all that stuff away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at 42 days, when we're really in the
home stretch and we should be looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient uptake, we've stripped so many
leaves away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost impossible to figure out what
our nutrient uptake is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I totally agree with training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think there's some cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen cannabis bonsai trees
and I think I think they're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a ton of stuff we can do
with with training to open up light paths
[SPEAKER_01]: to the center of a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, can we afford the labor
to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in my laboratory, the biggest
cost in my facility is labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifty percent of my cost comes from labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when we're trying to struggle for
cost, return on investment and cost per
[SPEAKER_01]: price per pound, these facilities that
have eight, ten people in a section
[SPEAKER_01]: working two days a week pulling leaves off
the plants, that to me looks like a labor
[SPEAKER_01]: savings someplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's minimize some of that cost right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we've got an IPM issue,
let's figure out what the real cause of
[SPEAKER_01]: that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's a fungal issue,
if it's a yeast and mold issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out your vectors of how that's
getting into the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we build these fancy,
super elaborate, controlled environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we put on scrubs,
we put on, you know, if I go visit,
[SPEAKER_01]: they make me put on Tyvek, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go through an air booth and I put on
booties and I walk in and.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see growers handling plants without
gloves on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk about swabbing and we talk
about all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know, you worry about
protritus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see anybody here with a face mask
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protritus is on your skin and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get these things out,
figure out what your vectors are for these
[SPEAKER_01]: things that get into your get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you were a food processing
facility as a food safety consultant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see your food safety plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to know what your traffic
patterns are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a CAA, you've got a loading dock
because you're receiving materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sometimes those materials need to go
into your grow facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have two different pallet jacks?
[SPEAKER_01]: One for your dock and a clean one that
only goes into your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the one from your dock that
went on the truck and trucks are dirty,
[SPEAKER_01]: also goes down the hallway to your in your
growth, your flower rooms, you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a vector that that brings in path
that just because that truck went to other
[SPEAKER_01]: farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that other farms pallet
jack went on that truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to look for vectors for
protritus and hoplatin virus and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the stripping is a huge hoplatin
viroid, you know, spreader event,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically, because you have all these
people in there stripping all these
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves, getting all this shit all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they don't change their gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I watch people all sit there and
audit some of these processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's break time.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, everybody's touching the door handles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's touching everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the workers, it's amazing how
they want to save gloves or protect,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like they're going to save the
farm a couple of bucks by reusing the
[SPEAKER_02]: gloves or putting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so going from strain to strain,
same plucking is a lot of what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: saying also about having too many strains
in one room because they don't all eat and
[SPEAKER_02]: drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same and a lot of the farms try to
claim that they're data driven,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're not because they're growing
all the same strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what eats and drinks
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not doing any of the testing that
you guys provide or any of that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only data driven I find is that
they're monitoring their drybacks and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not even doing that right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like to your point, you know,
the drybacks of this big, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: achievement to try to get to, which is a
lack of moisture in the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lack of mobility for new
nutrients in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like you were saying for the first
steps of things, I'm kind of in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the plants aren't looking good,
let's make sure that irrigation is right
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're hydrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then secondly, then we can start to
look at, okay, if the hydration is right
[SPEAKER_02]: and we don't see a change for the better
or things are still continuing,
[SPEAKER_02]: we move on to maybe the nutrients and
definitely sending things in for testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, a lot of people will be
pessimistic and say the testing or not
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to look at the testing because of
the closest lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't really give you any kind of
results that anybody knows how to
[SPEAKER_02]: decipher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then that gets thrown out the
window and it really gets tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stripping of the plants has gotten
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know if it's Instagram or
what's caused everybody to go to this
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy amount of stripping, but it's
happened to be from here to the East Coast
[SPEAKER_02]: with farms that, you know, we'll even say
at times, well, we have to do it or the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants will get PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I look at the plants and they're
covered in PM at Lake Flower and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you get, how does that hold up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how can that, you know, reasoning
stand, hold water if your plants already
[SPEAKER_02]: have PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like stripping them down and releasing
of the solar panels is what I call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The factories, those solar panels,
like they're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once they're gone, it takes a week
or two to regenerate and to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our veg times turn into three to
four weeks rather than two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody kind of wonders why things
are slow or why the diseases or problems
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I'm just floored at how many
people plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we get into the nursery,
they're cutting off all the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the money is in the branches and bud
sites and there is time to cut that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: off later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go into the nursery in veg and
start cleaning things up, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: and skirting and all this bullshit,
you've cut away all kinds of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you end up having the stretch go
on, you fucked yourself even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's plenty of time to determine
that in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaning some things up is, is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an okay thing to do, but how soon
do you do it before, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have viable options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the growers are getting beat
down by upper management for hitting a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are you going to hit that number if
you're in there cleaning shit up all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time and cutting things away?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you value your job?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was me, I wouldn't kill any plants
because of pests or pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't strip shit hardly off unless I
really knew that it was a something that
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't going to make anything because you
got to hit some numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if an upper management comes to
you later and you're hitting your numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're concerned about A to B ratio,
that's another thing to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now everybody's concerned about
hitting these numbers and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's what the case is,
then why is the strip so important?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, do we not realize the
health of the plant is compromised with
[SPEAKER_02]: the cross section of a pathogen or viral
spread that goes on?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like two wrongs don't make it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think that that's we have such
a big information highway and where the
[SPEAKER_01]: information comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at a scientific paper,
you always have to look at who paid for
[SPEAKER_01]: the research, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Instagram and LinkedIn and all
these, we never look at who's giving the
[SPEAKER_01]: message and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that message coming from that
person who's behind the message?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I.P.M., when you pay for Zyritol or
whatever, there's a there's money behind
[SPEAKER_01]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to badmouth products,
but there's a reason why some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things get used more and more and more
because there's there's a conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: behind using it to control something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is, a truly healthy plant a
plant that's functioning at photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: levels that are really maximized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can protect itself from a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of focusing on making truly
healthy plants that can protect
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, we focus on products that we
have to buy to apply to the plant to save
[SPEAKER_01]: it from the fact that it's not healthy and
it's being predated on by a fungus or a
[SPEAKER_01]: parasite or a thyroid or an actual pest,
aphids or thrips or something along those
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then in the grow right now,
everybody's trying to avoid these
[SPEAKER_02]: post-harvest aspergillus fails.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going in and spraying things at
harvest to avoid what might happen later
[SPEAKER_02]: based in the trim room or the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they typically spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when he brought up Zyritol,
that's a popular one to spray the day of
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people spray the day before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up until the day of harvest, where they're
pulling harvesting plants and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: dripping wet with Zyritol as they're
hanging them on carts to go out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest with you, like we talk
and you're mentioning all this effort,
[SPEAKER_02]: money and hard work that goes into these
plants and the compromising that occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all hear about that through drying
and curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hey, you overdried your weed so
you lose a lot of the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was like a rookie fuck up
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're into this level of,
OK, risk management says to do this with
[SPEAKER_02]: this really oxidizing type of a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that I'm against Zyritol and
the makers of it and the product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the process and where we've gotten to
to spray it on the day of harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: it rips the turps right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the turp burglar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the biggest say bye to your
turps before you even dry it like it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The turps are gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are trying to go by
this new education of terpenes are cooler
[SPEAKER_02]: than THC and all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, the degradation from
the time that they cut those plants by
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these practices of risk management
for post harvest fails or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: has really, you know, like I mean,
it's another damaging factor to quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's like in my talk where
I said, you know, an ounce of an ounce of
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about aspergillus or
whether we're talking about heavy metal
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out what your what is that vector?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is how is that aspect that's negating
the quality of your cannabis getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just doesn't just magically
appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis itself didn't magically make
that it had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to get transported into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a vector there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out the vectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invest the time in figuring out how these
things get there and then focus on trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to prevent that rather than trying to
always treat the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the yeah, the illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fix the fix the cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's almost like the health
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, here's all these products to
bandaid your cannabis to a harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you know, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got something for you where
something like what we're doing here and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you guys are up to is to help prevent
that to see ahead and to create a healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: system that can fight these things off
naturally so that we use less of those
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just quickly,
[SPEAKER_03]: what you notice and what they uptake at
different stages of the plant life cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you touch on some of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with SAP analysis and our databases and
just the history of what we've been doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry gives us the most
unique look at plant nutrient uptake and
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly controlled environmental
agriculture in cannabis is the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: has has opened the door and given us the
biggest epiphany moments, the aha moments,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the cannabis industry with CEA has
tried to grow multiple strains in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: flower room with the same feed with the
same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of controlled parameters,
but multiple strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we see this, we can we take a look
and we say, wait a minute, that wedding
[SPEAKER_01]: crasher in the TROP cookie and that rose
under the same conditions with the same
[SPEAKER_01]: feed are feeding totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking up nutrients differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where this one is a heavy feeder,
TROP cookie is a heavy, heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking up a lot of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at early on, it takes up so much
phosphorus that it stretches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets a huge inner nose and it'll be a
six foot, seven foot plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't hold back the phosphorus
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wedding crasher in that same room on that
same feed, if you push it where the TROP
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie will take the two five EC,
wedding crasher will burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot handle that and it'll go way
excessive and it'll accumulate and burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rose, it might be somewhere
in the middle, but that controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental agriculture has given us
such a huge window into how varietal
[SPEAKER_01]: differences appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then you can take that same thing
out to outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difficulty there being is that in a 40
acre field, you might have a huge variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of soil conditions across a 40 acre field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to know that, OK,
you can't you can't feed it all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be aware that they're going
to feed differently across that field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why everybody so screwed up a
little bit, I guess you could say,
[SPEAKER_02]: with trying to grow so many cultivars in
the same room to try to keep the menu
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse, to make the salespeople happy and
all these other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I try to put it upon
these farms to really try to figure that
[SPEAKER_02]: out, separate those things, because what
we're trying to also create is the best
[SPEAKER_02]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can't create a great outcome if
you're doing all this shit and especially
[SPEAKER_02]: not analyzing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you create the best outcome?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously with the best,
healthiest moms, you know, the same strain
[SPEAKER_02]: in the same room so that you can feed it
and irrigate it to the best of its
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't sit there and go,
oh, well, aphids love the wedding crasher,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they don't like the trop cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one doesn't take the nutrients,
you know, or isn't as healthy as the
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're they're feeding on the one
that's the weak sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the weak link.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see this in crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with all crops is that sapinellus
can show you which varieties you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: together, which varieties you can set up
rooms with similar feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not doing 20 different feeding
regimes, which is almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut back on work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut back on man hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to grow similar varieties
together, at least understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's so big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's bigger than most people really
realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's taken for granted,
especially by the grows, clearly,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's all I see is too many in
one room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, how can we calm that down a
little bit so that we can create a better
[SPEAKER_02]: outcome?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, God dang it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how it's it's glaring in my
eyes, but they're the ones running the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well, I think, you know, and that can
go all the way back to some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering and the design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the facilities were designed with
flower rooms that are so large that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't limit the number of strains in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you don't have enough moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nurseries don't hit that kind of
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so too, to your point is that taking
that data, aggregating it so that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out which ones go best together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people just go, oh, this one harvests
around the same time as that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you if you can figure out which ones
feed similarly, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if this one if this one ripens at
sixty five days and the other one ripens
[SPEAKER_01]: at at seventy five days, now you're you're
still stuck because what happens is
[SPEAKER_01]: management says, look, we've got to find a
we've got we're either going to find a
[SPEAKER_01]: medium and neither one of them is being
harvested at its perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're instead of creating it,
instead of harvesting exceptional
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, we're kind of making you know,
we're making that mediocre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
