[SPEAKER_08]: Industrial agriculture is destroying the
earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are killing our living soil,
contaminating our water, and poisoning
[SPEAKER_08]: ourselves with chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Industrial farming is one of the highest
contributors to climate change,
[SPEAKER_08]: releasing an immense amount of carbon into
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way we grow a plant has the power to
either harm or heal the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: In our current industrial extractive
model, we will continue to take until
[SPEAKER_08]: there is nothing left.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is another path we can take.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the most powerful things about
cannabis is it's a psychoactive medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what cannabis has the ability to do is
connect your mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: To connect your soul back to things that
are real.
[SPEAKER_09]: I truly believe that a plant is made out
of the soil, the water, and the air that
[SPEAKER_09]: it is surrounded by.
[SPEAKER_09]: It uses the energy of the sun to create
its physical matter out of air.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we are creating a psychoactive
plant, we are what we smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the experience that is what those
plants have created.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to connect people back to
something real, back to the source that
[SPEAKER_09]: can make us feel whole again, that can
make us feel connected with the world we
[SPEAKER_09]: live in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I came from back to the land homesteaders
who chose to go and find career paths.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got this opportunity to come back to
this dilapidated homestead when I was
[SPEAKER_09]: about 24 years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the little cabin that we lived in when
I was a baby was absorbed into the forest
[SPEAKER_09]: and trees were grown up everywhere and all
the infrastructure was falling apart.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I set about repairing and rebuilding
our homestead.
[SPEAKER_04]: We arrived in each other's lives in
Hawaii, ran into each other at a CD bar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like six months after we started
dating, you moved here and we got goats
[SPEAKER_09]: like a couple of weeks after Taylor moved
here and decided to do farmers market the
[SPEAKER_09]: next summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when we started switching our
vegetable production over to no till,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was daunting at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: The returns maybe didn't happen that first
year, even the second year as the soil was
[SPEAKER_04]: left freer of disturbance from us and got
to get more into its own true balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flavor was so much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability for that food to stay fresh,
like you would harvest it and a week later
[SPEAKER_04]: it looked like you had just harvested it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most vital, healthy, vibrant food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I want to see myself and
my family eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to see my community
eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: In each transaction, I just feel like I'm
handing them a pack of life force energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we first started farming,
you kind of just see the vegetables as the
[SPEAKER_04]: goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the deeper you get into it,
even one or two seasons into it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you start to see the reverse image.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you spend all year working on
making this perfect soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alive and complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cover crop is that vital way of continuing
to photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's pulling energy from the sun,
pulling carbon out of the air to build its
[SPEAKER_04]: structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was just watching the world make
itself out of these elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you put it back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like the most beautiful circle.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I first got here, the soil I had
to work with was 6% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And fast forward a decade of no-till
farming and we're at 24% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: That translates to 14% stable carbon.
[SPEAKER_09]: That much of an increase in a decade means
we've sequestered nearly 120 tons of
[SPEAKER_09]: carbon on an acre, or equivalent to
driving a car for 27 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a 60-acre farm here in Round
Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a really diversified farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We grow vegetables and herbs, medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have sheep and cows and chickens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up in LA, but grew up camping and
like kind of super nature science-y kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Decided to study fashion design and
thought I could change the world through
[SPEAKER_07]: textiles, changing the textile industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then realized that I really didn't want to
be a part of that industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ended up on a biodynamic farm in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had no idea what biodynamics was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that was like a huge pivotal
moment in my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Blair, I always kind of considered
myself an environmentalist, but wound up
[SPEAKER_11]: working out in the oil rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a couple other endeavors.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were very short-lived and then
farming stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the sheep have a special place
in my heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of like the first animals that
Daniel and I owned together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Having animals raised on pasture is a huge
gift to the farm and to the land.
[SPEAKER_07]: The grass is able to grow really easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: All it needs is energy from the sun and
it's able to sequester carbon into the
[SPEAKER_07]: soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: The animals then eat that grass.
[SPEAKER_07]: They then poop and pee and give back to
the earth in that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're able to use their manure in
our garden to make compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they're ready to give us their gift
of their bodies, that's I think some of
[SPEAKER_07]: the most nutritious meat out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's endless opportunities for
education for a kid on the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just being able to interact with the
animals and interact with the land.
[SPEAKER_07]: The kind of microorganisms that he's
intaking just by being able to touch the
[SPEAKER_07]: soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Touch the compost, touch the poop.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't shy away from any of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel so lucky that we're able to
provide the type of food that we are and
[SPEAKER_07]: know that he's eating the best possible
food that he can be eating and that I am
[SPEAKER_07]: too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm able to feed him through
breastfeeding, really nutritious milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I like to say I have certified
biodynamic breast milk.
[SPEAKER_11]: Earth who gives to us this food.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sun who makes it ripe and good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear earth, dear sun, by you we live.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our loving thanks to you we give.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blessings on the meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you gonna serve everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people ask me like, well what do you
do?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to try and come up with like a
few sentences to explain it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my whole life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a wildland firefighter from age 19
to 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming from the firefighting world,
I was very physical and I needed like a
[SPEAKER_05]: very physical job to fulfill that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I got into farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't help but notice that Nicholas
was on like this interesting parallel
[SPEAKER_05]: path.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in this hole, little other way,
he did everything on a bike.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would see him biking around town
like with his trailer filled with
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was bartending at this real hip cafe in
town and he was hired by the cafe to
[SPEAKER_05]: provide food.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Elizabeth was so sweet, she'd always
hook me up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how I was like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chemistry started maybe in like getting
the free stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free breakfast and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was always kind of committed to
like, I don't want it to look like
[SPEAKER_10]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause from the beginning was like,
I think the problem is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the core components of a
regenerative mindset is to understand the
[SPEAKER_10]: source of how things function.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to me, that's the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think most people are buying their
potting soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've never purchased soils to start stuff
with.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've always worked with soils from the
animal yard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a plant that's grown in a pot in
engineered soil will not express itself
[SPEAKER_10]: the same way as plants grown in this
medium.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a result of gathering resources
from the place.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it has a lot to do with why our
plants reach such a full expression.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's so biologically mature.
[SPEAKER_10]: All our fertility is essentially a result
of the animals' manures.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there we have a great source of
microbiology from the rumens of many
[SPEAKER_10]: different species of animals.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is why we don't just have one
variety of animals, but like to make sure
[SPEAKER_10]: we have several because we like knowing
that there's some donkey, some llama,
[SPEAKER_10]: some goats and some sheep and some
chickens and all the different bacterias
[SPEAKER_10]: that are formed in those guts play a role
in our soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the more diverse that is, the more
resilient I feel like this is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's, that's key.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with the wood chips.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like we try to just get one kind
of wood chip.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the more different types of wood
chips mixed together is actually the
[SPEAKER_10]: better wood chip.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a good way, I think, to establish
a relationship for the plants to the place
[SPEAKER_10]: and the source of the soil so that when it
goes out, it is already familiar with what
[SPEAKER_10]: it's going into.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what our soil looks like up on the
hill.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think terroir is just kind of a fancy
word.
[SPEAKER_10]: I simply feel like it's kind of the energy
of the place.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the terroir goes deeper in
that I think it includes the mentality and
[SPEAKER_10]: the connection of the person and people
doing the planting and the growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a lot to do with place,
and it has a lot to do also with
[SPEAKER_10]: practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we first got goats,
I was looking forward to the milk and the
[SPEAKER_04]: cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also add this incredible layer of
security to our homestead.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do brush clearing and fire safety
clearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They connected me deeply into a system of
interacting with animals and livestock
[SPEAKER_04]: that's been part of human history for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be with these animals, you see that
they know this relationship too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Industrial agriculture has viewed every
agricultural product, whether it's
[SPEAKER_04]: something we eat or something we wear,
as something to extract from the earth,
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's there to be taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll take it until it's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And regenerative agriculture sees the
farmer as one dot in this interconnected
[SPEAKER_04]: circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regenerative farming, that was the
indigenous way of existing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the original way of living on the
land.
[SPEAKER_04]: On this planet was to regenerate each
cycle, each year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to go into that year with what it
took to make the cycle happen again.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're working to create a buffer of
healthy, thriving forest around our
[SPEAKER_09]: homestead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Selectively removing trees and material
and then pile burning it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Reducing the intensity of potential fire
around our homestead.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also a project to increase the health
of the forest around our homestead too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Open up more light down to the forest
floor so we get more species that our
[SPEAKER_09]: goats can eat.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when I go through the understory
of the forest around here, I try to see it
[SPEAKER_09]: as the old growth forest it could become.
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been using fire to tend to
their environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: For thousands upon thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_09]: What Western colonialists and settlers
thought of as this beautiful, untouched
[SPEAKER_09]: wilderness was a tended garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping to bring some of that
knowledge and some of that balance of fire
[SPEAKER_09]: back to the landscape.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've recently gotten more involved in
policy work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I felt like I didn't really have
the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were kind of just in survival mode on
the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel really fortunate that I have
the opportunity to be involved in policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could I, sorry, can I, I just wanted to
ask one other thing about just getting
[SPEAKER_06]: questions to the land use attorney about
our different options moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Move to adjourn.
[SPEAKER_07]: So far the way that the legal industry has
been structured, we're just like extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: separated from the consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: The consumer goes into these dispensaries
of really no connection to what this
[SPEAKER_07]: product is in this tiny little jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really important for us to remove all
those other steps that happen between
[SPEAKER_07]: flower and the garden to flower in the
consumer's hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people understand like, hey,
maybe I don't want my flower grown under
[SPEAKER_07]: artificial lights in fake soil using
synthetic fertilizers by, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: some big corporation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I want my flower grown by people
who care, who are growing in the soil with
[SPEAKER_07]: actual sunlight and really creating
medicine that's good for me and good for
[SPEAKER_07]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some big corporate interests that
are really pushing and guiding policy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the people are really have been crying
out to say, stop, do not let this happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because that's happened all over the
state doesn't mean we want it here in
[SPEAKER_07]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_07]: When corporate businesses come in,
their sole focus is profit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're not thinking about how do
we do this in the most environmental way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're thinking about how do we do this
in the most profitable way.
[SPEAKER_07]: My great grandpa was involved in Chile
with a socialist party and kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: starting the first labor union at the
place that he worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: My grandparents, once they moved to this
country, helped people during like the
[SPEAKER_07]: Chilean coup, helped refugees coming over
and housing them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And both of my folks were really involved
in like the anti-Vietnam War movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been really instilled in me that we
have to be advocates for each other and
[SPEAKER_07]: for our communities because our
governments aren't going to do that for
[SPEAKER_07]: us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We really have to have a strong voice out
there in order to fight for our rights in
[SPEAKER_07]: this world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in academia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was studying ecology and really trying
to like delve into the depressing,
[SPEAKER_05]: sad reality of our world and how it's
degrading.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just killing me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just, my heart was breaking every
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finding regenerative agriculture gave me
all this hope.
[SPEAKER_05]: At one point in my life, I really believed
that humans were bad for the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does not have to be that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are good for the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're important for the planet.
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been an unusually dry spring,
especially in the early side.
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually we get a lot of rain in March and
April.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year it was just kind of scary
dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the actual garden space where we've
put all the carbon and been working on the
[SPEAKER_10]: increased organic matter in the soil is
actually really lush.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the beauties of growing in the
style that we do is that you have
[SPEAKER_05]: abundance just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to clear plants so that we open up
a space for a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's potatoes and onions and garlic in
the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're harvesting your potatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making space for your plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're removing your food and putting
in your medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all medicine, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Food is medicine as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just moved here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We meet a neighbor.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's this gruff old man.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was like, well, good luck growing
anything on that serpentine hillside.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were like, oh no, what does that
mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Prophecy, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those words, it's like echoed.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do have this gift of being able
to work with a piece of land, you should
[SPEAKER_05]: understand its history.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should understand what it's been
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should understand that you're dealing
with land that's been through trauma.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bonds of its caretakers have been
severed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The humans that lived here that used to
care for this area were separated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as those bonds were broken,
it's never been the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colonizing mentality came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: This property was completely re-terrorist
in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after they mined it, they logged
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you really start to understand and
see how the land reacts to your presence
[SPEAKER_05]: and how the land can regenerate and become
better, it is possible for us to make
[SPEAKER_05]: incredible change and do amazing feats of
restoration and healing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much of what that truly is is trying to
bring as much life as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Diversity, diversity, diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Diversity heals things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much happiness that you can get
by just listening to a swarm of bees just
[SPEAKER_05]: enjoy the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cacophony of their wings just getting
after the pollen and the nectar is just
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see their little saddlebags all
stuffed with pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me really happy, genuinely.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can turn this hillside into the
Garden of Eden, it's really a testament
[SPEAKER_10]: for the practices that we are committed
to.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's really what we want to try to
promote and inspire people to understand
[SPEAKER_10]: is that that land needs to be cared for.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to care for land doesn't mean you go
to the store to buy stuff to take care of
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Biodynamics has to be for
everyone, but what called to me was this
[SPEAKER_11]: way of talking about stuff in a totally
different way.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are utilizing the animal to every
extent that we can as an offering to the
[SPEAKER_11]: earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is as simple and complex as
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: By taking the time to do these simple yet
mysterious things, you're providing
[SPEAKER_11]: sustenance for Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cow manure stuffed in the cow horns is
buried in the fall equinox, spends its
[SPEAKER_07]: time underground during the winter months,
and then is dug up around the spring
[SPEAKER_07]: equinox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaka.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaka.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaka.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kaka.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just any old kaka.
[SPEAKER_06]: Baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Moo.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we dig it up in the spring,
you get this really rich, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_07]: dark, humus material.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're able to take that, stir it in
water to enliven the water and enliven the
[SPEAKER_07]: process.
[SPEAKER_11]: By doing it one way and creating chaos to
go back the other way, you are,
[SPEAKER_11]: in a sense, organizing all of the things
that you've put into that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The vortex is a significant energy force.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a spiritual side of it that you're
dealing with forces in your mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then there's the scientific side that
also says there's oxygen going in,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is feeding the microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you watch the meanderings of a river,
the way it wants to flow is actually
[SPEAKER_11]: vortexes that are traveling downstream.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of really homeopathic,
minor, small doses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Microdosing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Over time, it really starts to have a
positive effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want him to understand that,
you know, it's not necessarily about
[SPEAKER_10]: farming.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about relating.
[SPEAKER_10]: Knowing where the food is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not having some idea that food is from the
store, you know, because it's from the
[SPEAKER_10]: land.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully he's eaten peaches and just
exploring this relationship to food,
[SPEAKER_10]: because food is really one of the best
ways to connect to the earth and to the
[SPEAKER_10]: land, because we can all appreciate good
food.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't appreciate it more than when
you acquire it without going to the store
[SPEAKER_10]: to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull it hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull it down like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: See beans?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's picking berries.
See?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's eating berries off of a bush.
[SPEAKER_05]: She finds the good ones, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: She eats all the good ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: She does.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's really good at getting them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I grew up in Salt Lake City,
Utah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't be a more different cultural
setting than Humboldt, California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love to do this little thought
exercise of whisking my 18-year-old self
[SPEAKER_04]: here and showing myself that I'm raising
children on a pot farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would have, it would have seemed
insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have considered myself endangering
the children.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I try to keep that perspective in
my mind when I imagine how this looks from
[SPEAKER_04]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew up around cannabis a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: My stepdad grew and it was a big secret.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd go to school and they'd be having
the dare program where the cops would be
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to talk you into turning your
parents in for drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, talk about having the opposite of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to normalize like
what a cannabis farmer is or diversify the
[SPEAKER_07]: idea of what a cannabis farmer is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just a plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: If my kid touches a pot leaf, they're not
going to get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't treat the plant differently
than we treat our other plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't think that we have to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously edibles are a whole other,
you know, a whole other thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you're talking about a plant in a
garden, it's a completely different thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you're talking about a grape in
a vineyard and what we're still doing in
[SPEAKER_07]: this fear around it is like really
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it made us really nervous
because we were growing cannabis before
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis was regulated in the current way
that it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we started to have kids,
it was one of the reasons that it pushed
[SPEAKER_09]: us into going through compliance and
getting a legal cannabis farm is that we
[SPEAKER_09]: really didn't want our kids to grow up
with secrets.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted them to understand and be proud
of what their parents do.
[SPEAKER_09]: See it as actual work rather than hearing
from society that their parents are drug
[SPEAKER_09]: dealers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also not having to carry the
burden of a secret and the responsibility
[SPEAKER_09]: of if you mess up, it's dangerous for your
family.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just beginning to bring our summer
crops to market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cucumbers, tomatoes, zucchini,
basil, green beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Classic summer stuff that people get
really excited about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the real Tetris begins.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ate that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it tasty?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're eating that guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: He likes to call the cucumber guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this guy?
[SPEAKER_06]: How about this guy?
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking a box of these for my little
granddaughters because we happen to like
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this
[SPEAKER_10]: case, what I'm doing is I'm hunting out
the most tropical fruity candy nose I can
[SPEAKER_10]: come up with and I'm mashing genetics that
both share that same characteristic into
[SPEAKER_10]: each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the early stages and it takes
years to really develop lines.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the hunting phase.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some like rank kind of poopy,
fruity.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like your baby's been eating too much
fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This phenome right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like, I'm like, it's perfection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what else do you want?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and it stinks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, ew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So sweet gas, baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're looking at these are straw nana
frosting across that we made here with a
[SPEAKER_11]: cutting of strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the vanilla frosting.
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to be capturing both.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has the berry flavor, but then with
this like sweet icing finish.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm feeling strong vanilla right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gas and grapes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it follows me around for the rest
of the day after doing this because it's
[SPEAKER_11]: in the mustache.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, big guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm between two rows of full term seed
start cherry lime dog.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the apricot bling crossed with the
Eagle Scout train wreck.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tiny and forward, but there's this
fully fruity musk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of got me at all angles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the way Thai food has like that
sweet, savory, salty, sharp, everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: The smell version of that where it's like
fruit and pining and fuel and musk and all
[SPEAKER_09]: of it kind of coming together at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we decided to become a compliant
farm, there was this vision that we could
[SPEAKER_04]: finally meet our customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Visions of farmers market booth with our
vegetables and our cannabis and just this
[SPEAKER_04]: lovely idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made us really hopeful and excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we entered the legal market,
there were so many blocks, so many walls
[SPEAKER_04]: between us and the customers in some ways
more than before.
[SPEAKER_09]: California is created and many states that
have gone legal have created kind of like
[SPEAKER_09]: a spider web of traps of bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't take cannabis to customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to work through a distributor.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be packaged.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to get to retail.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically you have this system of
multiple places along the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every place along the way wants to take a
cut of the profit.
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of times you'll see cannabis on
the shelves in California that's over a
[SPEAKER_09]: year old because it took eight months just
to get from the farmer to the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through all the hands that it has to pass
through, the bud loses quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It loses tricone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of that was born this idea of farm
cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farm cut is minimally processed with just
the sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to share like a true farm stash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a true farm stash is a mason jar full
of untrimmed weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because it stays better that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you start breaking away your leaves to
prep it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every plant has to be tagged with a
plastic tag, with an RFID chip that
[SPEAKER_09]: becomes garbage.
[SPEAKER_09]: After you use it once.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't enjoy putting them on the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't enjoy taking them off.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't enjoy hauling them to the dump.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't enjoy getting them in the mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this difficult balance to be a
regenerative cannabis farmer in the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We care so deeply about wanting to provide
this ethical, clean product for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have to wrap it in plastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And separate it out into grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it leaves in little plastic
containers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just awful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a terrible trash producing industry
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have been endeavoring in
compostable packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And minimally processed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at an economic price.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think some of the real drive behind
the Ecoounce is like when we think about
[SPEAKER_10]: who we want to be accessing our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the people that love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to give them something that's
really high quality at a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only way you can do that is in
larger quantities.
[SPEAKER_09]: As a farmer, you make a very, very small
percentage of what the customer actually
[SPEAKER_09]: pays for that product that you've
produced.
[SPEAKER_09]: Five to six, maybe seven percent,
if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that wouldn't make sense for a
small farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Large farms can scale up enough that
profit can work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it means growing acres and acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't plan to survive as a farm under
that model.
[SPEAKER_04]: We plan to survive long enough until that
model changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that model doesn't change,
you won't see small family farms growing
[SPEAKER_04]: quality cannabis in the hills of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see massive Central Valley
commodity crop farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest marijuana greenhouse in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can produce enough pop to supply the
entire United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the classic business problem,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get the cost down and maintain
your quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we right now grow in five hundred
thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing it since 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to learn on the fly because
there was nobody growing at that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were growing in closets,
not in huge greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the person that's that built this six
million or five million five square foot
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, he's he's helping us with it
because he's grown other vegetables and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're confident that we'll be able to
do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go hang this shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go hang it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Harvest is always a exciting, joyful,
stressful time.
[SPEAKER_11]: A few years back, we had a series of cold
mornings, low 20s and lost a significant
[SPEAKER_11]: percentage of the garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: To be out there and to see the plants
covered in ice is not easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is this really happening again?
[SPEAKER_07]: We do know, like through vegetable
production, that certain plants can handle
[SPEAKER_07]: frost more than other plants and plants
can't handle it at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And luckily, cannabis is one of those
plants that can handle a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_11]: From looking droopy and sad to then just
perky and ready to greet the sun.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in a beautiful place right now where
we can reverse the damage that has been
[SPEAKER_07]: done.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a movement that has huge momentum
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And small farming is the key and
resolution to so much of the problems in
[SPEAKER_07]: the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's important for us to be
independent from corporations and to be
[SPEAKER_07]: independent in our food production and
build connections and community through
[SPEAKER_07]: food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a lot of what is lost in
the world now and away from this digital
[SPEAKER_07]: world and having our hands in the earth,
I think, would heal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a tiny farm, but the practices we're
putting in place, the amount of carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can pull out of the atmosphere
and put into your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this was happening at the industrial
scale, you know, it would hugely change
[SPEAKER_04]: the course we're on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I picture our farm as this tiny little
postage stamp of change and pulling in
[SPEAKER_04]: this tiny little postage stamp amount of
carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I picture what that would look
like if every little farm was doing
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always thought, like, if a person
grows a garden, it is the most pure
[SPEAKER_05]: expression of their soul that you can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some people are like,
you should write a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how do you how to book?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, no, it will be different for
every single person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how cool is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I want to see everyone's
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: What an Eden if everybody if every human
could have a couple of acres to just grow
[SPEAKER_05]: their garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Eden I'd love to see happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our farm name is Folklife Farm,
and then our cannabis brand is Radical
[SPEAKER_11]: Herbs.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's spelled R-A-D-I-C-L-E.
[SPEAKER_11]: The radical is the first root to emerge
from a seed, any seed.
[SPEAKER_11]: The greater world wants to tell you that
to be radical is to be a fringe,
[SPEAKER_11]: to be, you know, on the periphery and not
really grounded.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you look at the root of the word,
to be radical is to be grounded because
[SPEAKER_11]: the radical is the root.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the rest of the world that's
crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are grounded and you are aware of
your surroundings and you listen to your
[SPEAKER_11]: intuition, that is what the world needs
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs radical.
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs radical people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what farming has done for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Farming has kind of allowed me to be
grounded.
[SPEAKER_11]: Radical.
[SPEAKER_11]: Radical.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's what we're trying to do
right now, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to replace the current
paradigm of industrial agriculture because
[SPEAKER_11]: it's not working.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's destroying the environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're not looking to destroy anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking to replace what is currently
happening with a better system.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it means everybody has to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to eat vegetables only,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you should find it locally.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to eat meat, too, that's
great.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you should find it locally.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to be like polite and say we're
not trying to destroy anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to replace it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are looking to destroy the
industrial food model.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it needs to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And from that is going to emerge stronger
local communities.
[SPEAKER_11]: That are taking this stuff into their own
hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the last three billion years,
nature has finally tuned herself to
[SPEAKER_08]: connect soil, air and water in infinite
cycles that support all life on this
[SPEAKER_08]: planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlike the industrial model, which will
eventually destroy the earth, a
[SPEAKER_08]: regenerative system works with nature,
giving back more than it takes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are currently using 38% of the earth's
land for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we start to use regenerative practices
on a fraction of this land, we can
[SPEAKER_08]: sequester enough carbon to undo some of
the damage we've done.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we experience more extreme destruction
every year due to climate change,
[SPEAKER_08]: there is an urgent need to act now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Technology is not going to save us from
total ecological collapse.
[SPEAKER_08]: The solutions are right in front of us and
always have been.
[SPEAKER_08]: The future, as was the past, is
regenerative.
Thank you very much.
