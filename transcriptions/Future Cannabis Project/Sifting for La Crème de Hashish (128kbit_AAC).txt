[SPEAKER_00]: People think that I was going there and
sitting at the feet of the Ashishin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going there to make my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I learned because you walk
alongside with the same tool and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that than the local.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I came to India, the difference
was all my life, I work mostly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter in producing country and with
bundle of dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me to be able to get that one kilo,
one kilo and a half, two kilos that I need
[SPEAKER_00]: for my year consumption, I need to move to
do a lot of sieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the deal was, OK, I'm going to make 80
kilos, 100 kilos to get what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, everything I do, I leave behind me to
that local farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I just want that kilo or two of the
pure cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do I have to pay for staying with
you so long?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are you going to make me pay for
the two kilos of cream that I'm taking?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean by cream?
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't know what you're malai,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, cream like melt, like something so
melty, it melts in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: At room temperature, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: More like when they got to Goa,
it was melting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest quality of your sieving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you get, how does the farmer
make and get the cream?
[SPEAKER_00]: By sieving to a level, by hardly... Wait,
wait, OK, he cuts the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, so I buy a bundle, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of plants together in a drying
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that bundle in a room where I break
down everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take all the stock, everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, my first sieving, super light,
that's what I keep for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And onto what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing onto a screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all dry sieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a screen like this and you're
breaking it up and it's falling and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: catching it down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even break it, break it,
it's later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just make it vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get enough of this, I need to have a
lot of material and that material,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's stupid to do it only one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it ten times.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those grade, I'm ready to give it in
an exchange for hospitality and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't kill me on the price for what I'm
making because that normally is at their
[SPEAKER_00]: stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I take your stash but I give
you everything else and I'm ready to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a good price because you're the people
I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty sweet deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in India... No, it's a relationship
you make over time with the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not a good customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not spending much money and I stay
long with them, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to supercompensate with your
farmer to be able to get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, you literally stick live resin
on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relation with the plant doing that in
the most remote valley of the Himalayas
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time where I had that
relation with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to come here to understand genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had that strong relation for the
first time with that living organism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have it in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, month after month, it's like
it's sipping in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have all these buds,
but they have seeds in them?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what do you do with those buds
with seeds in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You caress them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all caressing, so you're super light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You waste tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long is the period that you're
rubbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The season is earlier than anything
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the jungle is like early September to
end of September, mid-September to the
[SPEAKER_00]: first week of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then up to end of November,
you have cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes even I had a season where it
fucking snow like this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two days later it had melted and we
didn't finish our field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants were all back up,
but they were like semi wild plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them, every year we didn't touch
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them go back to the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were all stand up, but they were
all burned by the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a lot of contaminant in our
hands that we couldn't separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the resin was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, torture your plants and make
them survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's survival of the species.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said gently, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to torture them gently that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You caress them because your hands are
your tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin is sticky, but if you have water in
your hands, it's not going to stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sweat, you don't stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have oily hands, you don't stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break the plant and there is water
from the plant and chlorophyll that come
[SPEAKER_00]: in your hand, it's not going to stick the
same either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's like you just caress the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you look at your hand,
it's all shiny and it's sticky like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then layer, plant by plant,
layer by layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant, you clean up any little
particles that stick to it and slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly it layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the color starts to appear and it got
from transparent to light amber,
[SPEAKER_00]: orangey, red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you have a thick enough
layer, it's dark, almost black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you have enough and you
carefully, you see that when you caress
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, there is chunk from your hand
that goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take your thumb, you turn it
on your hand and you snap it out and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the ash is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be on your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you unstick all your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still sticky, but it becomes super
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most difficult is actually to transfer
this to your other thumb so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: clean up that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is two way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you do a finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you roll in your hand that
piece of ash so you capture whatever is
[SPEAKER_00]: left in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or me, I like better, but the local didn't
have plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made like flat pancake into a thick
plastic so that there is very little air
[SPEAKER_00]: that can get in contact with the resin and
create mold and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in India, the problem is mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like even when your resin is
perfectly clean, the mold spore are
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere and they stick to the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a bunch of fingers super
clean, but they put them all together into
[SPEAKER_00]: a bigger bundle and in between you have
the mold that is coming only when you
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it to the mountain down in South
India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the temperature change and the
humidity change.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place when you're molding the
hash where at a certain point now it
[SPEAKER_03]: changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The texture changes and the color changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like live resin we got with the
ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as dry resin, ash is the same than
ice water, dry cured resin, live resin in
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand is very different than live
resin from the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it shouldn't be that different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never seen nucleation in my life and
there is 70% humidity easier than in
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could see why Frenchy,
you wanted to make your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for them, they can either make
like 20 grams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can either make like 20 grams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they can make five grams of creme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then to get them to make creme is very
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need them next to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you tell them, okay, you work like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of making 20 grams at so much
money, you're gonna make only five,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you as much money for what all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I went there with a Brahmin that
was pretty amazing in Malana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it changed the perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deal was a guy said, everything
you make, I put ash that I buy of high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the season, we go
together to New Delhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sell it to foreigners the same way
that I would sell it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's your payment for what you're
giving me, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have the local people also that
come and do the field around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know that you're ready to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they literally work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every night they bring you their
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show you their hand during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's a kind of sad situation in
the mountains right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because before the farmers used to go
there and they had this word called cod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cod used to mean goat shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you go to the mountains and ask
them what cod is, they pull out this
[SPEAKER_01]: little pink bag of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been completely destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the demand for hash is so high,
especially with India's economic boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody smokes hash in the cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have these farmers pushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're growing with salts and ruining
all of those hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need worldwide legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like the first people that started to
change everything, if you bring foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic to a place where the genetic is
possibly 670,000 years old, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're polluting a pool that, technically
speaking, is a national treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Indians, they want, actually,
they ask for the, I had some huge argument
[SPEAKER_00]: on forum, the guy wanted genetic from here
to bring to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was telling him, it's like you have
a vast source of amazing and unique
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to bring something foreign
that is based, an hybridation of actually
[SPEAKER_00]: land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to bring that there and
pollute something that is unique to your
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, you don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they see the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, they want to do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to smoke the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Indian government is now
actually trying to do a land race catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're about to start doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things is for that whole
thing with the genetic markers,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they want to make sure that they get
land races that are still existing,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just in Himalaya, but in Orissa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, not Tamil Nadu, but Andhra
Pradesh is also a traditional cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: growing areas, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but they're still hung up on the
0.3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're still, they're only going to
stake stuff that's 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they sort of don't get it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: About full plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it's the highest level of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like from the old ash I was smoking
when I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a scientist in Israel that did a
study on 10 years of bust in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese and Indian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from the 1990 to the 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not too far from my time to be a
huge difference between what I was smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: in France and those busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese is basically a one-on-one CBD
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a pretty low level of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were seeing only, looking only at
THC, CBD and CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 4% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're telling me that the fucking red
Lebanese that I remember 45 years later
[SPEAKER_00]: was only 4% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's cracking me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moroccan is- Was it really getting you
stoned in those old days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 to 1 is a Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher percentage of THC than CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in India, it's basically 5 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot more THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the mountains, the Charras is
like 14% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14?
[SPEAKER_00]: 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like- Even if it's not the
greatest of the greatest, it shows very
[SPEAKER_00]: much how much the entourage effect
actually gives power to the ash we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is no way I was smoking a
one-on-one 4% THC and still be raving
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many years later, I dream to smoke a
red Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there is no way that if it
didn't have that specific terpene profile
[SPEAKER_00]: that is so unique, you cannot even
describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy, we made the Willys Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we made the Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Willys, Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we only made like 3, 4 grams of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super nice high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think there was much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more THC than I sold, but a lot of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a CBD high, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is on a certain level.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use Western words?
[SPEAKER_03]: Psychiatry?
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I made ash 52% CBD, but I never tried them
until Milan a month ago when I was a judge
[SPEAKER_00]: for the ash made from high CBD,
almost 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I smoked four spliffs in
a week, four in a row in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean of high CBD ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, four in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, four in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is science.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your dedication here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, with tobacco and CBD,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash, it was pure ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wake up in the morning, I have a
bunch of aches and pain and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never felt such a well-being-ness,
a body release, but it's like a curtain
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes slowly, slowly down your body
and it's well-being-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a buzz, but it's a buzz of
feeling so good in your body, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a buzz per se, but it's like on
the body it's got an amazing... Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's your cannabinoid system, your
endocannabinoid system that the CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow comes in and like dances with and
it's just a sort of... It's super
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...
