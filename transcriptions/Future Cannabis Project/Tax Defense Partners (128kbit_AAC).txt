[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Patrick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to welcome everybody here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Lisa and her staff for
allowing us the opportunity to educate,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully educate, everybody here in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you will know what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't, hopefully we can
impart some education on you so as to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to navigate the treacherous
waters of the IRS and the state taxing
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to first turn this over to my
supervising attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is Elizabeth Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elizabeth has 20 years, goes back about 20
years with experience in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let her discuss what the
topics are that everybody is facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many levels of issues in the
cannabis business when it comes to taxing
[SPEAKER_00]: that obviously we're not going to be able
to cover all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards, after the Q&A, if you have any
additional questions, don't hesitate to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up to either one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be happy to answer your questions to
the best of our ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can't answer them, we'll find
somebody here that can answer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to turn it over to Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Pat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people feel like they should
be paying the right amount of tax in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many feel like the IRS actually
charges you the right amount of tax?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why proposition or code section 280E?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has heard of 280E?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than I thought, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the hint is the IRS is saying
we're going to tax you on all your income
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to give you almost no
deduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that seems fair, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That all works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been especially a problem in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been the first ones through the
door with legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't any guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't any rules they could follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were trying to claim all their
business expenses like normal businesses
[SPEAKER_02]: would, ordinary necessary business
expenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: IRS came back, audited them all,
and gave them nice big tax bills,
[SPEAKER_02]: disallowing most of their expenses under
280E.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been a very difficult row in the
cannabis industry to file a solid tax
[SPEAKER_02]: return and try and insulate yourself
against audit, follow all the rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: and still make the most profit that you
can legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that's difficult as a
representative and as a preparer really
[SPEAKER_02]: starts with you guys when it comes to
bookkeeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first and foremost, if you hear nothing
that I have to say tonight, I want you to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear you need to be good with your
bookkeeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get QuickBooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your receipts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are paying everything in cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not you don't have canceled
checks to show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably don't have credit card
receipts to show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really falls to you guys to make sure
that you create as strong a wall as you
[SPEAKER_02]: can for the expenses that are out there
and with the money that you're putting
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The IRS will push and they'll poke and
they'll look for holes to try to raise
[SPEAKER_02]: your tax liability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first line of defense starts with
your business practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't have a bookkeeper or
you're not good at bookkeeping,
[SPEAKER_02]: find one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get QuickBooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a scanner for your receipts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be ready to go because really that's your
first best shot at moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to preparing the taxes,
there are a lot of people I've noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: after going to the conference last week
who are representing themselves as experts
[SPEAKER_02]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've heard of 280E so they must know
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take it at face value.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a lot of misinformation coming
through on that conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that person's been in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really vet them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them explain back to you what 280E is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them explain back to you what sort of
expenses they can and cannot take.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it sounds too good to be true,
it's too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you want to walk away with
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question I get asked quite a bit
is why should I even file?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a cash and carry business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you chances are at some point
they will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you don't file, you really open
the door for the IRS to come in and say
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't file this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go ahead and do that for
you and now you owe us a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the impetus is back on you to say
no, no, no, I don't owe you all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I owe you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had expenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're on the defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've got to prove their numbers
wrong and show your documentation and hope
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have a good representative,
you get in there and get some relief,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you've really relinquished the wheel
to the IRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones who are going to come in
and tell you how much you owe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You file a tax return, you're the one
driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them prove you wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them come forward and audit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we know the cannabis industry is
getting hit pretty hard in the audit
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Numbers anywhere from 12% to 20% of people
filing in the cannabis industry are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get audited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these good practices will get you in a
position where you're going to be less
[SPEAKER_02]: exposed than other people who aren't
following some pretty basic things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't file, you really do open
the door to the IRS to go ahead and do
[SPEAKER_02]: that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, once they start looking,
you don't file for one year, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: file for two years, now they're looking at
a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're looking at returns you maybe
did file before you were in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're really crawling up your tax
life with a microscope looking for money
[SPEAKER_02]: they can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are some very important things
when it comes to the decision whether or
[SPEAKER_02]: not to file.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step the IRS can take is criminal
investigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people in the cannabis industry,
federal government looking in on a
[SPEAKER_02]: criminal level doesn't sound good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sounds like a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can take those steps,
get some good bookkeeping behind you,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a good preparer, file your returns,
you are really in a much stronger position
[SPEAKER_02]: than if you just duck under the covers and
hope they don't find you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually they will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's some of the big questions I have
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about something a little
different that you need to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: the questions you need to be asking your
practitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will all need CPAs, you will all need
tax attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't emphasize enough what Elizabeth
said about people holding themselves up as
[SPEAKER_00]: experts in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be catastrophic for you as a
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the right attorneys,
if you don't have the right tax
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioner, you're going to open
yourself up to brutal penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The penalties can be as high as almost
50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will wipe you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to talk about though is you
don't need to be afraid of the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not need to be afraid of your state
taxation organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Elizabeth said, if you keep
meticulous books, just do what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioner tells you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set up a lot of clients with a
bookkeeping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, you're almost at a point
where you welcome the audit because the
[SPEAKER_00]: government is not going to bother you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to audit you and they're
going to see how meticulous you are and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, with regard to some people are
going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when you do, it could be simply a
bookkeeping mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be you missed filing anything
from a 1099 to a W-2, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people are going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to preface the second part of this
by explaining and your practitioners
[SPEAKER_00]: should know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IRS is a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IRS gets their funding from the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal government gives X amount of
dollars to the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IRS has a numerous amount of
divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got offering compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a whole bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those divisions has a
supervisor and they're all allocated money
[SPEAKER_00]: from the pot, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like any good business, they get audited
themselves and they need to be making a
[SPEAKER_00]: profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any other business or they go
out of business or supervisors,
[SPEAKER_00]: head roles, whatever it is, just like any
other business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government, there's an organization
called the Taxpayer Advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a wonderful source of tax
information for those that don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: prom or just want to get some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of a watchdog, in essence,
too, for the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they'll do, for example, is a recent
study that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found out that three out of five
revenue officers will give three different
[SPEAKER_00]: answers to the same exact question.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are treacherous waters sometimes
with the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they did a recent study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government is making, the IRS is
making $7 on every dollar they invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: going after you as a taxpayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hell of a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any business out there would be happy as
hell with three or four to one on their
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean to you as a
practitioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: 280 is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of goods not being allowed,
it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few write-offs,
but if you do get audited as a
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioner, this is the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start cutting into their profit,
you're going to have a lot more power in
[SPEAKER_00]: negotiating a settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is, if you get
audited, this is a generalistic approach
[SPEAKER_00]: to when you get audited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says they're disallowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be any kind of expense whatsoever
you can think of, entertaining,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go through the audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you audit, and I strongly recommend
you have somebody do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they have the credentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the right to know how many or
close to clients your practitioner is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually handled in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get audited, what's going to happen
is you go through the audit, they come
[SPEAKER_00]: back with what's called a 45-49.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, Elizabeth, you owe us
$100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if a practitioner has been involved
in the industry, they'll know that since
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a business, you want to make it
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I want to emphasize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not worry about fighting the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to end up on some no-fly
list because you fought the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have too many people to go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most recent calculation is
somewhere around $450 billion,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it, that the government is trying to
collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the size of the revenue of an entire
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is after that audit,
the original assessment, you want to fight
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when it starts getting really
interesting to the IRS because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the whole audit all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to an appeals officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to do the whole thing all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think that means?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cutting into the profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's work that the IRS has to do all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, our experience has been that
the appeals officer with no additional
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation at all, because it's a
substantiation case essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent this much, you're saying I don't
get credit for that, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: with no additional information,
our experience has been that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% knocked off just simply because you
took it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do is what we do for our clients
and what other practitioners do for their
[SPEAKER_00]: clients that have been doing this for a
while, is they'll file a tax court
[SPEAKER_00]: petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes to a bunch of lawyers at the
IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The district counsel division is attorneys
that handle tax court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get lawyers involved,
you're seriously cutting in to the profit
[SPEAKER_00]: margin of the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically on substantiation cases,
you now have $100,000 debt has been
[SPEAKER_00]: knocked down to say $80,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The attorneys typically will be,
first of all, they're overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't figure this one out, but the
government, their number one revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: producer, they've cut their budget every
year for I think three straight years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes the revenue officers very
cranky because they have much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: caseloads than they've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't figured that one out,
why they're doing it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to tax court, because they're
so overwhelmed, what happens is these are
[SPEAKER_00]: substantiation cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The district counsel, for the most part,
is not interested in substantiation cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be more interested if Elizabeth had
a tax shelter in Bolivia or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's typically a lot of money involved,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll typically go back to the appeals
officer and say, we don't want to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want nothing to do with Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had, at times, over 50% of the
original assessment wiped out simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because they want to settle, because there
are millions of taxpayers out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: are willing to fall on their sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're terrified of the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the IRS comes back with an assessment,
they figure they're screwed and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing they can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is without a single additional piece
of evidence that says, we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: justify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'd love to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of attorneys and CPAs and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a bit of a game to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have, like Elizabeth said,
you must have practitioners who know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing for you to take advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to suggest that you strongly
fight each and every situation you get
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get rid of the entire amount
that's owed and you have to get set up on
[SPEAKER_00]: a payment plan, people typically try to do
it on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize that there are things
like the IRS code and the IRS manual
[SPEAKER_00]: individually are thicker than the Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize, as laypeople,
that there are statutes in the code and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rules that say that if Elizabeth
ran into a problem, say physical,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only about eight of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them reasonable cause arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can have all her penalties abated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical person doesn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to have is someone who knows
that law, because if she's entitled to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of penalties, if she doesn't,
you're looking at, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes as high as 50% on your
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing is, you might say to
yourself, and I'm kind of happy the IRS
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't do this, the IRS, for the most
part, knows their own rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been a lot of controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys have probably seen it on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, revenue officers,
their careers are contingent upon how much
[SPEAKER_00]: money they bring in and how quickly they
bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think they're going to tell you,
Elizabeth, that you don't have to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties because you went through a
divorce or you became very ill and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what led to the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to leave you with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure, and we can't emphasize this
enough, it really, you know, the IRS is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of organizations like ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they just followed their own rules and
their own regulations, I probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be standing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're the ones that say,
no, you've got to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to leave you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please fight them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please get representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not the only game in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a crossover industry, like Lisa
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing taxes, getting people out
of trouble, setting them up on payment
[SPEAKER_00]: plans, whatever, for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just implore you to do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are entitled to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your financial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not need to be afraid of the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I'm a cannabis business,
we all know that we have a hard time
[SPEAKER_04]: getting banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the money I might take in is
going to be in the form of cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I need to be aware of when it
comes to the IRS when I'm taking those
[SPEAKER_04]: cash payments?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you want to be aware of form 8300,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have $10,000, $1 cash that
you're depositing, that you're moving,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an IRS report, 8300, that you're
going to fill out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to find your social
security number.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want to know the source
of the income.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a trigger number, not $10,000,
$10,001.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to start to require these
returns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are going to be reviewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might take them a year to get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't do anything very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're very diligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't stop them either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually they'll start looking into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure that you have
your documentation to support the source
[SPEAKER_02]: of those funds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if I have them come in and pay $5,000
on Tuesday and $5,001 on Thursday?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's going to be an aggregate
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't stack them up like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to start looking for
patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to start finding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to hide that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to add to that,
I actually know a banker with a huge bank
[SPEAKER_00]: here in California that they're literally
smelling the money when it comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's less than 10, you've got an
8300 requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're so paranoid about it's illegal
to schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're FDIC insured.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be audited themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gone at times and reported there's
an organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be 57 in a couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called Sinfin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the financial Sinfin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinfin is the criminal division.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that money gets reported to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not filing it, if you're not
filling out that form and they catch up to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you're in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me add one more thing about banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banking is critically important in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in California, we're not looking at
banks that want to embrace us at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some of the other states where they've
decriminalized, especially Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are some banks that are coming up
and they're willing to deal with these on
[SPEAKER_02]: a limited basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five, six banks that I know of that are
actually being proactive and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between Colorado and
California right now is the lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation as far as the banking is
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we expect to see some regulation in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the beginning of 2018, and at that
point, we really do expect banks locally
[SPEAKER_02]: to start looking to this industry because
they not only smell the money,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can smell the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want your business, but they want to
make sure that they stay clean along the
[SPEAKER_02]: process and not get criminally
investigated for laundering money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So help is coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, next question real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under 280E, having a collective
cooperative, cost of goods, better to be
[SPEAKER_03]: on consignment?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty specific question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to look at those to be a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to see how that's set up to be able
to intelligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a lawyer, so I'm going to hedge that
and say it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty specific scenario,
so that's something we should not have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under consignment, the cost of goods is
actually a little bit different being a
[SPEAKER_03]: collective or cooperative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have a member base situation
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can write off just the profit or
that sale and pay it back to the member.
[SPEAKER_03]: From my understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say something about 280E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, because we stay up as much as
we can on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that's why we do the business
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries, you have budtenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got cash register people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can argue if you're doing a medical
consultation
[SPEAKER_00]: you can argue that that consultation
between you and I is a consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can try to write off part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you walk over to the cash
register, you better not try to write it
[SPEAKER_00]: off because you're dealing drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are hand to hand transaction of a
class scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another reason why you need to
know about the person who's handling your
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give you, use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that little example and see what your
practitioner says.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're looking at you like,
oh no, everything's a write off or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, they don't know what the hell
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing I wanted to bring out,
this industry is becoming regulated in
[SPEAKER_00]: essence by the tax court.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff out there that's
going to come down that hopefully is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to change the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exciting to see what next year
looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what if, okay, I have two questions,
two quick questions actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, say your company is just CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that affect the banking in
California?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still going to be, you're still going
to be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not title, it's not the... No,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still handling the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is still going to be the class one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still going to be looking at the
same roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, mine's more, I'm a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a lot of manufacturing cost of
packaging and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do with that because of the
280E?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I... Actually, manufacturing is so
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growers, manufacturers have a lot more
they can include under cost of goods sold
[SPEAKER_02]: than the dispensary owners you're going to
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you taking new clients?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to the convention and I had the
same question there that I have here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is with the banking problem,
with this industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you go to bank?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I mean, the best answer I got,
again, from that conference from somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: I very much respect was basically,
I mean, there are some agencies that will
[SPEAKER_02]: help you find banks perhaps outside of
California, certainly still in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, just to be clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some industries, there are
some people in this industry who will help
[SPEAKER_02]: you find banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as walking into somewhere in
California to open a bank account,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then what would you suggest people
do since they can't get a bank in
[SPEAKER_07]: California, they go where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of a tricky question for
us to kind of imply like you should do
[SPEAKER_00]: something maybe you shouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good thing for us to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lawyers and CPAs who have
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guarantee you this, there is
somebody in this room that is using a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular bank, some banks will charge
you a huge fee in order to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bank in Massachusetts charging like
$5,000 a month to service your account
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're hiring compliance officers
to make sure you're not Manuel Noriega.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just dated myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, who's the most recent drug dealer
that got busted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pablo Escobar?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, still dating myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Chapo, El Chapo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that was the whole point of 280E.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to remember the intention much
like the Bank Secrecy Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank Secrecy Act is something I'd like to
touch on in a second real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember it was intended to ferret out
criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IRS still looks at us as criminals,
in essence, because it's still a schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no idea what's going to happen
with the two candidates, either one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hillary has been against it from way back
when.
[SPEAKER_00]: She softened her stance because guess
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are out there lobbying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are proving that this is an
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are proving that this is safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado has shown a reduction in serious
crimes since cannabis became legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the evidence is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I'm sorry, you guys through
all the networking, women grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: are making a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So candidates need to sit up and take
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question and a comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Dodd-Frank Act, which is the
follow the cash, is really it's 8,300 is
[SPEAKER_05]: in for the entire year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not per transaction, which I learned
by error because I was in the diamond
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I have a deposit from the same
client and it was 5,000, 8,000,
[SPEAKER_05]: regardless, it's 10,000 for the year from
vendor one, which I don't think you were
[SPEAKER_05]: clear on that for the 8,300.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can do 9,900 multiple times,
but it's per client, per annual year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that wasn't clarified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the, you know, this is deep
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of intricacies that
afterwards we can discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax managers and whatnot will look at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll specifically look right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, did you have a $5,500 cash deposit
last week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, it's a $3,300 cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to, you're absolutely
correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing you didn't mention is I was
a compliance officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was unfortunately or fortunately,
I'm not sure yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do suggest if you guys don't have
compliance officers in your business,
[SPEAKER_05]: put one person in charge of compliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes your life a lot easier to follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: One person is responsible for Dodd-Frank.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other thing, which was actually a
question, I have banking relationships
[SPEAKER_05]: with a small bank and I've been very
fortunate and I've heard many people in
[SPEAKER_05]: different parts of California working with
a small bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I was just told that a,
well, they're not savings alone anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're credit unions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm dating myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So credit unions, thoughts versus a bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting you bring up credit
unions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, I don't want to call it scuttle,
but that California is going to create
[SPEAKER_00]: their own credit unions for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 2018 we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the interim, you have to comply with
the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're opening yourself up to a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And huge, huge what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we had emphasized that you must
get people to know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa will tell you from city to city,
county to county, the rules are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got cities that like to flex their
muscles and say, no, I'm not going to let
[SPEAKER_00]: that many dispensaries in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you need to know those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of money to start a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of money to get invested in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to also say I heard someone
talking at the Washington convention and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were on a panel and I thought it was
a little irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hammering away at how much money
it costs to get into this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the distinct feeling it was
about them wanting to limit the
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great industry to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very profitable industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share a little story with you about
Kraft Foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry has got the attention of
corporate America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kraft Foods, from what I've been told,
has established a separate marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: division to deal with edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they know it's going to become
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got the best distribution than Kraft
Foods and the credibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Kraft is coming to you to buy your
edibles company in two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick Cox, Elizabeth Sheldon from Tax
Defense Partners.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
