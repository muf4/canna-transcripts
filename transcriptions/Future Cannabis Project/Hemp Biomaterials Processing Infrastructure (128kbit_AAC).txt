[SPEAKER_01]: It's been challenging, first and foremost,
in the lack of infrastructure and
[SPEAKER_01]: processing here in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is just kind of coming out of
its shell, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to process the organic waste into a
useful, reusable, sustainable material
[SPEAKER_01]: within a reasonable distance has been a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually breaking ground on one
of the first biorefinery in the state at
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully the end of this year to create
these regional circular economies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The infrastructure's not really there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you travel more than 100 miles with
it could be the most sustainable material
[SPEAKER_01]: on Earth, it immediately degrades that
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think restock was a little bit ahead
of its time in the sense that the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't producing as much material and the
infrastructure wasn't really in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily now the demand is there and
certainly the industry is growing there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now the last piece of the puzzle is
the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In place to process all these different
inputs, we're primarily focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by infrastructure you just mean the
processing, like the biorefinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, processing with a different,
with more than one end result,
[SPEAKER_01]: more than one application, whether it's
textiles, whether it is paper-based
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, whether it is bioplastics,
whether that is some kind of alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of different ways to do it
and people who are much smarter than me
[SPEAKER_01]: are thankfully in charge of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just really fortunate to have some
partners in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who have been the most helpful allies for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: The state has been very encouraging,
I will say that, despite we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier about just the back and forth
between regulators and the bureaucracy,
[SPEAKER_01]: red tape surrounding that has been wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CalRecycle, the governor's office have
been very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, like I was saying earlier,
they have their plates really full with
[SPEAKER_01]: how much they should be taxing,
giving out all these licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: how are they going to deal with the influx
of money and cash, all these businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times waste management and
recycling is the basement level of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been very helpful and partners
like Circular Systems, which are the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing partners that we're building
this biorefinery with, have been
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're focusing on textiles?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're focusing on textiles, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're developing a couple cool projects
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just awarded the H&M Global
Agents of Change Award for 2018,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like the Nobel Peace Prize for
fashion, which was a very big deal for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came with some money too?
[SPEAKER_01]: It came with, yeah, some money as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were voted Time Magazine's top 10
smartest sustainable ideas of 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're honored to be working so closely
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think innovation should be driving
regulation, and that's a very slippery
[SPEAKER_01]: slope, especially given the way that the
exchange of information is so fast
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to stay ahead of
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think California is doing a great
job, and they're doing what they can to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the technology is here, and it's
honestly a race against time.
