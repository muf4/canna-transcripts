[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, hey Tina, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you good?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I got a good enough connection
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the park in Medford here I think
it's a yeah, I can hear you just fine
[SPEAKER_00]: great great Happy season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you've been super busy on
your farm Yes, indeed definitely have
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we We just got a bunch of hemp in
the ground about five acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been really really busy time of
year We've been working on the drip line
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get that in Fortunately,
we're blessed with some rain some
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected rain so that that was really a
blessing and really a savior really
[SPEAKER_00]: because We're a little bit behind on
getting our drip lines in You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is some of the bigger acreage farms
that I've worked on so it's Things that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a small task on a smaller farm
become a giant task, you know when you
[SPEAKER_01]: scale it up Yes, yeah, so it's new to you
to do this acreage and it's also new to
[SPEAKER_01]: you to scale up on Definitely yeah,
and so that's that's what I wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about today was really the last two years
of my Trials with KNF and JDOM more,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know on a larger scale working with
commercial cannabis and hemp farms
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Because everyone I think that's like
it that's a very Prevalent question is how
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great and all but how do you scale
up?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you scale up and?
[SPEAKER_01]: right system Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very I've learned that it's a
very systematic approach, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't make sense to Kick dandelions
on your your lawn if you have you know
[SPEAKER_00]: several acres to work on so So really for
me it's come down to only a few herbs that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with on You know five acres of
hemp you know, because I'm very sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: also to The wild crafting techniques we
use being sustainable With our wild
[SPEAKER_00]: crafting practices, you know having a
reverence for for the wild places to truly
[SPEAKER_00]: be regenerative we need to be sustainable
and careful about the way that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching nature and and in harvesting
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, definitely We're gonna talk
about that and maybe as an intro to people
[SPEAKER_01]: who may not know about you I'm fascinated
and feel sort of in alignment with you
[SPEAKER_01]: that you just got a host of different
kinds of Trainings and knowledge going for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an herbalist you practice alchemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are permaculture is correct and Then
you add Korean natural farming to the to
[SPEAKER_01]: the mix So can you just go briefly into a
little bit of your history and what
[SPEAKER_01]: brought you?
[SPEAKER_01]: to this place Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, uh You know in the past life,
I guess you could say I was an
[SPEAKER_00]: architectural draftsman working at a desk
job and did that for over a decade and in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009 the economy collapsed I found myself
out of work and Kind of wondering well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of had the American dream owned a
house on a nice car all the things kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: did what I thought it was supposed to do
and it collapsed and so That set me on a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new kind of course in life I was
living in Salt Lake City, Utah at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: so I bought a sleeping bag and tent with
my last paycheck and kind of was hiking
[SPEAKER_00]: around through the foothills and Camping
and learned about you know nettle and and
[SPEAKER_00]: nettles and Elderberries and found that I
could sustain off of these plants alone
[SPEAKER_00]: and from there You know I'll just shorten
this story, but I ended up in Japan I had
[SPEAKER_00]: a Japanese girlfriend at the time so I
moved to Japan and the first day I got
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a day that the tsunami happened
Yeah, that was my entrance into living in
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan and dealing with natural disaster
and a lot of Instability in city life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what it really did for me was
catalyze Thinking about like living more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably and how in society maybe we're
not doing the best job of that so From
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan when I went back to the states I had
an opportunity to move to Humboldt County
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister had been living there for like
20 years Her and her partner and so I went
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Humboldt County from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity to work on many
cannabis farms and Medical cannabis farms
[SPEAKER_00]: living off the grid a year of that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent living in a tent in the Lost Coast
really isolated from a lot of civilization
[SPEAKER_00]: and people and just kind of got to spend
time you know communing with the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: and learning about the plants and Then I
got into some so really that's what drove
[SPEAKER_00]: me into, you know permaculture ideals
which led me into finding about Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming and So yeah, I owe a lot
to to Humboldt County for for taking me in
[SPEAKER_00]: and it really teaching me sustainability
and in regenerative Farming and and so
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of offered work in Southern
Oregon for some bigger farms doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercially, I was offered a gig a couple
years ago With a company to come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: show them how to do Korean natural farming
on a large scale, which was very
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive to me because I had done it on
Smaller scales even indoors and seen a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of really great results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was this was an opportunity for
me to To scale this up and and show that
[SPEAKER_00]: it that it worked on a large scale which I
did and Really, you know Ever since I
[SPEAKER_00]: found KNF I've never gone back to right
other styles of farming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, and so you were were you able
to find results from that first year of
[SPEAKER_01]: scaling up like right away that first year
was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so the farm that I got to in Oregon it
was a two tier two grows so it was about
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about two and a half acres of
cannabis and When I got there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a lot of clay soil in
Southern Oregon a lot of volcanic pumice
[SPEAKER_00]: and clay and When I got there the soil was
horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was I wouldn't even call it soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really it was It was clay it looked like
the desert, you know cracks in the desert
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly, you know very hydrophobic
no life in the no life in the soil no
[SPEAKER_00]: worms no Nothing no topsoil really and so
the first thing I did was I came in and I
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a heavy mulch and I did a very heavy
application of JMS to dawn microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: solution Alternated that with lactic acid
bacteria and over the course of three
[SPEAKER_00]: months the wintertime the wet months
Totally transformed the soil there from
[SPEAKER_00]: being hard clay hydrophobic holding no
water to really beautiful Soil that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know was holding water that had life in it
that had worms So what was the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: that application?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you so the mulch Larry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you was it like how deep did you go on
that that first year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not too terribly deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just did a straw layer and you know
only only about Half inch of straw I'd say
[SPEAKER_00]: across the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, and we were blessed with a lot
of rains and So basically I would
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do JMS to dawn microbial solution
the next week I would do lactic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and Between the foliar foliars,
uh Well, yeah, I mean I was I was
[SPEAKER_01]: drenching not foliars drenching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all right yeah, so I was soil
drenching and And yeah, it was amazing to
[SPEAKER_00]: me to see how just in three months you
could really transform Clay hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know cracked hydrophobic soil into
really beautiful Living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so we saw a huge transformation
in You know the the the health of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants It was really really amazing Very
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that kind of so then how did
you get into your situation now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can launch into what your Wanting
to share great great now Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so so I'm primarily working with hemp now,
but I also grow You know, I'm an herbalist
[SPEAKER_00]: and I and I grow a lot of perennial herbs
annual herbs and work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different herbs so I have a passion for
growing herbs and veggies as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but primarily I'm I'm working full-time on
on two hemp farms at the moment and
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting on some other hemp farms up and
bend and around Oregon So Stepping back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the story where I came out to Oregon to
work for this company I at one point the
[SPEAKER_00]: company got absorbed by a larger company
and I had some ethical dilemmas with with
[SPEAKER_00]: that and teaching Korean natural farming
to These big scale companies so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left that company and now I'm working
with some smaller my partners on some
[SPEAKER_00]: small You know hemp projects so hemp hemp
is primarily my focus and that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using the JDOM KNF Practices on really
right now Yeah So are you finding that the
[SPEAKER_01]: apps like scaling up has okay,
how do I ask this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like is the sweet spot of
application?
[SPEAKER_01]: applied large scales seem to be and is
there is there a range between like three
[SPEAKER_01]: to five acres or You know, does it where
does it change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does the scale up seem to shift
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not so sustainable to ideal is have
your sweet spot Yeah, that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say yeah once you get into
Above a couple of acres, you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing five to ten acres things
really start to change so You know for me
[SPEAKER_00]: I could I can make inputs for the most
part to be able to cover that but what
[SPEAKER_00]: gets tricky is is finding say like You
know herbs plants to do fermented plant
[SPEAKER_00]: juices doing like a totally traditional
style Korean natural farming approach You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, so I would say yeah above that two
acreage Once you get up into like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know five to ten and above that things
really start to change And it's like so
[SPEAKER_00]: where do you find enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know plant tops To make FPJs for that
kind of scale And so for me, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: narrowed down to really only a few Herbs
that I'll work with and and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that I really use these days I
was really inspired by a workshop I went
[SPEAKER_00]: to with Master Cho and young son Cho Jadam
out in Williams, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came last year and so this idea of
growing your own fertilizer like taking
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a part of your crop and So thinking
ahead of time and thinking like okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually growing a percentage of my
crop for fertilizer So that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that really I took to heart last year and
I was so inspired by that idea that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, we had four greenhouses that were a
hundred by thirty full of hemp and I
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced my partners it wasn't easy,
but I convinced them to chop down a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse because we could we had time to
replant and we used all that biomass to
[SPEAKER_00]: make FPJ fermented plant juices and Jadam
liquid fertilizers from one quarter of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp that we were growing Wow Yeah,
so I was really inspired by that and so
[SPEAKER_00]: the theory there being that you know if we
look at nutrient cycling in nature and how
[SPEAKER_00]: you know leaves are defoliating dropping
their leaves and creating a mulch layer
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is creating a protective zone for
all these indigenous microorganisms to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive and start breaking that down and
then Nutrient cycling that back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using that plant because it is in
turn the best analog for that plant and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had a moment where I was sitting with with
Master Cho and We were on a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just call it a tomato farm So I'm
sitting with Master Cho and I asked him,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they were growing some dynamic
accumulators such as comfrey and some
[SPEAKER_00]: other herbs and I I asked him I said so
Master Cho Would you in this situation
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you harvest this comfrey this great
dynamic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Accumulator to make fertilizer out of or
would you use the plant being grown here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said oh always use the plant You're
growing if possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the ratios are there Yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a perfect analog for itself You
know, yeah, so I really took that to heart
[SPEAKER_00]: and so now I put a lot of thought ahead of
time as as far as like trying to grow my
[SPEAKER_00]: own fertilizer So before we even have to
go out into nature to wildcraft we can be
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about okay I can grow a certain
percentage of my own fertilizers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, so you so you said you thought
we're able to harvest that in time for a
[SPEAKER_01]: second heart for a second planting was
there a ton so you must so they must have
[SPEAKER_01]: been fairly young plants and then did you
take the whole plant or did you just take
[SPEAKER_01]: the tips for the for the Fermented plant
you said then use the rest as a jail Is
[SPEAKER_01]: how did you what was the process for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we did both actually the plants
did get to be about oh, you know about
[SPEAKER_00]: three feet tall so we we planted pretty
early in the season and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we still had enough time that we could Put
in some plants some starts we had and
[SPEAKER_00]: still get a good yield off that second
round Yeah, so we we harvested that one
[SPEAKER_00]: full greenhouse of hemp I did go in and I
made Fermented plant juices with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth tips and then I took the rest of it
including the roots the whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: chopped it all down into IBC totes And
made a liquid fertilizer jadam liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer out of the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of that hemp was wasted
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used all Of it the roots everything
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then we able to apply that JLF
same season or is that something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would carry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like would you carry that into the second
season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found you know working with different
plants making Jadam liquid fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know certain plants will break down
faster Yeah, so, you know hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis takes a bit more time I did end
up using some of it towards towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end and This year we're using some of that
fertilizer from last year, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave it I gave it about You know five
weeks to really break down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: started using that so You know different
herbs though will break down much quicker
[SPEAKER_00]: in a Jadam liquid fertilizer plants like
this for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well per slain here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, her slain Yeah, so per slain is
an all-star This is one of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended herbs that master Cho talks
about for making fermented plant juices
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a dynamic accumulator and it also has
Also has alkaloids that enhance the color
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavor of of your crop so the cool
thing about Her slain is when you do a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid fertilizer with her slain it will
break down in liquid in ten days so That's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty awesome Like you have this will
fully liquefy and turn into a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment in ten days time when you put that
in water With you know a handful of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: mold and inoculant in there some IMO You
can break that down into a really great
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer Another one I'd like to mention
So these are some of the herbs that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: using on a large scale because they're
abundant and they're very nutrient dense
[SPEAKER_00]: So another one in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to mention is skunk cabbage and I
found a ton of skunk cabbage here in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain areas and it also it has has some
great terpenes in it and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so really what we're looking for as you
all know Tina is like we're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: like those plants that That are like
vigorous growers that kind of dominate the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape Those are generally what we look
for when we're making FPJs and so to me
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk cabbages is a perfect example of an
FPJ plant because it's just huge vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: large plant and so it's it's basically
showing us that it is packed full of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth hormones So that's really what
we're looking for when we're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: the FPJs and Like the purslane in a liquid
ferment that skunk cabbage will break down
[SPEAKER_00]: In less than two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely liquefied completely
micronized ready to use Beautiful Okay
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using in ratio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how are you using the JLF?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gets into How I'm
intermixing JDOM and Korean nacho farming
[SPEAKER_00]: because for me, I found it really hard to
make enough FPJs to really do kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional approach to Korean nacho
farming So what I'm doing is I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: alternating in JDOM liquid fertilizers in
place of Fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still use fermented plant juices,
but I'm also Alternating in the the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and so, you know and in JDOM
they kind of give a broad spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: application for The liquid fertilizers
like I was reading this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know anywhere from 20 to 300 dilution
ratio For like purslane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've been doing is I usually do
about one to a hundred So I'll do that in
[SPEAKER_00]: place of a fermented Plant juice if I
don't have a fermented plant juice on hand
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using it in concert with the OHNs
and all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using it strictly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay Yeah Yeah, so I have also done
just strictly JLF applications as well But
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah lately I've been subbing it in for
FPJs when I don't have FPJ on hand so a
[SPEAKER_00]: few advantages to of the the liquid
fertilizers is that you know, well first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all, you don't have to buy a bunch of
sugar and Secondly, you know, you can you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you don't have to just use the
growth tips, you know, like we do in
[SPEAKER_00]: Fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really use a whole plant I will
actually do different blends for different
[SPEAKER_00]: Stages of the plant growth so I have like
a flowering blend that I'll use and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that one I I'll just tell you what I use
what's showing up for me here in southern,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon So I'll do a JDOM liquid fertilizer
and this is What I would do for say a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering ferment here So wild carrot
Queen Anne's Lace this is in flower right
[SPEAKER_00]: now Really has some nice volatile
compounds going on Also Teasel Teasel
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up everywhere really vigorous grower
been using a lot of Teasel in my liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: ferments Chicory chicory was brought here
from Europe As a cattle feed, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great dynamic accumulator high in a
lot of elements and minerals Really love
[SPEAKER_00]: to to use chicory in in liquid ferments as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see Yeah, so that's generally
what what kind of shows up in and around
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm that I'm sourcing that's that's
abundant, you know, so I'm not going out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know taking Say I have like a hedge of
nettle and in the corner of my my farm I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going there and totally, you know
desecrating That whole stand so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna grow back next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking for Well, I should
mention blackberry too, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry is is one of the invasives that
really shows up In the Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_00]: and in many other places There's no
shortage of it and it's it's packed full
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth hormones enzymes all that good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Let's see Are you harvesting it through
its cycle like getting its that's its new
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and then and then later like are
you doing different stages of harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with blackberry for instance,
I'll do an initial harvest when You know
[SPEAKER_00]: early spring when you're just seeing those
new growth tips coming off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I'll harvest that for a
vegetative FPJ and Then I'll wait for the
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry to go into to bud when it gets
those nice white buds We're just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: past that stage here in southern Oregon
and it's They went to flower now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that but that budding stage the
budding right at that Like right that that
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger is like just ready to pop kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I would harvest at that stage for
that transitional stage You know when when
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants yeah, so when our plants are
transitioning from Vegetative to now
[SPEAKER_00]: flower they're going through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when I would harvest the
blackberry buds to To give some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: transitional hormones and enzymes and all
that stuff So then the final stage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry would be harvesting the fruit
Which you could use in a fermented fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: juice for you know, the later stages of
plant growth now, are you So whether you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I what are you what are you using
your this is an aside, but what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: using your?
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented fruit juices like I'm not using
them till super late and yes curious if I
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't write okay, so yeah,
yeah, um Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same that I use them only You
know about the last month of growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: for Cannabis and hemp is when I'm using
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just only for the real the real
finishing you know the flavor enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: and All that good sugar, you know giving
that to the plants So yeah, really only in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last stages there Now are you using
soil drenches all the way through in a
[SPEAKER_01]: large scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any kind of foliars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you transition and all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I Primarily, I found that doing
foliars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another way of kind of scaling up
We're pretty lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got some fancy equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this like orchard tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only like, you know four feet wide
that has Sprayers like that go up to about
[SPEAKER_00]: seven feet high and they have three
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got this I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah really stoked to use this it's um,
it'll be Nice to kind of like get through
[SPEAKER_00]: the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's You know, it's good because You
can get through really tight spaces in
[SPEAKER_00]: your rows and so for for hemp fields You
can kind of get in there and we so we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know three rows and then we'll
have Basically a five foot road for our
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor to get through That has our
sprayers on it This is brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to be using that for
our KNF engine on foliars But generally
[SPEAKER_00]: what I do is I use like an atomizer or
backpack sprayer And I have been doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of foliars that way in like our
greenhouses So I do drenches but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna use a lot more inputs that way as
well so, you know another way to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scale up and Conserve some of your inputs
and make them go a little further I found
[SPEAKER_01]: is through foliar sprays and do you carry
your foliars all the way through bloom or
[SPEAKER_01]: is There a point when you don't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we have a light depth going right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a couple weeks from harvest I just
did generally towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do Well the old term flush from
like, you know back in the day from you
[SPEAKER_00]: know indoors and using like salt based
Newts I don't like to you really use that
[SPEAKER_00]: term anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, I do so Soaks towards the
end of The final stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't like to do I cut off
foliars about two weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that Yeah, you know, I find that
you're just introducing more moisture into
[SPEAKER_00]: the phylosphere Like you can cause,
you know mildew mold but tritus And maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: damage some of the trichomes too if you're
you know, spraying too heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally like yeah, I just
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do Soil drenches in the last few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I yeah, but I carry a little yeah I
carried past the fifth weeks into six
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm curious I've heard that it
said people don't do it that far in but
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not found a problem with it But yeah
way deep into bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna yeah same reason so that
yeah Yeah So Talk about the talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting and when you're wild harvesting
for things Let's get into the etiquette
[SPEAKER_00]: around great great Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'd love to get into this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some formal training in
herbalism Had a year Course that I did in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County With Dandelion herbal
center was really fortunate to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: that program and Jane Bothwell my teacher
She's You know very very close with
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosemary Gladstar, which which The course
also I took Rosemary Gladstar as course as
[SPEAKER_00]: well sage mountain So I was able to work
Actually use KNF practices at Dandelion
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal center to Pay for my tuition for
herbalism class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, yeah, that worked out great
That's stacked functioning for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Functions permaculture for sure and so So
anyways There was there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: etiquette involved in in wild crafting and
in approaching the natural world and so um
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you walk into A natural place
like, you know into nature we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really mindful of of the space we're in
and and how we're approaching wild
[SPEAKER_00]: crafting I was always taught to first of
all ask permission and Always bring an
[SPEAKER_00]: offering as well So you never go out just
with the intention of taking like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: always giving something Back to so an
offering You know tobacco is used a lot as
[SPEAKER_00]: an offering but but really anything a
piece of chocolate just putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: intention out of like gratitude and You
know and not just walking into nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: and like I'm here to take So I was always
taught You know ask for permission and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times you can talk to the plants
and say I would like to harvest you say
[SPEAKER_00]: for a certain reason And so give that
intention out But you know Listen for
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you what is your intention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Intuition telling you from these places
that you're in Asking to take so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just say that you do get good feedback and
and So then I Would only let's say there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a stand of me Okay, and I Would only first
of all for see FPJ's we really only need
[SPEAKER_00]: the top You know three to four inches for
those growth hormones So we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: rip out all those plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: we can just take the tops off them to let
them regenerate and So we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: rip those plants out We can just take the
tops of what we actually need now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I would only harvest about It tops
40% of what I'm seeing I would always
[SPEAKER_00]: leave more than half of what I'm seeing so
I'm not going in and I'm not just like
[SPEAKER_00]: Destroying a whole stand of nettles or you
know, just as an example nettles because
[SPEAKER_00]: You know this this term regenerative,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just want it to be a catchphrase
we want to live these principles and
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and so we want we want to assist
in in regeneration we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: Wildcrafting you can be really destructive
or you can actually assist in the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and health of these wild places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Yeah, they thrive by our attention and
by our harvesting if we're if we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: like in coordination with The living
system that it's part of right which is
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely incorporates the reciprocity
and the listening and the intuition as
[SPEAKER_01]: well and that we have the responsibility
to attune ourselves to being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to what the messages are and that
it's a Real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a fun question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you but do you have any sort of like
magical moments out there harvesting when
[SPEAKER_01]: you've gotten a message or some kind of
intuition about what you're doing that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of Led you down a path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a specific moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's putting on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them Yeah, I do I do so another one
of the Herbalism schools that I've gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through is the school of evolutionary
herbalism, which is Sage Apophon who's an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing herbalist and you know alchemist
spagirist That was kind of my entrance
[SPEAKER_00]: into you know spagiric alchemy,
which is herbalism, you know alchemical
[SPEAKER_00]: herbalism so, you know, he talks about
this idea of You know heart coherence and
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can actually communicate with plants
by doing plant sits and sitting with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and If we're we open our hearts like to
this intuitive faculty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not this mental like today
in this day and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Emphasis put on the
logical Reductionistic science mind right
[SPEAKER_00]: but the intuitive heart is really
important when we're working with nature
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're working with plants plants are
electromagnetic receivers and transmitters
[SPEAKER_00]: and and we can tap into those frequencies
with our Heart if we're if we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen and so uh Well one one story I'll
give you is um, so um, Devil's Club
[SPEAKER_00]: opalopanax Is a really powerful plant used
by many of the indigenous tribes of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest and It's it's a very
very powerful medicine and so I was on
[SPEAKER_00]: this quest to find Devil's Club is really
stoked And interested to find Devil's Club
[SPEAKER_00]: and and I know it grows around the
Columbia Gorge basically kind of Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon up into Washington and up into like
BC and even into Alaska and then it also
[SPEAKER_00]: for some reason that it has a Like a
cousin that grows around Lake Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's out there, too Yeah, it is huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third coast, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways with the Devil's Club,
I I'm not gonna give the specific location
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's it's really special to me,
but So I'm driving okay, so I was it I was
[SPEAKER_00]: over in Eugene and I was giving a talk on
Korean natural farming it a permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence that happened there and so I
was heading over to Ben to a friend's farm
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards and heading through the
Willamette National Forest and I stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: by at a local waterfall and I had kind of
given up on my search thinking that Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's I got to go up to like the Columbia
River to find this plant And I had kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: given up on on my searches like that south
of Oregon more central Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I go to this waterfall and Like I'm
walking down into This ravine and like
[SPEAKER_00]: look up and it like literally knocked me
over like the power of this plant like put
[SPEAKER_00]: me on my back You know because it just has
these huge like maple looking leaves It's
[SPEAKER_00]: such a powerful plant and like the power
of that like it really like I fell back
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just sat there with this plant and
of like I found you and I can't believe it
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking for a long long time and
So yeah, that's a very special plant I
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made some spagyric preparations of
this plant and Just very very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's uh, it's been called like
Alaskan ginseng it's kind of a term that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not officially Accepted but it's closely
related to ginseng So it works on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels, you know with with herbs
you can learn a lot about herbs by by
[SPEAKER_00]: their flavors You know like bitters work
on your digestive system Different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sweet herbs are very nutritive
So you can learn a lot about herbs and
[SPEAKER_00]: what their function is physiologically
Really by the flavors and so Devil's Club
[SPEAKER_00]: is Just all over the place super complex
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime you have a really complex
flavor of a plant You know, it's working
[SPEAKER_01]: on a lot of different levels Do you have
you and you must have ingested it is it
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have some effects from it that you
especially?
[SPEAKER_00]: loved You know, it's very heart-opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very It's a very self empowering
herb, you know, I think for for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: self-work and growth and things of that
nature And I think shamanically this is
[SPEAKER_00]: also what what tribes of the Pacific
Northwest use this herb for as well So
[SPEAKER_00]: really that's kind of the level that that
I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it as a very sacred Yes,
absolutely Thank you for sharing that
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely Do you do you have I love
to hear one of your experiences with with
[SPEAKER_00]: an herb Maybe that spoke to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'll talk about one that's
been speaking to me this year a very
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising discovery because I actually
had bought it and planted it and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of noticed it popping up around the
property because What I'm trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: here is naturalize everything so it takes
about three years and it'll come it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: present but then it'll go away it'll
present into the second year and then by
[SPEAKER_01]: third year, it's like massive and then by
fourth year, it's Found its place usually
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plant was I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I planted it even though I knew it's it's
indigenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still Seated it here, but it's wild
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first year that I've Yeah,
I've actually like tuka canadense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So I stumbled on because I make leaf
protein which I'm gonna get some later
[SPEAKER_01]: time but I found out about that Through my
permaculture studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way of of isolating the proteins in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started out with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Finally so in weeding well, I I'll take
the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not weeding So I set it aside and I
decided to pull protein from it I tried
[SPEAKER_01]: the protein and it had an effect and then
I I just sort of I decided I realized that
[SPEAKER_01]: what was left was still had a lot of
oiliness and sponginess to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought And I don't tend to follow
recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let the plant tell me what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Right, so I realized like this isn't
this isn't water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the mass of Stuff that I'd
already juice taking the juice taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: protein out of it put it in alcohol The
alcohol turned the most lovely color of
[SPEAKER_01]: blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow green So this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried a bit off of it and The effect
was Incredible like it acted on the
[SPEAKER_01]: central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got rid of it Definitely, but it sort
of woke me up to the reality that I'm much
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've had issues sleeping for the
last year and that's unusual for me But I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't really being affected in any other
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was behaving normally Well,
this plant taught me that I am super
[SPEAKER_01]: jacked in my central nervous system and
that I need a lot of nurturing this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has opened me up this year to sort of
Being able to surrender deeper being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to feel at home in my own garden being
able to feel safe in my own environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and do some profound healing Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's like plant-guided Yeah,
that's like the the initiatic Properties
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants, you know, that's really what's
but you're Into it's like different plants
[SPEAKER_00]: like you get into the archetypes and
there's there's lessons that these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have to teach us Yeah, so cool so cool
actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you did I feel really bad because
the bottle like you sent me a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: the package and it was like crushed and
like You know, maybe a quarter of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: full is all you know, the box is drenched
But ironically it was the perfect amount
[SPEAKER_01]: that was left to finish Out my harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you might have wanted more but
this is what you're gonna work Nice nice
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love I love to talk about about
that specific plant that I sent you to
[SPEAKER_01]: please do Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Do you want to get into that right
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So um the plant that I sent to Tina was a
big California Bay Laurel that's
[SPEAKER_00]: californica umbel umbellilarium
umbellilaria, excuse me and it is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: very potent plant it has It has a compound
called umbellilum and it's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile oils of California Bay and So how
I came upon this plant and How I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about using it as a pesticide like a jadam
pesticide was Through my herbalism
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at some of the Native
American uses of California Bay and The
[SPEAKER_00]: the uses that I found was It was used it
was used to protect Acorns like when some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the native tribes Were were processing
acorns they would put California Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: around the acorns to protect that Acorn
meal because there's a process of leaching
[SPEAKER_00]: out those tannins and acorns to produce
bread so they would they would protect it
[SPEAKER_00]: with the California bay leaves to you
know, keep away insects or opportunistic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever From from, you know
getting the acorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I heard that I was like,
okay This has potential for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: JDOM Yeah a JDOM pesticide and sure enough
it Definitely does have way more
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using this As my primary go-to
for all kinds of problems for example last
[SPEAKER_00]: year when I first got to The hemp farm I'm
currently working with there's a horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation of hemp aphids and so I I had
some of the California Bay I made a JDOM
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal solution, which is essentially an
herbal decoction that you do with water
[SPEAKER_00]: You know just boil it steam it trap all
those volatile oils and then you would mix
[SPEAKER_00]: that with the JDOM wetting agent,
which is essentially a cast-steel soap and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I mixed the two together and Found that
perfect rate to where we had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs, you know that came to save the
day too, so I was trying to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect balance of okay, where can I
Destroy like all the hemp aphids but also
[SPEAKER_00]: save the lady but the lady beetles and
their larva so and I found that balance
[SPEAKER_00]: and We had this crazy infestation of hemp
aphids and the first application I used of
[SPEAKER_00]: the California Bay Laurel with the wetting
agent Took care of most of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean probably 80% of the aphids were
gone after one application The second
[SPEAKER_00]: application I came back a week later
Sprayed again totally done two
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and and they were toast so
I've also used the Bay Laurel for powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, botrytis Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Wendy was talking about that
application this year at the regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: conference and Basically our trials your
trials went Tina and when is as well with
[SPEAKER_00]: the with the with the California Bay
Laurel, so It's it is an absolute all-star
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only use a couple of other herbs for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use like bracken fern Ginkgo biloba
is you know, one of Choyong song's
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite But it's just not as potent and
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found as as the Bay Laurel is just an
all-star So Chris is asking Chris Trump
[SPEAKER_01]: has joined the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says have you used the JWA by itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he was trialing that just this last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, I have Specifically for hemp
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find that it it took care of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does help I mean even with normal
aphids you can just spray them off with
[SPEAKER_00]: water and it doesn't kill them,
but you you at least kind of make it yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupt their their their flow and So I
have used the wetting agent by itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't found that it that it will
kill all the aphids When you come when you
[SPEAKER_00]: couple that with the Bay Laurel Now we
really got a powerful weapon to use
[SPEAKER_00]: against them and it was amazing because it
didn't kill the ladybugs either And I can
[SPEAKER_00]: talk I can talk about the ratios that I
used yeah, please do okay, so Because I I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't written down what I used and I
found the same thing to be True to two
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and also just to comment on
the power of using that Korean natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming or natural farming methods in
conjunction with all this is that like it
[SPEAKER_01]: gave the plant a break from the onslaught
in enough time for the application or for
[SPEAKER_01]: its what it was getting from the natural
farming applications to just Come rushing
[SPEAKER_01]: forth so they both act and just Which was
very evident right yeah, so I Love you
[SPEAKER_01]: too, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to see you He just said he loves
us both I Love the community that is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening around natural farming it's like
community happens the best and the most
[SPEAKER_01]: Lasting when we're actually doing things
that are helpful And then when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: finding when we're abundantly helpful to
ourselves and what's around us then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: abundantly helpful with each other,
which is kind of it just this natural
[SPEAKER_00]: outflow happens and Yeah, it's such a
great community, you know and What I find
[SPEAKER_00]: is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you know people sharing their
experiences being open source with yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know these practices in a different
region because I've been fortunate to to
[SPEAKER_00]: practice this, you know go around and
train in Hawaii and Go to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: practice in California and Oregon and out
in Idaho with Chris and the soil Smith's
[SPEAKER_00]: and It's so cool to see how You know those
different leverage points And how how it
[SPEAKER_00]: changes so, you know, it's a different
approach wherever you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's it's gonna be a little different I
think that's really important To keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get too fixed and like
oh, but so we were gonna talk about your
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios We might as well cover that and we
got another hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So the ratio that I'm using for the
California Bay Laurel, yeah with JDOM
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding agent I use this for dealing with
hemp aphids and found that it also saved
[SPEAKER_00]: the ladybugs and their larva so that ratio
was a half ounce of the JDOM herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: solution so essentially just to go over
that for for people unfamiliar that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a decoction of Bay Laurel you
essentially Take all the leaves and you
[SPEAKER_00]: would simmer that in a pot Covered pot and
you would you would make a strong herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: decoction from that So, you know you bring
it to boil and let that simmer for I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually let it simmer for hour and a half
or so to get all those good volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds out of it and then so then you
have your Your decoction also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: JDOM herbal solution and you can mix that
with your Your carrier, which is the JWA
[SPEAKER_00]: the JDOM wedding agent So again the the
ratio on that is a half an ounce of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay Laurel JDOM herbal solution the
decoction and I would mix two ounces of
[SPEAKER_00]: the JDOM wedding agent per gallon and so I
found that was that really works awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: for for dealing with hemp aphids and Again
saving the the lady beetles so that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of that's kind of the balance you're
looking for and What you can do is just
[SPEAKER_00]: pull a leaf off, you know create a little
laboratory wherever you're at just pull a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf off your your crop that's infected
with whatever you're trying to combat and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can just mix these solutions to
find the the appropriate ratio that's
[SPEAKER_01]: working So you're basically treating some
infested part and then looking under a
[SPEAKER_01]: Microscope or a magnifying glass to see
the effect on the population and then
[SPEAKER_01]: going with that ratio Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it's important right to use Non
like I did I first I made it in with just
[SPEAKER_01]: using spring water, which is heavily
mineral, but no you it's like No,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to use it in this city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point You have to use rain
water is what I always use because It's
[SPEAKER_00]: more it's more acidic if you use a more
alkaline water then That's it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: mix correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and if you're making liquid soap such
as you know, Jadam wedding agent a You
[SPEAKER_00]: know a liquid Castile soap you have to
also use More acidic water if it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna work And a good visual in
case you don't have a pH around is already
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't know what water you're using
is when it's cloudy It's not if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: outline, but when it's more clear,
it's more acidic so you can know that way,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true Cool and it does make a
difference Big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Big difference Yeah, well,
it won't mix correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see like when you when you have it
mixed properly, you'll see bubbles form
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you don't it it becomes cloudy and
it doesn't look the same So so yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you you definitely know when you've made
correct You know soap Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you ever use the JWA in or What do
you what are your thoughts on using it in
[SPEAKER_01]: concert with like?
[SPEAKER_01]: applications of You know type two or type
three Do you feel like because I just
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, so I just did a type two which is
using the fish amino Acids and I had so
[SPEAKER_01]: much oil that I ended up adding a little
of the JWA just to get the oil to to mix
[SPEAKER_01]: with the water a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's kind of a
adulteration?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, like I'm open to that kind of
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't think it's adulteration I just
haven't personally Had a need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I know some people are scraping the
the oils off for their FAA I generally
[SPEAKER_00]: keep my my FAA I keep it I like to keep it
whole whole so I like to keep those oils
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Just shake it up while you're
applying and yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep So I haven't really experimented with
using oils of fish in that in that way
[SPEAKER_00]: that approach But if it's working for you,
then yeah, yeah, I just did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did it this last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know Yeah, you know I've been so
stoked with my results with the Bay Laurel
[SPEAKER_00]: in the wedding agent is such a powerful
combination that honestly, I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: really look for other herbs to really use
and I'd like to say this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so At the regenerative conference
this last year there was a speaker and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna name names or you know throwing
anybody under the bus, but there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker talking about pesticides and and
she mentioned that a petroleum based
[SPEAKER_00]: product was less of a Had less of an
environmental impact than using certain
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs and she was totally Putting down the
use of herbs as pesticides and I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like mind blown like what this lady is
talking about this at a regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: conference Basically saying the
environmental impact of harvesting herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: is greater than using some petroleum
extracted product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Let's call it let's call it out
because this to me is one of the major
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations that needs to happen out
there for us to sort of wake up to our
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerative place in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there are basically two camps
of people There are the people who feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like we are part of nature and that we're
our place is necessary here that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the ecosystem and then there are
people who are being convinced and taught
[SPEAKER_01]: and believe that that people are the
problem and like I'm Like so in it like
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance in wild harvesting and wild
crafting It's been shown that like if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing proper harvesting and you're
keeping to that 40% ratio that you spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: to earlier then that stand of wild plants
will actually flourish and thrive under
[SPEAKER_01]: your Stewardship and care and so we come
into proper stewardship with our planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very much a part of the garden
Absolutely, yeah essential to the garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you know, yeah Maybe the you
know making the argument that us
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting and wild crafting is gonna be
harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's just It's because we need
to learn how to come into harmony with our
[SPEAKER_00]: world Yeah, I agree and it could be like
if you're if we go back to like
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating that stand of nettle We were
talking about then it could be destructive
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the argument is very hard to
make that a petroleum extracted product Is
[SPEAKER_00]: less damaging to the earth and using herbs
and for me it comes down to Bay Laurel
[SPEAKER_00]: again It's like these massive trees grow
in Northern, California in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known as Oregon Myrtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant Oregon up here up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own name down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's California Bay Laurel But anyways,
so I mean these these trees grow massive
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's and it's so potent like you
don't need much like a branch of this I
[SPEAKER_00]: can Make enough to spray four greenhouses
You know hundred foot by thirty foot and
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of an aphid infestation with one
branch off of a huge tree So there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: much of an environmental impact going on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm doing this on a large scale,
too Do you think that you're losing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sold on the method because it
works so well, but have you ever thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about like capturing being a spagiarist
capturing the essential oils first and
[SPEAKER_01]: then sort of using a spagiaric Approach of
re you know, like adding those volatiles
[SPEAKER_01]: back in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done much interesting you ask
Here is the sulfur or the essential oil of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay Laurel Now now I'm doing distillations
of The you can see the the bubbles are
[SPEAKER_01]: that's Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, did you have to open your windows
and doors to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's another Thing I should mention
if you're working with Bay Laurel,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not want to do this in your house I
mean, there's a reason it's a powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide and It is very very powerful I
mean, it's actually one of its nicknames
[SPEAKER_00]: is is a headache tree because it causes
gives umbellolone that volatile oil causes
[SPEAKER_00]: headaches and a lot of people I'm
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely love the smell of bait But this
is this is really powerful Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this this was a This much here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah was I'm working with Two liter
distillation apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, so this was let's see like to To
distillation so my bio flask my bio flask
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially, this is is two distillations
of two two liters of Bay Laurel,
[SPEAKER_00]: so honestly like not all that much It's
very high in these in these volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and they're very powerful So I
am experimenting now with doing
[SPEAKER_00]: distillations and adding straight
essential oils into my genome wedding
[SPEAKER_00]: agent Rather than rather than doing the
the herbal decoction, but the herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: decoction works really well It's plenty
right are you going so far as to burn to
[SPEAKER_01]: white ash and add the minerals or anything
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't done like a spagyric
application For the plants, but I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do Yeah, it's just you know,
I want to use it You know where I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: use it is in the is in the vinegars So
after so after making the FPJ is taking
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant material making the vinegar and
then taking the leftover plant material
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it to white ash Deriving the
minerals and putting it back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: vinegars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's gonna change the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of like Anyway, right Yeah,
we should cuz that that's a that's a deep
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbit hole right and it's a very exciting
Method and in very ancient ancient roots
[SPEAKER_00]: into antiquity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So What's your feeling on the relationship
between?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spagyric and natural farming because I see
them kind of like pretty hand-in-hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you caught by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've often wondered Some of the
approaches to Korean natural farming do
[SPEAKER_00]: have some alchemical kind of background
and You know, I think I think One of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that strikes me is the the preparation of
OHN for instance we do a fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: before we actually Do a tincture and so
that's very that's very similar to how you
[SPEAKER_00]: would approach a spagyric to Spagyric you
would you would release the the sulfur or
[SPEAKER_00]: the essential oil first the soul of that
plant and then you would do a Fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: to release the spirits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Korean natural farming we are doing
fermentation along with our With our
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation so it's it's gets it's
similar to the alchemical approach for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we're not taking it as far as is
calcinating down the plant matter and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know adding the salts back to it,
but you know, there are elements of
[SPEAKER_00]: Alchemy within Korean natural farming is
definitely You know an esoteric science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I know I believe one of master
chose teachers was really inspiring by
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudolf Steiner of Bio-dynamic farming and
you know, he was very much into alchemy
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's fun to explore the
interface So we touched on everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have that's in your outline Preston
Preston prepared an outline for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so like thrilled with I did however,
I've been bouncing all over the place not
[SPEAKER_00]: really using it So I guess I could go back
and just kind of talk more about you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite herbs as far as okay,
great, so You know as I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier the idea of really trying to grow
your own Fertilizers so part of your crop
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking ahead of time like how many how
many like if we're doing acreage
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh phone battery is getting kind of low
here Okay, I'm gonna talk fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Might have to go plug in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um You want to do you want to try to do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm gonna make my way over and plug
in while we're talking here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do that We don't want to lose
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cuz we'll distill all this stuff
down talking about spagyric like my intent
[SPEAKER_01]: for these Conversations is to gather as
much material as possible and then
[SPEAKER_01]: condense down later and come out with you
know some kind of a podcast that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: all use together so We want to make sure
we get all the information from you that
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted to share Yeah, so I would I
would be thinking first and foremost about
[SPEAKER_00]: Throwing some of your own fertilizers So
that would be on my mind first Secondly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be looking for Plants that are
really showing up for you that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance, you know different You know
plants that are Possibly invasives in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area that are taken over They make great
fertilizers You know things like fennel
[SPEAKER_00]: really juicy horsetail fennel Comfrey they
make great fertilizers because they they
[SPEAKER_00]: render a lot of juices Yeah, somebody's
asking you about seaweed FPJ seaweed FPJ
[SPEAKER_00]: is awesome definitely because it's very
abundant if you live on the coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just plugging in real quick So yeah
seaweed FPJ, it's it's very abundant so I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to look for You know herbs plants
like that That are that are very abundant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know because there's never gonna be a
shortage so Seaweed FPJ is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to do You know Jadam style
liquid ferments with seaweed that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: really fun, too So, let's see Are you are
your horsetail are you making a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional FPJ out of that and I Find
that to be a juicy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Absolutely, it's what it renders one of
them like the most juices out of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the FPJs that I make You know,
so right now it's getting more mature so
[SPEAKER_00]: as the name implies, it looks like a
horsetail the the leaves kind of Freight
[SPEAKER_00]: out and it looks like a horsetail the best
time really to harvest it is before it
[SPEAKER_00]: does that when their shoots are just
coming right out of the ground before it
[SPEAKER_00]: opens up and there's a ton of juices and
in horsetail so it's one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: FPJs because You know, let's just compare
it with nettle what I was finding from
[SPEAKER_00]: nettle FPJ to Horsetail FPJ I would get
about twice the juices from horsetail that
[SPEAKER_00]: I would nettles so Being strategic about
what we're harvesting to for large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: Nettle is a lot of work to It makes a
great FPJ super nutrient dense But it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a lot of work to harvest
For making large-scale, you know FPJ
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented plant juices, so I Like to use
skunk cabbage because it's very abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it's very juicy Fennel again is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also very abundant on the coast very juicy
Comfrey growing comfrey makes a great FPJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Also renders a lot of juice so really
there's only For larger scale stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really to me it's even using
nettle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I do Make nettle FPJs,
but I'm very careful with my application
[SPEAKER_00]: of those I'll use them in a foliar spray
because You know, it's it's just so hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to render a lot of juice from it so This
is where application rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's your um?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's how much material are you using per
acre?
[SPEAKER_00]: typically That's a great question like
material as far as making FPJs Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like how much are you having to harvest
per acre?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have that number or do you know I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't done those calcs because for me as
I mentioned earlier, I'm substituting in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jadam liquid fertilizers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's hard for me to say You know,
I do pickle barrel batches of nettle and
[SPEAKER_00]: horsetail so you know, I'm able to I have
about 10 gallons of You know nettle FPJ
[SPEAKER_00]: and horsetail I get about 10 gallons from
from the same amount of material so You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I'm using that Very carefully in
foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some soil drenches, but primarily I'm
using the foliar sprays To help make that
[SPEAKER_00]: go further And then as I mentioned
substituting in the Jadam liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers is also I find that to Yeah,
it's just it's easier to make Jadam liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer than it is fermented plant
juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's There's more resources sources for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You essentially just chop up You know
grasses and weeds and whatever you have
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw it in a ferment in water And you
have a fertilizer so it really simplifies
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go buy a bunch of sugar
So so anyways, yeah, I like I like the
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of the two nice What are you
doing for your vinegars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you making your own vinegars from your
material from your FPJs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using brown rice vinegar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I am I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love vinegars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love In Korean not to farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always it's I'm always joking and it's
not really a joke It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the byproducts of Korean nacho
farming are our cheese and wine So I love
[SPEAKER_00]: that and so with the spent You know the
FPJ solids that are left over after your
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can you can make Vinegars from
those you can throw it in a tub full of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so one part plant with like two
parts water and some Usually there's
[SPEAKER_00]: enough extra sugar that you'll be alright
You could toss some extra sugar in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you could pitch like a kombucha
or a John Scobie in there That really kick
[SPEAKER_00]: starts the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use John Scobie's with all my vinegars
Made some really nice like mugwort
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegars and nettle vinegars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can also make one Wines,
you know, which would essentially it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing only you would do an anaerobic
ferment rather than aerobic ferment for
[SPEAKER_00]: the vinegars anaerobic for the wine Do you
throw extra yeast in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do pitch my own yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean Theoretically you could you
could pitch some Local material some plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter some fruit and inoculate with a
local yeast, but I usually kick start like
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily, I'm using a John culture for
for all my vinegars and Then so to take
[SPEAKER_00]: that a step further with these plants,
so let's say we made fermented plant juice
[SPEAKER_00]: of mugwort, let's just say so then you
would Collect your juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have those solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a wine or vinegar out of
those All right, and then when you're done
[SPEAKER_00]: with that what I'm doing with those scraps
now is I'm actually making a mixed compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and This year I made With all my food
scraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a mixed compost with all my spent
vinegar and FPGA Solids and then all my
[SPEAKER_00]: food scraps and I was amazed at I did this
mixed compost pile with all that layered
[SPEAKER_00]: in You know cardboard and did kind of a
lasagna with IMO sprinkled in and soaked
[SPEAKER_00]: my cardboard and lacquer acetic acid
bacteria and just kind of did layers and
[SPEAKER_00]: Created the most beautiful compost that
I'm gonna make an IMO five with it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed compost and I mean just from my food
scraps and the the solids from these
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegars and stuff you know, I made like a
whole truck bed full of compost and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dressed my veggie garden with all that
That's beautiful Yeah, so so really we can
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three steps to using that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there there is no waste
You know waste is a human design flaw in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no waste It's a principle I take
seriously That's beautiful Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I love what you're up to these clay
balls have me fascinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm gonna send you some I'm gonna send
you some and I wanted I want your feed
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm still I'm still everybody I'm
still planting out there I'm still gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be working on this video, which is full
disclosure, but I might as well take this
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to do it I mean the recipe for
the fermented clay comes from the the
[SPEAKER_01]: green book Right,
[SPEAKER_01]: so basically that's gonna give you the
basic fermented clay recipe and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: took that further and added And did the
Bokashi from that and I also actually will
[SPEAKER_01]: take that opportunity I'm gonna be I have
this is I'll send you some of this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Bokashi from the same The same
inoculant so everybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think we should be Supporting each
other in economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do still buy my balls,
but make your own Yeah, absolutely Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a recipe from dad so it's like,
you know, it's a whole process so you're
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizing pond water and I mean I'm
throwing a bunch of stuff in there like
[SPEAKER_01]: the I'm making sure that I'm getting into
that biofilm at the in the in the pristine
[SPEAKER_01]: pond areas and just trying to capture as
much of that strata as I can and what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean what I'm just talk about this sort of
cross-talk that happens when we get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with these natural systems and
how our intuition works and how You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean natural farming really does bring
forward this ability to communicate with
[SPEAKER_01]: nature in ways that we're not used to
right So just working with balls and
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the facultatives and the
anaerobic bacteria I'm I'm looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire World differently like I'm seeing
everything from the clays the salts of
[SPEAKER_01]: silts all the way up to the layers of
facultative into the aerobics and into
[SPEAKER_01]: those top layers and into the trophic
layers of insects and animals and plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and then like trees and clouds and sky
like we're all in these stretch it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: stratification and Like it we're all this
crosstalk going on All through that system
[SPEAKER_01]: and there is no waste and we are a part of
it a part of nature and there's just this
[SPEAKER_01]: infinite level of communication that
happens all the way from the clays to the
[SPEAKER_01]: clouds and then a circular motion all the
way back through so Anyway that I Sounded
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned just now But it's these bought they
just be working with these guys working
[SPEAKER_01]: with the facultatives as it has taught me
so much about the layers, I guess the
[SPEAKER_01]: stratification the way The way nature is
the way life evolved the way make the way
[SPEAKER_01]: life evolves from From clay the way we
come from clay right and the way that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the amplification moment That's kind of
the moment when clay becomes food and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this like amplification that
happens from there and if we can start you
[SPEAKER_01]: Writing that way of and helping that
amplification to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we start to see this this
Regenerative cycle start to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I haven't experimented with the clays
or Yeah, there's some really cool stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: that that song book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been checking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, and I think as a community if
we're playing let's be clear Transparent
[SPEAKER_01]: about it all and you know supporting of
each other So yeah, I'll send you some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these and I'd love to hear back what you
end up doing with them Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just like in the reservoir you
just drop them in you don't even have to
[SPEAKER_01]: aerate I mean, I love the anaerobics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just they're very low left like
low maintenance Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're and they're actually cleaning my
pumps Wow, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah getting the clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting the clay from the pond to
or where do you harvest your clay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting I'm actually working with
different kinds of clay right now I think
[SPEAKER_01]: every clay probably has a different a
different quality This particular clay I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: getting from an area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very Has been extremely active like
there's you can find dinosaur bones in
[SPEAKER_01]: this canyon like it's you know I think the
clay is pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a red clay But it's yeah,
but I'm So many with greens and white
[SPEAKER_01]: clays right now, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh cool Yeah, there's a there's a lot of
great clay along the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found, you know big sections of gray
clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be fun to experiment Oh,
yeah, and Jess I know when she did some
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented clay she got a lot of the purple
sulfur Loving stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oh nice, but I don't I didn't get so I
don't know Layton's gonna help me figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what's in these Great, but I can talk
about observation being a guide like Just
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that these but this clay is
an insane food supply for insects informs
[SPEAKER_01]: me of what kind of Antaropes were dealing
with and that there's actually a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: source of chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yes Man aerobic community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Yeah, I don't need to go collect crab
shells from the beach and do it Tom style
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid ferment No, I think it's simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can get it in Wow,
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea right I know Yeah,
yeah, I have done some of the Jadam style
[SPEAKER_00]: like the chitin with crab shells I really
liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I found it to be very effective
and Just it's so I always joke with Jadam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like yeah, just toss it in a bucket
of water with leaf mold and You know from
[SPEAKER_00]: from human waste to you know from food
scraps to plants to you know shells To
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I mean, that's kind of the
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes breakdowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Right So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a huge package to get off to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna include some of the some of the
lettuce Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait It's gonna have clay balls in
it and I promise you I'm gonna get that
[SPEAKER_01]: off today actually today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna do that Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked Is there anything else that we
need to cover that are in your notes or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know while we're on the wedding agent,
um, yeah, I Would like to talk about real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean pretty much covered what I wanted
to as far as Plants and wild crafting and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mixing Jadam and And can't have
both if anybody wants to add some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions on any of that, you know,
we could take some questions but While
[SPEAKER_00]: we're kind of talking about Jadam wedding
agent There's so many uses for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a surfactant it's it's a
it's a wedding agent so you can put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: your reservoirs to help with the lateral
disbursement of feeds in your soil You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's a surfactant so you can use it
in your foliar sprays to help as a carrier
[SPEAKER_00]: to carry some of these herbs and other
Additive sulfur or what have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know mineral sands are also good to
intensify insecticides in you know in So
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'd like to share this making I've
been making a lot more biochar this last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years Been doing a lot of biochar
super stoked about biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's yeah It's the best amendment
you could put in the ground especially
[SPEAKER_00]: when you charge it and I feel like Korean
actual farming has Amazing tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does Jadam for helping to charge
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this wasn't scheduled in for the
subjects of talk on on this specific talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one other application I thought was
really cool in regards to Biochar was so I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in Bend I was I was doing a burn in
Bend at a friend's farm was being
[SPEAKER_00]: consulted to make some biochar and we had
four acres of hemp residue this massive
[SPEAKER_00]: pile of hemp and so we dug this huge pit
and You know like ten guys from the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood came over and we started a
fire and we're just you know chucking big
[SPEAKER_00]: trees of you know hemp trees into this
fire to keep this fire fed and We burned
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way through the day and then it
you know, it got dark and So we were
[SPEAKER_00]: burning a bit into the dark and then the
fire department showed up and they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys can't burn Into the dark like
you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on ag land like you you dug this
huge pit You guys are all good there But
[SPEAKER_00]: like you just can't burn into the night
and we're like, okay We'll put it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then keep kind of like the firefighter
laughed at me because we have this huge
[SPEAKER_00]: pile like this volcano of you know biochar
that's still smoldering and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm out there with the hose just hosing
it down and he said he's he mentioned he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like well just use a wedding agent go get
some dish soap and it like triggered in my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind I was like, yes, that's it because
when you're trying to extinguish a pile of
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar Like oh, yeah, first of all,
that's a big pile like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's evaporation happening,
but a lot of it's Going straight down
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like if you add so what you can do
is add some of the the the wedding agent
[SPEAKER_00]: to that water That you're quenching your
biochar with and it's gonna help
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguish that better because it helps
with the lateral disbursement rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: just Going vertical down So you can put
out a fire a lot easier Yeah, I bet it has
[SPEAKER_01]: a quality too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it kind of it helps with the
penetration I bet it helps with the
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bet it has qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, too Yeah, I'm continuously
amazed at all the applications for for
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding agents I mean household uses too,
but but in the in the garden, it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that Like to extinguish
biochar too Because I mean we literally
[SPEAKER_00]: had a sprinkler on our this massive pile
of biochar four acres of hemp that was
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced down and sprinkler going all night
and And You know, it still was is still
[SPEAKER_00]: smoldering the next day So, you know,
we weren't super efficient some of it went
[SPEAKER_00]: to ash, you know If you don't put it out
just goes to ash, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: sequester that carbon so I was really
stoked on just you know that idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: adding the wedding agent To to quenching,
you know the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for thank you for that I'm deaf
because I learned I learned how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar from you that video you put out on
Facebook the next day I was out there
[SPEAKER_01]: making biochar and I'm So yeah,
now even in this product now, it's all my
[SPEAKER_01]: own biochar and it's hemp and it's all the
sort of stems from last year's harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: like orac I do a lot with orac and And
I've been putting out the fire using rice
[SPEAKER_01]: hall So I'll get a huge container of rice
also as I'm burning the fire and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: start with the big pieces first And then I
go to the smaller and smaller and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: suffocate the fire as I go with the rice
with the rice hole Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it's literally made the biochar
at the end is probably at least a third
[SPEAKER_01]: Rice hole in addition to everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see so you're not quenching With water
then I am at the very very end,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm definitely quenching as I go so
I'm not that major work It does do the
[SPEAKER_01]: work of suffocation as it goes so it's
kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll have to try that with the rice
holes It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's rice hole biochar is some
of the most ancient biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I think Different cultures across
the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making biochar out of Oops,
where'd you go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be our end how's it is
everybody else still getting reception or
[SPEAKER_01]: did we lose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Preston We certainly got a lot of
information in This session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we're gonna be talking to Preston
again to share and The sooner that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: get yeah, he went the sooner that we can
get Together as a working community
[SPEAKER_01]: actually doing the work of regeneration
the sooner that we can I believe we can
[SPEAKER_01]: restore our planet in a matter of I used
to think it was seven years with
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture and I believe that we came if
we all do a concerted effort we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: this in three years and Preston with his
earlier part of this talk Talked about how
[SPEAKER_01]: he remediated his property that was
basically collegiate And hard clays in a
[SPEAKER_01]: matter of three months using a mixture of
lab and JMS, so I'm super excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: the talk that we just had and And I'm
definitely going to be Getting this live
[SPEAKER_01]: to you all on Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you missed anything you can join
wood shavings work like the rice halls
[SPEAKER_01]: sure, I mean But the right I like the rice
halls, especially for well for so many
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons It has the silica in it,
but also just the shape of it is I Don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something just aesthetically
Beautiful and I think aesthetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: function go hand-in-hand sometimes that
little moon shape of that it has I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just it's good for aerating the soil
and All kinds of thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get him back
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy midsummer from Sweden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be rewatching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy to see you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Monica Okay, yeah, we will Well,
I mean it's just signaling the the height
[SPEAKER_00]: of the solar day here, you know us being
on the Eve of the summer solstice my phone
[SPEAKER_00]: My phone just turned off from heat
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a sign Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any ceremonies planned for
this evening or any kind of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well tomorrow just happens to be my
birthday Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you just had one You know that you
know that night we met in the alley when
[SPEAKER_01]: we were in Boise, yeah Yeah, are you gonna
go this year by the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um You know, I would like to I would like
to you know, it's it's possible to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that October?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I August Yeah Possibly if I can sneak
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would love to love to that's
always such a good I'd like to find a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to see you again or visit anyway,
but like that so so that night I did a
[SPEAKER_01]: poll downstairs in the in the basement of
that dinner to find out how many Gemini's
[SPEAKER_01]: were in the room and do you know of the
soil stewards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a good more than half of us are
Gemini's Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, isn't that weird?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like yeah, I think Gemini Gemini's tend to
be natural farmers for some reason it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems Yeah, yeah interesting, okay Anyway,
happy birthday fellow Gemini.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too and happy happy solstice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right on the even and Fire ring
Eclipse too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's really powerful as well
So speaking of firing somebody just asked
[SPEAKER_00]: about making biochar in a fire pit And
yeah, you can make biochar on a fire pit
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make it I do it Yeah, likewise You know,
I've made it in little hibachis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know little Barbecue hibachis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a demonstration in Hawaii when I was
there And did it in a little hibachi was
[SPEAKER_00]: all I had and we made biochar on a real
small scale but that fire pit is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially I Use really like archaic
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love like archaic technology
technologies and so like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just dig a pit and so this is like
the Contiki kiln which essentially you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just dig a pit in the ground to do biochar
And then the specific angle, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: really works with the thermal dynamics in
producing it You know in a very in a
[SPEAKER_00]: method that's very efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: Question absolutely you can you can make
biochar enough in a fire pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's So it's really basic it just comes
down to pyrolysis You know, you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: really hot core and then you want to
reduce oxidation So anytime you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: white ash is when you want to feed that
fire fuel So you need a really hot core
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you need to continuously feed
that fire And like you were saying about
[SPEAKER_00]: the rice
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not burning efficiently you're
you're releasing carbon and those
[SPEAKER_01]: volatiles off Yeah, and then yeah not
seeing get getting to that point where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hot enough not to see smoke and then
every time you see ash is when I take
[SPEAKER_01]: basically a handful of char and I throw it
right at that spot and then if you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: like Managing the white ash at that point
then you can really you can really control
[SPEAKER_01]: how much You can keep it a pretty
efficient production of char Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it got kind of tricky on a
large scale when I was you know that burn
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't bend where we had the four acres
I mean literally we had ten guys throwing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know hemp trees on that thing Talk
about like feeding a dragon that thing was
[SPEAKER_00]: insane We could have been more efficient
there was definitely some oxidation we
[SPEAKER_00]: were seeing like some some white ash But
you know, we we also at the end of that
[SPEAKER_00]: burn we had uh, I think we got about four
You know f-150 truck beds of biochar from
[SPEAKER_00]: that burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We uh We inoculated that charged it with
JMS you know microbial solution sea water
[SPEAKER_00]: and Some humic acid before applying that
out to the fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you let that sit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you did you do it to saturation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big proponent of Being patient with
your biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of some different information
online about Charging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think charging biochars is is one of the
Most overlooked things with biochar like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of biochar out there for
sale and it is not all created equal
[SPEAKER_00]: Charging is like really crucial because if
you don't charge your biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're essentially putting out a carbon
sponge That's gonna leach up any nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: in your soil and that might take years for
it to charge It's gonna rob those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients from your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So charging Is absolutely crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's even some of these bigger
companies that are using like fish
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate I don't think that's a good
way to to charge biochar there's a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: I was privy to be part of a interesting
conversation when I was in Hawaii and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I was sitting with master Cho and
and this guy came to the workshop who was
[SPEAKER_00]: making all this FAA fish amino acids and
he was kind of using this method that was
[SPEAKER_00]: not like the way master Cho teaches it,
you know, essentially what he was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: was filling buckets with fish and then
Actually adding some water in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then capping it with sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wasn't Equally using you know fish
and sugar together he was just capping it
[SPEAKER_00]: with sugar and had this root and so he
brought like a sample of this stuff and It
[SPEAKER_00]: was super watered down and it was just it
was really funny because I'm sitting there
[SPEAKER_00]: with him and master Cho and master Cho his
granddaughter is translating for him and
[SPEAKER_00]: and so just the expression on his face
when this guy showed his the the biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: and In his FA well, the FAA was super,
you know watered down and master Cho's
[SPEAKER_00]: just like no, no, no, no like you need to
layer this with sugar and But then he was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about charging it with his
charging the biochar with the FA well the
[SPEAKER_00]: FAA that he was creating and Master Cho
was like no, no, no, no, you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get like a good enough spectrum of
microbes from using like fish emulsion or
[SPEAKER_00]: a fish product charging your biochar so
this is where like IMO really comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have this like broader
spectrum of microbes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I love adding biochar To making IMO
three piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that's that's a really good
approach to gorgeous process of charging
[SPEAKER_00]: but um, yeah, I'll generally let my
biochar I like to make it in the burn
[SPEAKER_00]: months, you know, because right now like
burn seasons over it can't even burn right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you know, it's really sensitive here
in Oregon, California and So I'll make it
[SPEAKER_00]: in those burn months and then I put it in
barrels and I make my JMS my IMO tease
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid IMO tease and Charge it For two to
three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's necessary to charge biochar
I'm not somebody who thinks you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: like charge biochar in a week and there is
Some information out there, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: saying stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it takes time Yeah, so I was
listening to some of master chose lectures
[SPEAKER_01]: and There was I kind of pulled a soil
recipe and he was he mentioned that he was
[SPEAKER_01]: treating The biochar with vinegar and you
know biochar is naturally at alkaline You
[SPEAKER_01]: ever do any and I kind of figured out what
it would take to get it to about a six
[SPEAKER_01]: point eight or something was about an
ounce of vinegar to saturated char That's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do that even before I Charge it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you finding that the alkalinity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Give any insight into that Well one one
thing to add is one of the byproducts of
[SPEAKER_00]: making biochar is what's called wood
vinegar Which is being used has some
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting Some research is being
done in it has a history of being used in
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan and elsewhere There you go again I
Guess there's a saturation point for
[SPEAKER_01]: shared knowledge Okay, we should have
taken that opportunity to say goodbye This
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna be fun this could be fun can talk
about so there was a question about
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about fermented seawater On the
coast so I'm not able to utilize real
[SPEAKER_01]: seawater so I end up using sea salt a lot
and My fermentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you're you welcome It's really nice
to see you all here and So yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm my fermented seawater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes the form of just adding you know
Following the recipe that I have and
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving it for 24 hours, but I'm sure that
Preston would have something different to
[SPEAKER_01]: say about fermented seawater So we'll get
some information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well at the next conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a mark I'll put a note in to to
talk about Or some of you coast dwellers
[SPEAKER_01]: will talk about seawater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris might have some insight to that too
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get some information out It's
been really fun you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm really enjoying these Friday
sessions and Get in touch with me if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's anything you want to know about or
if anybody wants to come on and talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: their experiences or you know,
I just feel like this is an official be a
[SPEAKER_01]: platform for us to have conversations and
really Have conversations about the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are really beginning to matter in our
world like I'm just coming into this
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness of what's actually happening
with with the plants immune function and
[SPEAKER_01]: our relationship with this with the micro
microbial world including the anaerobics
[SPEAKER_01]: right as The corona virus is coming into
our awareness and I just there's just such
[SPEAKER_01]: a disconnect between what's really
happening in our world and how we're it's
[SPEAKER_01]: being interpreted for us as far as policy
and In trying to isolate us so I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: these platforms are really important
because we need to be able to come
[SPEAKER_01]: together and talk openly and Free source
about these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna go live one more time and
we're gonna say probably Give it Let this
[SPEAKER_01]: be an opportunity to say goodbye and we
will see you again soon We're connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: back hi again I'm sitting in the shade now
because I keep getting temperature like my
[SPEAKER_00]: phone keeps dying from temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting so hot Wow Well, I appreciate
you taking time out of your busy schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing what you're doing to share so
much information Preston, I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah pleasure for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I love the open source community
and natural farming and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculture and and really herbalism too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, I think that's it's a really
beautiful thing to to have people share
[SPEAKER_00]: their experience and and you know support
and I just want to continue, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: doing so in in that In this beautiful
community that we all are in Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and somebody did ask about seawater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have fermented seawater?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any insights to share real
quick before we say goodbye on that line
[SPEAKER_00]: or um Well, yeah, I have been doing
fermented seawater and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get these like blooms of like purple
Bacteria from from my seawater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am getting some you know photo
bacteria in my Seawater, so that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting so anyways that the the water the
seawater that I'm adding to my My feeds is
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented seawater and and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I think it just micronizes everything
down you get a nice Array of some some
[SPEAKER_00]: just another layer of of microbes,
you know from the sea so you're adding
[SPEAKER_00]: more diversity from that biology From the
ocean mixing that with like your IMOs and
[SPEAKER_00]: your facultative anaerobes Creating more
diversity, which is the name of the game
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's That's how nature works,
you know Diversity diversity is king.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know there there is if we have
time there's oh we have so much time you
[SPEAKER_00]: go Okay, so I guess like I was earlier I
was talking about um Kind of jumping all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about like mixing JDOM and
KNF and so the major differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: approach of the two is that with Korean
actual farming you are actually relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: the resilience of your soil building your
soil and the immunity of your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so It's preventative measures whereas JDOM
you have this whole arsenal of pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: to use and JDOM has a protocol where you
You know on a regular basis you are
[SPEAKER_00]: applying the the pesticides whether or not
you're seeing any problems you or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: always applying the pesticide in intervals
and so um, if you're mixing JDOM and KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: together You can't really be spraying for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a matter of preventative
measures and I'm only spraying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Bay laurel and other Pesticides
only when I have problems because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: take a JDOM approach to KNF There is a
clash in where those regular pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications are going to affect those the
beneficial biology That you're building in
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I had a direct talk to
young Sancho from JDOM about and so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: asking him about the connection of the two
Korean natural farming and JDOM and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a concern that he mentioned was
that the the application say sulfur things
[SPEAKER_00]: like some of those You know different
pesticides that you can make in JDOM can
[SPEAKER_00]: have an adverse effect like on your
beneficial biology, so So my approach
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing the two I need to learn about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I have yet to be I haven't even read the
JDOM book yet So I'm fascinated by what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so much to learn from you so let's
go just back to that real quick cuz I
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got cut off right when I was
trying to make a point about yeah about
[SPEAKER_00]: using the two so really um You can't take
like if you're doing Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming with IMO and lactic acid bacteria
and all these beneficials A regular
[SPEAKER_00]: application of like sulfur or even
something like Bay can really have an
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse effect on on that so Anyways,
I'll only use that for preventative
[SPEAKER_00]: measures And I'm not doing the regular
spray Because your Dom does the protocol
[SPEAKER_00]: for JDOM is your spring some of these
pesticides whether you're seeing any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems or not That's kind of the
difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did he have?
[SPEAKER_01]: To say when you were talking so was he
supportive of this kind of hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: using JDOM and Korean natural farming When
you had that conversation was that a
[SPEAKER_01]: supported?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know there's kind of been rumors
flying for a while and you know Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: Riesling talking to him about this but the
You know Cho Han Kyu and Cho Young Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: like combining their their practices into
into one I don't know if that'll ever
[SPEAKER_00]: happen or not, but Because the father took
a different approach and and so has the
[SPEAKER_00]: son and he's kind of You know and master
Cho says that JDOM is the future now so I
[SPEAKER_00]: did get some positive feedback when I
talked to Cho Young Sun about Mixing the
[SPEAKER_00]: two but that that was the biggest Concern
that he had was that you know using using
[SPEAKER_00]: the IMO and Lactic acid bacteria Along
with some of these Pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know those pesticides can have an
adverse effect on that So that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest concern that he brought up with
that but but you Yeah, he did seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: think like you know, I use JDOM microbial
solution in tandem with With IMO and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a protocol of how I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll apply JDOM microbial solution,
which is more of a facultative Slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: more anaerobic and I'll use that for that
deeper soil Horizon, you know where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no oxygen and that really helps to
break up hard soils clay rock Whereas then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back, you know with with IMO and
apply that just for the topsoil Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm I'm the kind of the same way
because I've got hard clays too and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: finding are you finding this to be true
like Brit once I started bringing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: facultatives through the clip it seemed to
support the fungal growth from The more
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobic like they seem to be it seemed to
give this kind of foundational support and
[SPEAKER_01]: I got much like more vigorous growth From
the fungi that I was getting from my my
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO piles then before so I feel like
There's some function that's allowing them
[SPEAKER_01]: to be extremely Cooperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree and I'm seeing similar results You
know using the of the JMS it could could
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do with you know The JMS going in
doing the job first of breaking apart
[SPEAKER_00]: clay, you know micronizing down some of
that into Available minerals and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: IMOs are feeding on that Yeah,
so I you know and this to me is just it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it shouldn't be this battle of You
know aerobic versus anaerobic and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, they're they're both necessary in
nature There's no discrimination between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have roles within nature So
within the farm within our gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: they both have a role as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I so agree and Is the is the tricky
part but but it's doable yeah That's
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful and I also feel like some way
like there's I can't believe how much food
[SPEAKER_01]: this Provides for for like let's say
earthworms and earthworms eat fungi like
[SPEAKER_01]: left on their own They're gonna eat all
the fungal growth that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe also a function of this This
breakdown of our clays into food are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually just like we're starving And our
world is starving through this kind of You
[SPEAKER_01]: know disruption that maybe the
facultatives are giving these Insects the
[SPEAKER_01]: food that they need to kind of let the
fungi do what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's even just as simple as that
Yeah We need to re micro re mineralized,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not only ourselves but our
insect world as well Right Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're working with the clay is doing
doing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great Yeah, so how fun man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so let's take this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess even though I don't want to say
goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Know I'd love to talk all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I it was tough for me even to
get away I got to go help put in some drip
[SPEAKER_00]: line on our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah The time you took yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you having me on and sharing
and You know, I just want to say much love
[SPEAKER_00]: to everybody out there the natural farming
community and You know happy solstice to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody happy summertime Yeah,
yeah and get out there and do something
[SPEAKER_01]: guys this makes whatever it is Take this
information and if you've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: something new apply it Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and remember to be Reverend and
respectful with your with your wild
[SPEAKER_01]: crafting beautiful message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everybody Thanks for joining
and we'll make sure that this gets shared
[SPEAKER_01]: on all platforms and Please do go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my store listed online go and
purchase some balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only six piece six bucks a piece
This is going to be offered soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Bokashi now You
