[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about environmental
control and how it controls or impacts the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth or the quality of the plant,
we're talking about managing and
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the environmental parameters
that are important to how a plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with regard to light, plants respond to
light in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is through growth, which is biomass
accumulation and weight and yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other is through morphology,
photomorphological effects, meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: the spectrum of light or the type of light
you're providing to the plants influences
[SPEAKER_00]: the size and the shape of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those two things can be
complementary to each other with regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: yield overall as well as quality,
but sometimes they're not complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I like to analyze that or make
an analogy about that is to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I have conversations with
growers, I always tend to lean toward a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about what a plant is,
a plant is really a factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's receiving energy in the form of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's converting that light energy into
chemical energy through the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through a lot of other downstream
metabolic processes, it is creating the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that make up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are the structural
molecules, the stems and the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are the other chemical molecules
that we grow cannabis plants for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about it from an
economic perspective, as the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: using carbon that it's absorbing out of
the air through these processes of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different metabolic processes of fixing
that carbon, that carbon can either be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into a stem, a root, a leaf cell,
or it can be turned into a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule, or it can be turned into a
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two things could be competing
with each other in terms of the economics
[SPEAKER_00]: of carbon in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about the cannabis plant and its
relationship with light at different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of people who advocate
manipulating the spectral environment over
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis crops to try to elicit
various responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very challenging to measure and
quantify that because of the variability
[SPEAKER_00]: of not only the genetics of the plant,
but the environment that they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in, as well as the analytics it takes to
measure those types of responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it very difficult to verify
and validate that those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental influences on the plant are
causing the results that they are intended
[SPEAKER_00]: to result in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those types of spectral
manipulations are to modify the spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for different phases of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe part of it is a legacy issue
where people have grown different phases
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant growth under different types
of lights, which have different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would advocate for a blue-rich
environment in the veg phase, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: come from a fluorescent light,
or a metal halide light, versus the less
[SPEAKER_00]: blue-rich spectrum for flowering,
such as you'd get in a high-pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium light.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that a lot of people don't
realize is that all of the electric
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting technologies, including LED
technology, were never developed for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were only developed for human
lighting applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happens that humans and plants
see the same wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say see, I mean they both are
sensitive to the same wavelength range of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, but they see that light very
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humans use that wavelength range of
light for visual purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants use it for energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their energy source for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so plants absorb all wavelengths of
light in that same range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all wavelengths of light are useful to
the plant in driving photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I always hear like 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about is there any
research into the light outside that
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, like zero to 400 and 700 plus?
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants use the wavelength ranges
between 400 nanometers and 700 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's essentially what humans can see
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants also absorb light outside of
those ranges, and typically that light,
[SPEAKER_00]: those wavelengths of light, are used for
signaling in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the lower end of the
photosynthetically active radiation range,
[SPEAKER_00]: below 400 nanometers, which is in the near
UV to UV range, that can have certain
[SPEAKER_00]: responses on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's an environmental stress
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can respond to that in a way that
would protect themselves from that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant's saying this is not normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something wrong is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to protect myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe have a thicker layer on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily that they would
perceive it as not normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they would perceive it as is it's
an environmental influence that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has a response to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they're exposed to that
environmental influence, meaning a UV
[SPEAKER_00]: photon, then it has a response to that UV
photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are amazing living things because
they can't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to endure a very wide range
of environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, they've evolved many
different ways to deal with those
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of environmental
influences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a plant were growing at very high
elevation and exposed to a lot of UV,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would produce chemicals that would
protect them from UV damage to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like we put on sunscreen when you go
to the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants create their own sunscreen when
they're exposed to UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's in the form of
molecules that can be similar to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not the same as, the types of compounds
we're growing cannabis plants for to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, so sometimes the end result could be
a good, a desired result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about the carbon
economy of the plant, if the plant has to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on a thicker layer of wax on the
leaves to protect itself from UV
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, that's carbon that goes into
that protective layer that's not being
[SPEAKER_00]: used to make cannabinoids or terpenes,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the other end?
[SPEAKER_01]: So above 700, what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So above 700 nanometers is far-red
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does also have an influence on
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be given a lot more importance
in the cannabis culture, in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation than it really deserves
because far-red light is associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome responses in plants and that's
associated with flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people would like to correlate
far-red light with flowering cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants when the reality is it's the
photoperiod of light that's triggering
[SPEAKER_00]: that reproductive, they're triggering that
reproductive response in the plant through
[SPEAKER_00]: the photoperiod and not necessarily
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the real world, meaning an outdoor
environment, is there more red light in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fall than, let's say, like is there
more blue light in the spring and red
[SPEAKER_01]: light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I understand that people have
these perceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it kind of coming from what they're
seeing visually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is seasonal differences in the
spectrum, but it really is very minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically where you see the changes in the
spectrum in the sunlight is at sunrise and
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset or dusk and dawn because of the
angle of the sun and its penetration of
[SPEAKER_00]: light through the atmosphere changes the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority of photons the plants
receive are during the day and that
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum doesn't change much at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the past 10 years of light
science research, as it relates to plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: what were some of the most, like in your
mind, most groundbreaking discoveries in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of like, aha, we've discovered what
this does to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that's pretty relevant to this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, people were using LEDs to grow
plants and people have been growing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for at least 25 years using LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I first started my research at
NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on using wavelengths of light
that matched the absorption profile of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll A and B, which means it was
blue and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixing blue and red LEDs together was
producing a spectrum that was absorbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is that those
measurements or at least that absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: profile for chlorophyll was from isolated
chlorophyll out of leaves and measured in
[SPEAKER_00]: a test tube and a spectrophotometer that
produced a graph that showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll A and B absorbed light in the
blue and red range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that led people to think that plants
only need red and blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that today, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's led to a lot of technology
development for LEDs specifically with red
[SPEAKER_00]: and blue LEDs and the combination of the
two is a purple spectrum, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: superior to a broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any way, but it still works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will grow plants as long as the light
levels are maintained at the same as the
[SPEAKER_00]: broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would expect the same types of yield
and same types of responses from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a human factor issue
associated with the purple spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to detect problems
with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your responsibility is to make sure
your production facility is running well
[SPEAKER_00]: and you need to look for powdery mills or
mildew or insects or nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies, it's very difficult to see
those under a purple spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the broad spectrum, not only...
Literally when you open those doors and
[SPEAKER_01]: walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the broad spectrum provides a superior
spectrum, not only for the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also for the people that are working
in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have like the spot level of light,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have like the accumulation
over a period of a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about what each of those
are called and then like how much sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: at one point in time during the plants
various growth stages you want and then
[SPEAKER_01]: what the overall for like a day is that
you'd want?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about light measurement or
light levels on the canopy, we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about an instantaneous measurement of
light and that's used with a quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor and it measures light between 400
and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't distinguish between any of the
different wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just tells you how much light that
plants absorb are hitting your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an instantaneous measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another very important
measurement for light and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulated light dose that the plants
received and that's term called daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light integral or DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is basically the instantaneous
measurement of light times time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gives you a daily amount or a
daily dose of light that the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very important because when
you're talking about a photoperiodic plant
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannabis that flowers under short
days and stays vegetative under long days,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very important to manage those types
of instantaneous light levels and the
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of time that they're receiving in
order to maintain a healthy plant under
[SPEAKER_00]: those different reproductive stages of
growth and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given that, what are some of the things
you've seen when you walk into a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: operation where they're either giving way
too much or too little and what the effect
[SPEAKER_01]: is on the plants growth and health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well what I will address though is how you
can use DLI to solve or mitigate some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the problems people have going from
vegetation to flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're focusing on DLI as a
measurement or as a parameter of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, you can have a similar DLI in
veg that you do in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does has a very practical
implication because it allows you to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate the light stress that a lot of
growers observe when they go from veg to
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they veg under very low light levels,
then they have a lower DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they move those plants into the
flowering phase and they have a much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher instantaneous light level under a
shorter photoperiod, the overall doses of
[SPEAKER_00]: light that the plants receive is much
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the plants have to acclimate to
that higher amount of light they're
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving and the immediate response that
the plants have is they observe a stress
[SPEAKER_00]: response to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much light, the plants cannot
handle that much light and when the new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth is produced, it is then acclimated
to those higher levels of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers often have to dim the lights or
turn some of their lights off or raise the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to mitigate that light stress
during that transition period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you manage DLI, it's feasible to
mitigate that light stress period by
[SPEAKER_00]: having similar DLIs between your veg phase
and your flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you
