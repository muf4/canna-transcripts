[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that I've really noticed
about this industry is moving from kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: the shadows into the corporate world is
not an easy walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of you have difficulty in really
understanding the kind of regulations,
[SPEAKER_04]: the laws that you are now bound by because
it's legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations and I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know when I talk to the owner of a
cannabis company and I say you can't call
[SPEAKER_04]: every single one of your employees
contractors or you can't give everyone a
[SPEAKER_04]: salary and call it a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't do that anymore because of
wage and hour laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a little pushback and what I hear
most is well that's the way I've always
[SPEAKER_04]: done it and I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally understand and really it's my job
to help you understand to very gently help
[SPEAKER_04]: you understand why now that you are legal
you're in a legal industry you really have
[SPEAKER_04]: to start paying attention to some of this
stuff and it's not it's not interesting it
[SPEAKER_04]: is not sexy it's not fun it's it's the law
and we'll have Rocco go into that into
[SPEAKER_04]: more detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really my purpose in helping out the
cannabis industry is to really look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: little guy the up-and-comer that has a
small company has you know maybe a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: three ten employees and we need to get you
poised to really to grow and to grow in a
[SPEAKER_04]: way that you're going to be protected
because there's a lot of little nuances
[SPEAKER_04]: out there that you have to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know now you're looking at wage and
hour laws now you're looking at you know
[SPEAKER_04]: employee versus consultant you're looking
at a lot of things now that you didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have to look at before.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm not physically making you
money but in the long run we save you
[SPEAKER_04]: money you know by making sure that you're
compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a labor and employment lawyer by trade
and I'm geeking out in sort of a nerdy way
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is an event like this happening
in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to cannabis through labor and
employment law with a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional clients outside cannabis
saying hey somebody just came to work and
[SPEAKER_00]: they tested positive for cannabis I heard
it's legal in California can we still
[SPEAKER_00]: screen them out from employment
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our clients were doing business
with the cannabis industry selling them
[SPEAKER_00]: bags or glass or other materials and
saying how do we how do we work with this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming into it several years ago and
then launching a cannabis practice group
[SPEAKER_00]: and being really focused on the front end
with regulatory reforms and licensing and
[SPEAKER_00]: whispering in people's ears for the last
five years hey you probably should pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to labor and employment law at
some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting that we're actually there
and people are getting past the licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: point and now starting to look at these
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to being a labor and
employment lawyer and a partner in a firm
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Los Angeles I also serve as the HR
committee chair for the California
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Industry Association and if
there's anybody here who works in HR or
[SPEAKER_00]: who wears the HR hat for their
organization I would plead with you beg
[SPEAKER_00]: you please come see me so that we can get
you wrapped into that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very good people some very
sophisticated some very smart people on
[SPEAKER_00]: the committee but the thing that I have
trouble with is reaching out and getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of industry participants to come and
share sort of their headaches and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and as a as a CCIA chair we're
really trying to deliver information and
[SPEAKER_00]: practical advice to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can tell you what I think is
important but if it doesn't really land
[SPEAKER_00]: for you guys it's a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those discussions with the CCIA the
work that I'm being asked to do for
[SPEAKER_00]: clients inside the cannabis industry my
number one concern is as Lynn alluded to
[SPEAKER_00]: is the way people are paying people in
cannabis and I get why it happened it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: banking issue and people came out of a
cash-based system with with no ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: bank and a lot of cash sitting around and
it's just easier to start calling people
[SPEAKER_00]: paid volunteers which is sort of an
oxymoron or a contractor or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call them and pay them cash and
quite frankly a lot of times pay them very
[SPEAKER_00]: well in cash but no good deed goes
unpunished to businesses in a regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market and I will tell you without going
too deep in the weeds if you're not if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have employees that are working for you
people that are doing what it is you do as
[SPEAKER_00]: a business people that don't work for
companies outside of you those people are
[SPEAKER_00]: employees if you're not treating them as
employees if you're not calling them
[SPEAKER_00]: employees and if you're not paying them
the right way today it's okay but the
[SPEAKER_00]: statute of limitations on a wage and hour
claim is four years and it's not unheard
[SPEAKER_00]: of for us to settle class actions for wage
and hour liability and the millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars they will kill your business and
it's little things along the way in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the way that you classify them the way
that you track their hours if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're eligible for overtime wages the
way that you pay them those little things
[SPEAKER_00]: can be set up on the front end for you to
be successful in the long run and for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of you that think well Dean I can't
get a banking relationship or I have
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulty with the payroll solution I
will tell you that is an increasingly
[SPEAKER_00]: problem of the past so come find me come
find some of the other people that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: here we can help you solve that sort of a
problem so the wage and hour piece is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very very big problem for the industry I
see a receptiveness to changing but but we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get better there and the other
part beyond the way we pay people the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that companies are set up from an HR
standpoint in terms of onboarding people
[SPEAKER_00]: having policies and procedures dealing
with issues as they come up quite frankly
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of small cannabis companies were
started on a handshake with a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: friends who knew each other from past
business dealings the more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the more money you take in from
private investment the bigger you grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: more employees you're going to have that
no longer went to college with you that
[SPEAKER_00]: were no longer a referral from your
relatives and family members and if God
[SPEAKER_00]: forbid there's a downturn in the market
and you have to start laying some people
[SPEAKER_00]: off or firing them the tide will come out
and if you're not doing things right in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the way that you manage people as
employees talk to them about their
[SPEAKER_00]: performance issues when you go to fire
them if it's a surprise you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get wrongful termination discrimination
retaliation claims and so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: again very simple things that you can do
on the front end to build your HR function
[SPEAKER_00]: to have policies and procedures in place
to teach your managers how to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: people on performance issues that can
really manage a lot of that so those are
[SPEAKER_00]: really the two big things that I see on
the front end as we come out of licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody's cheerful that we got that
license that we've been struggling to get
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last year now that you go back to
running your business and trying to move
[SPEAKER_00]: at a profit those are the main two things
that I would encourage everybody in this
[SPEAKER_04]: room to focus on in the short term and I
would also like to add that through my
[SPEAKER_04]: years of experience one of the saddest
things that I've seen you know in in
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses just any kind of business is
the people that you're closest to building
[SPEAKER_04]: it are the people that sometimes you have
a really severe falling out with I've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: so many managers that have had one
employee and they're just the best best of
[SPEAKER_04]: friends and then something in the in the
business changes maybe financially you're
[SPEAKER_04]: having to make cutbacks maybe you're
having to decrease pay because financially
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just either decrease pay or lay
people off and I've seen really strong
[SPEAKER_04]: relationships go sour quickly and it's so
hurtful to everybody involved so in order
[SPEAKER_04]: to protect that it's it's really a good
thing to put policies and procedures in
[SPEAKER_04]: place and and the one the one word that I
encourage you to stay away from for your
[SPEAKER_04]: entire career is special it's a special
deal he's a special case that word will
[SPEAKER_04]: get you in more trouble because everyone
in the company will want to be special so
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really good to put policies and
procedures in place and I don't live and
[SPEAKER_04]: die by policies I don't care what policies
you put in place but once you put them
[SPEAKER_04]: there you know you really need to try and
adhere to them and it's really it's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: in the it's in the spirit of fairness to
your staff and you know if you're fair to
[SPEAKER_04]: your staff company-wide you kind of
alleviate a lot of issues throughout your
[SPEAKER_04]: entire you know experience in a company so
the one word you want to stay away from is
[SPEAKER_04]: special no special treatment no special
people those are the those are the issues
[SPEAKER_04]: that will you will see yourself in so many
meetings with other employees because you
[SPEAKER_04]: you treated somebody else better or you
know you can tell them don't tell how much
[SPEAKER_04]: you make they're gonna tell they're gonna
talk they're gonna tell so just try and be
[SPEAKER_04]: fair and equal to your staff and it will
it will actually help you in the long run
[SPEAKER_04]: so Karen is our next speaker and she's
going to talk about the requirements for
[SPEAKER_04]: food safety and the regulations and the
core principles thank you Lynn my name is
[SPEAKER_03]: Karen Clark and I'm the lead California
trainer for cannabis trainers and thank
[SPEAKER_03]: you Courtney for having us here tonight
and Peter so how many of you guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers of cannabis goods and how
many of you are dispensary owners the
[SPEAKER_03]: state requires that anybody that
manufactures cannabis products have to
[SPEAKER_03]: have has to have a ANSI certified food
safety program in place within 90 days for
[SPEAKER_03]: any one of their employees who is part of
the process of creating your cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: manufactured goods as of today in the
state of California we have certified
[SPEAKER_03]: approximately 11 manufacturers of cannabis
goods that number sucks so I know that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's at least 11 of you here and I've
only seen one person in this audience that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually given the surf safe
certification class to how many of you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys have there she is how many of you
guys have had your employees do the surf
[SPEAKER_03]: safe certification class oh come on so you
guys are talking about HR we have been
[SPEAKER_03]: providing these surf safe certification
classes for decades it's the traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: surf safe class we customize it come
completely for cannabis and it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional three and a half hour class
it's good for three years your employees
[SPEAKER_03]: can take that certification to any
manufacturing facility that they go to and
[SPEAKER_03]: we also have for the dispensary owners we
provide a class that is a similar to
[SPEAKER_03]: responsible alcohol program it's a
responsible vendor program and we teach
[SPEAKER_03]: your employees your managers and sometimes
owners of dispensaries in regards to the
[SPEAKER_03]: state regulations for safety checking IDs
security what the law is about selling
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis so we basically have a
responsible vendor program that helps you
[SPEAKER_03]: keep your employees trained at the state
level it does not require or say anything
[SPEAKER_03]: in specifics about what the training needs
to be but the local level is where the
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements are for a responsible vendor
program we actually have had several camps
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out to us because in their local
jurisdiction in their cannabis regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: at the local level they have a responsible
vendor program written into their local
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations that requires the employees to
be trained at a local level excuse me at a
[SPEAKER_03]: bartender level or even manager level
before that employee starts working on the
[SPEAKER_03]: floor so we have had those counties reach
out to us we've provided them our
[SPEAKER_03]: curriculum they've approved it and we have
gone all the way out to Mono County and
[SPEAKER_03]: Mammoth Mountain and done responsible
vendor programs to two of the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_03]: out there there's several more of them
that are coming on board the reason why
[SPEAKER_03]: training your employees is of value is
that it creates a retention for you as an
[SPEAKER_03]: employer so if you train your employees
and they know what's expected of them
[SPEAKER_03]: they're more than likely to stay you have
provided camp key performance indicators
[SPEAKER_03]: for them to know what's expected of them
when they arrive at work and also what the
[SPEAKER_03]: law is what the regulations are and what
the requirements are for what they need to
[SPEAKER_03]: do to do their job like I said at the
serve safe requirement for the food safety
[SPEAKER_03]: class that's a requirement of the
California Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_03]: you have 90 days to have your employees
trained in that serve safe certification
[SPEAKER_03]: and when the regulators walk in to do a
certification of your facility and they
[SPEAKER_03]: give you a pass at the Department of
Public Health level and they see a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of serve safe certifications all
over your kitchen they smile because they
[SPEAKER_03]: know that this this manufacturer has taken
the necessary steps to certify their
[SPEAKER_03]: employees for food safety I mean I've
walked into some food safety and to some
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers and there's been barrels of
acetone with no lids on them in the
[SPEAKER_03]: kitchen and I'm like what are you guys
doing you can't have this in your kitchen
[SPEAKER_03]: this is like completely prohibitive and
they're like what I'm like what right back
[SPEAKER_03]: get it out you can't have this in your
kitchen so her question was it does an
[SPEAKER_03]: individual have to be part of a company or
a manufacturer of cannabis goods to take
[SPEAKER_03]: the serve safe certification class and the
answer is no they do not have to be part
[SPEAKER_03]: of a manufacturer a cannabis manufacturer
they can come take the class anytime my
[SPEAKER_02]: name is Jacqueline Jutton I'm a researcher
with UFCW local 770 we're a labor union
[SPEAKER_02]: that represents retail and food workers
along with pharmacists in LA County
[SPEAKER_02]: Ventura County Santa Barbara and San Luis
Obispo County we've been fighting for
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana legalization since 2011 so we've
been very invested in this fight we do
[SPEAKER_02]: currently represent cannabis workers and I
think I imagine a lot of people want to
[SPEAKER_02]: know about the LPA requirement is that
what you're about to ask as you probably
[SPEAKER_02]: all know you have to have a signed labor
peace agreement with a bona fide labor
[SPEAKER_02]: union in order to get your your annual
license what that means is you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: sign an agreement preferably with us to
UFCW that says that in the event that we
[SPEAKER_02]: organize your facility you have to remain
neutral you can't talk bad about the union
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't you know managers can't try to
influence votes in exchange we won't
[SPEAKER_02]: strike we won't boycott we won't interrupt
your business this is a requirement for
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone in the city of Los Angeles who has
10 or more employees and in the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: California it's 20 or more and San
Francisco is also 10 or more I doubt
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone's here from there though oh okay
well there you go so so this signing this
[SPEAKER_02]: labor peace agreement does not say that
we're gonna come into your facility the
[SPEAKER_02]: next week or the next day to organize your
workers it states you know this is an
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement that lasts three years I believe
and so you know we we have a team of about
[SPEAKER_02]: six that's not enough to go in and
organize every every dispensary or
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer even this year really you
know our goal is to have a strong union
[SPEAKER_02]: workforce in cannabis from seed to retail
location to set you know good wages to set
[SPEAKER_02]: the standard you know to make sure that
the people that are doing the work in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry are taken cared for are you know
that no one's violating labor law which
[SPEAKER_02]: you know there's hopefully there's other
people that are involved that are trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that doesn't happen and
essentially just to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: workers who in a lot of ways have been
with this industry for years you know
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to can grow in it and continue to
feel that it's a it's an industry where
[SPEAKER_02]: you can raise a family you can have a
dependable paycheck that you can you know
[SPEAKER_02]: get paid by a payroll company that if you
do get laid off you can collect
[SPEAKER_02]: unemployment just you know things like
that to make sure that there is a standard
[SPEAKER_02]: in the industry so that that's kind of the
basis for it I think a lot of you are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably I don't know if anyone's applying
in phase two in LA but that would be you
[SPEAKER_02]: would have to you know either sign that
labor peace agreement before submitting
[SPEAKER_02]: your application or essentially make a
promise to sign one if you know your
[SPEAKER_04]: business isn't up and running yet I just
want to maybe have Dean touch on the
[SPEAKER_04]: ability now to get a bank account to to
pay your taxes to pay your employees
[SPEAKER_04]: through a payroll company and you said
that there's been a lot of strides in
[SPEAKER_04]: making it more accessible to the cannabis
industry can you talk about that a little
[SPEAKER_01]: please oh I'm sorry you
[SPEAKER_01]: can make yeah you have to sign a labor
peace agreement with a union we've you
[SPEAKER_02]: know been fighting for legal they were the
only union that's been fighting for
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization it makes the most sense we
already represent workers you know we have
[SPEAKER_02]: no union is dedicated a team to cannabis
like us we think it makes the most sense
[SPEAKER_02]: not just you know for us but for for you
for the workers I mean so but yes you
[SPEAKER_02]: could choose any union you want it's about
a six page agreement that states you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it lists out particulars if we send a
letter of intent to organize for example
[SPEAKER_02]: you would have to send us an employee list
within 10 days it states that you know if
[SPEAKER_02]: we if we it basically it outlines what
happens if we if we submit an intent to
[SPEAKER_02]: organize so it just lays out that process
it lays out you know within how many days
[SPEAKER_02]: we you you know both the company and the
union has to provide each other with
[SPEAKER_02]: certain information it just it's really
and and normally we don't have to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: even refer to the labor peace agreement we
have good relationships with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: business owners we've been working
alongside each other so this is really in
[SPEAKER_02]: the case that things you know get really
ugly but it's really just kind of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: common-sense things that we would get you
know an hour of time to talk to the
[SPEAKER_02]: employees about the union at some point so
just you know some particulars like that
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm happy to forward an example of the
labor peace agreement to anyone to any
[SPEAKER_02]: business owners who are interested come
talk to me at the break and I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_02]: share information and share the share the
agreement just to piggyback off that so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a member of CCIA you can reach out
to the CCIA's HR committee and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: model agreement that CCA's board has sort
of blessed and we can talk with you about
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are certain just to answer your
original question there are certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: that the law says have to be considered
and a number of other things that are sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of open to negotiation between the union
and the cannabis business so but yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: there are some forms floating around it so
the question is whether our goal is to is
[SPEAKER_02]: to organize all the workers in the
industry or just essentially workers who
[SPEAKER_02]: need it the most who have been victim of
labor law violations we would like to
[SPEAKER_02]: organize the whole industry we want to set
the standards we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: every workers you know getting paid more
than minimum wage getting paid overtime
[SPEAKER_02]: you know doesn't have to do with sexual
harassment you know eventually you know
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to sign the labor peace if you
have ten or more but if you have fewer
[SPEAKER_02]: workers that doesn't mean that you're you
weren't ever going to try to organize your
[SPEAKER_02]: shop it just means that process won't be
we won't have you know we won't be bound
[SPEAKER_02]: by the process of the LPA but you know
it's our I mean that's you know labor
[SPEAKER_02]: unions as a goal that's you know that's
what they they're looking to to organize
[SPEAKER_02]: an industry to make sure that there aren't
certain bad actors who get away with
[SPEAKER_02]: taking advantage of their workers and you
know it's really to set a floor for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone and again just to sort of echo
that I think if you are sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and you're worried about being
unionized or you're not sure about it the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest way to get unionized is to not pay
your employees the right way have
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous working conditions don't carry
workers comp have somebody get injured at
[SPEAKER_00]: work it's very easy for a union to come in
and address all the things that she just
[SPEAKER_00]: laid out to say they're not taking care of
it so we'll take care of it for you as an
[SPEAKER_00]: employee group so that there is a doubt
there's definitely a balance real quickly
[SPEAKER_04]: if you could just touch on the banking and
payroll and taxes yeah so one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that the federal government has
kept in place notwithstanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: revocation of the coal memo is the
Department of Treasury is still requiring
[SPEAKER_00]: banks who bank cannabis money to file
marijuana limited suspicious activity
[SPEAKER_00]: reports and they're actually encouraging
banks to bank it so that there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: certainty and people aren't sort of hiding
loads of cash under mattresses if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: that the defense in department that is
involved in receiving and outlining what
[SPEAKER_00]: those reports look like publishes
statistics on how many banking
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions are actually filing marijuana
suspicious activity reports and contrary
[SPEAKER_00]: to the news that you're hearing that
nobody's banking marijuana hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: banks are filing suspicious activity
reports right now so the banking is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and even if you can't go into
your current bank there are probably other
[SPEAKER_00]: banks that if you're out in the open about
it and you tell them what you're doing I
[SPEAKER_00]: know for example with the unions if that's
a solution and a partnership that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make some of the unions will allow you
to use the unions banking facilities to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the payroll for their unionized employees
so there's a lot of solutions that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there my without endorsing any single one
of them my message to everyone in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room is just go find one so that you
understand if you're not paying you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pay people cash by the way and still give
them a pay step it's complicated as hell
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a pain in the ass and you'll probably
go through an HR director every three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks because they're having to do payroll
and killing themselves over it okay shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: she's for hire she's right but you can
still do that at least give them a pay
[SPEAKER_00]: step but if you set up a payroll
relationship it will give you the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to track people's hours and then pay
people based on the hours that they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually work and if they work over eight
in a day or work over 40 in a week your
[SPEAKER_00]: payroll system will be set up in a way
that will automatically calculate the
[SPEAKER_00]: overtime hours and all of the deductions
and state payroll taxes will be set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll go through that process all of that
is going to give you documentation of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing you'll be able to show that
you're paying your employees the right way
[SPEAKER_00]: and so if people leave and they're jaded
or they're upset with you and they go to
[SPEAKER_00]: see a labor attorney or they go downtown
to Los Angeles and they file a claim with
[SPEAKER_00]: the DLSE and they go in and talk to an
agent and the agent's first question is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be let me see your payroll
records and if you're doing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: basic things this is not complicated stuff
if you're doing some of those basic things
[SPEAKER_00]: the DLSE is not going to take that claim
that plaintiff lawyer down the street is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tell them it looks like they're
doing things right but if they walk into
[SPEAKER_00]: the DLSE or they walk into a lawyer's
office and they say well they pay me in
[SPEAKER_00]: cash and I don't get a pay stop and they
don't record the hours that I work that
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyer is going to start drooling and
you're going to see a multi plaintiff case
[SPEAKER_00]: land on your doorstep and they're going to
say pay up or we're going to take you to
[SPEAKER_00]: court and put this out to the public maybe
expose your business that maybe is not
[SPEAKER_00]: fully licensed yet to government scrutiny
I'm a lawyer but I can I guess that means
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell bad lawyer jokes lawyers are
not very nice people sometimes and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: not by the way always for the benefit of
your employees it's for those lawyers to
[SPEAKER_00]: get lawyers fees out of it right they're
trying to collect money from what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying them so if you give them a
low-hanging fruit piece of a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit case where they can just go this is
a slam dunk winner they're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: you and they're going to exert they're
going to exert maximum settlement out so
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the sort of things that a
banking relationship a payroll
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship just naturally will blossom
those those sort of compliance issues
[SPEAKER_03]: another thing to take that just a little
bit further is forget about the lawsuit
[SPEAKER_03]: that the employee is going to put on you
but the state of California payroll tax is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to come after you and the state of
California when you are not paying payroll
[SPEAKER_03]: taxes on your employee they look at that
as you're stealing money not just from the
[SPEAKER_03]: state of California but also the employee
and they're far more ruthless than the IRS
[SPEAKER_03]: in the state of California if you owe them
money from the federal government or the
[SPEAKER_03]: state so not paying your employees
appropriately not just gets you in trouble
[SPEAKER_03]: with a lawsuit from your employee but the
state of California is going to definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: come after you for that I've spoken with
several of them some of that some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: EDD officers and they sit in the they used
to sit in the parking lots of dispensaries
[SPEAKER_03]: and count how many people walk in go in as
a patient count how many employees there
[SPEAKER_03]: are go back to their office look up the
address and see how much payroll tax has
[SPEAKER_03]: been paid and file right then so this is a
this is not a joke this is something
[SPEAKER_03]: that's very serious and I know all about
that stuff so please you know take this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff very seriously yeah and just again
piggyback off of that I've sat in so many
[SPEAKER_04]: conference rooms across attorneys like him
and he's going to ask for every document
[SPEAKER_04]: every the first thing he's going to ask
for is your handbook the next thing he's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to ask you for is your payroll
records so you know even though it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: pain in the butt and again it's not fun
it's something that you really as an
[SPEAKER_04]: employer need to have I've talked to
several of the very large payroll
[SPEAKER_04]: companies out there and asked them if they
would take on cannabis clients and they
[SPEAKER_04]: say yeah they're not really excited about
it yet they say they can take on a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis company as long as they don't
have a conspicuous name so it has to be
[SPEAKER_04]: something that has nothing to do with
cannabis itself which I don't know how
[SPEAKER_04]: they determine that but I know that there
is one company and if you ever want to get
[SPEAKER_04]: in touch with me that that does handle
cannabis industry but it really is better
[SPEAKER_04]: to to to just get this taken care of get
somebody in who knows how to do it knows
[SPEAKER_04]: how to handle it and just get it taken
care of I promise you in the long run when
[SPEAKER_04]: you do get sued because these employees
have just as much access to the law as we
[SPEAKER_04]: do now and they research and if you make a
man they're going to start coming at you
[SPEAKER_04]: so you want to protect your self you you
you you
