[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to support the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the consumer is the person in the
room that legitimately is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: marginalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into a store just to buy an
eighth of cannabis, it is upwards of $90.
[SPEAKER_00]: $90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is taxed at 30% to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the highest tax commodities
that there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And higher than cigarettes and alcohol,
which kill you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That this is legitimately medicine for
some people that they cannot get and they
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vicodin and opiates, they're $5.14 when
you go to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your medication is $5.14 and you'd
rather get off of it and get onto
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but your insurance company won't
cover it, and it's $90 for an eighth,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's $100 to get CBD, like cannabis CBD,
18 to one pills are $90.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a count of less than 60, it's
incorrigible that the industry is out for
[SPEAKER_00]: this $125 million payday that we're
bringing in capital and we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: screaming from the rooftops that the taxes
are too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is nobody to sell it to if
they cannot afford to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you are not spending as much
time supporting these legislative efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you will have no market share to
speak of because nobody will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find my medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have clients that I'm able to procure
product from, but that's not everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not just talking about medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical market is truly suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the recreational market,
if the adult use market can't afford to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay, then the entire system collapses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sometimes gets cast in a way where
we're, because medical is so important and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's suffering more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to understand that if you have
no customers, the rest of the supply chain
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have operators that will say,
or I've heard operators say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not really my problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: My problem is running my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have a resurgence of the
illicit market if we are not careful in
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting the taxation issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just fun little facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a city charges you a tax to operate,
that is not then a tax that you will
[SPEAKER_00]: assess to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your tax to operate your business
that allows you to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a real important issue that
when CDTFA comes and starts doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: audits, it is actually not lawful to pass
on that tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you write a receipt, and I have
seen this happen, there is a sales and use
[SPEAKER_00]: tax, the excise tax that somehow is
applied at the retailer, which it's
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to already be in the cost of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got sales and use tax,
excise tax, an additional city tax,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the final cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last item, that last like,
oh, they charged me 5% gross sales
[SPEAKER_00]: receipts tax, that's your company's tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the consumer tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be forewarned, we're going to see lawsuits
surrounding that, either from the public
[SPEAKER_00]: to those operators or fines from CDTFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
