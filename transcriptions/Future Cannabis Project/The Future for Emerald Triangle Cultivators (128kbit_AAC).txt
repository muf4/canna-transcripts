[SPEAKER_01]: If Sacramento got their act together,
the BCC, what do you see could be the
[SPEAKER_01]: future in the next five to 10 years in
Humboldt County and the Emerald Triangle?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a perfect world, if things got better,
if somehow they started getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory act improved and making it work
for farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, and I believe that it will
work over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't see any future, I wouldn't
have went so hard at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see this little bump,
but I still have the same long-term view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what you're going to see
is a radical change in stores just like
[SPEAKER_00]: retail in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So retail in general is no more
storefronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love to buy things online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love the simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't like to deal with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people tell me that, I go,
well, go tell that to block Buster and
[SPEAKER_00]: explain to me how much they love going in
and buying CDs and DVDs to watch their
[SPEAKER_00]: movies because they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rather have it delivered right
through the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis will be the same way where I
think that the delivery model will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: model of the future by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And storefronts will only be like
flagships, the places that you can come to
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It represents a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in geographic areas that have huge
traffic flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise you're done because it
mirrors all retail sales in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we start to have the distribution
and delivery that is really well organized
[SPEAKER_00]: through California, then what you'd be
able to have is companies that specialize
[SPEAKER_00]: in working with Humboldt County products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we go forward, you're going to have
very differentiated genetics in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: it's stamped as it's owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then those companies might have
those forms that they want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that Sunkist doesn't let you just
grow whatever orange you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you the orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell you what orange they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in tobacco, you're controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in wine, you're in champagne,
you're growing a very four different type
[SPEAKER_00]: of grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each region to me would produce
things that were distinctive to this
[SPEAKER_00]: region, that shined in the region,
that let the cultivators produce common
[SPEAKER_00]: products so that you had the ability to
have enough product from Humboldt move
[SPEAKER_00]: across the whole state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually over throughout the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in a level that gave them the ability to
buy it over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you then would have is you'd have
cultivators that then would have little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny niche gardens on their bigger picture
farm that would then let them release a
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonal kind of like breweries do a
seasonal beer release where they,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we only brew this lambic once a year
because it's expensive to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: We charge more, but we make less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that will follow suit
because it does with all the these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabis is no longer held by us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll follow like every other product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for us, we just have to
understand those changes are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur whether we like it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that what we need to do is build the
farms, build the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County produces world class
cannabis, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate's too good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is ideal for really good herb
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get it in the Central Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get it in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run indoor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run indoor in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run indoor in the Central
Valley where there's the contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to run indoor on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run indoor in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run indoor in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run outdoor through all these
regions in this Northern California area
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way into the Sierra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the Sierra's north, it's some of
the best pot grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine until you get up into
like mid Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Southern Oregon, Northern
California cluster is probably some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best cannabis growing on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other countries, we talk about
these other countries, but they have
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity issues too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the things that grow there aren't
attractive to the customer anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time will switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be great for biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, for flour, for exquisite
smoke, these are the regions where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get those outdoor products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Humboldt just really has to come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing all these groups get
together to learn regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's getting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting together groups to do
combined buying for ag products so this
[SPEAKER_00]: way everybody can get a cheaper price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting people to come in and say,
hey, this is what I think would move
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm looking at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's no longer moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of holding that information,
you share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you share it with the clusters you're
in because you're all going to compete in
[SPEAKER_00]: a different little realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the positive part of
poverty is that it brings people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I've ever seen Humboldt
so united.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is killing me because we've never
been so broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are all trying hard to work
together to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of us intend to stay here for the
duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my goal is to die here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully not tomorrow, but when I'm
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see the farm that I built
produce the cannabis that I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see my kids be able to be
part of that industry in the future so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have something of value that
took a lot of work to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I'm no different than
anybody else I meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're on the same exact boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only difference is I have is I
have multiple licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the multiple licenses give me a
different perspective than most people
[SPEAKER_00]: because they see it from either one or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm seeing it from many at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just know that right now,
boy, you better be careful financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be wary.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
Thank you.
