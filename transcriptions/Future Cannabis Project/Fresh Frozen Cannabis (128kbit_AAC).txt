[SPEAKER_00]: one thing you know I talked about besides
you catching up with a few other growers
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning the law we're talking about
winterization and fresh frozen so how much
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you don't have to tell us exactly
how many pounds you're pushing yeah but
[SPEAKER_00]: even just a percentage if that's something
you're getting into and how much of it are
[SPEAKER_00]: you allocating to essentially for lack of
a better term diversify your portfolio
[SPEAKER_01]: totally so I mean we have 50,000 square
feet outdoor I would say this is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the first year that I'm actually
allocating a good amount of it to fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen just kind of seeing where the
markets evolved on the scale of production
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're at limitations on where we can
dry it so getting into that fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: which means we just take the plant fresh
bucket down clean it up a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze it right away straight to the
freezer straight to the freezer and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the extract artists these days are
that's where they get the most high-end
[SPEAKER_01]: product and that's ties in a live rosin
yes live rosin indoor live resins yeah the
[SPEAKER_01]: live rosin which is the organic kind of
bubble hash extraction and then pressing
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I'll get you the live rosin and
then the other side of it is the live
[SPEAKER_01]: resin which guys are pushing the fresh
frozen material through BHO and then and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just creates a different product yeah
altogether right totally different because
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually this year just as an experiment
gave the same crop same you know same
[SPEAKER_01]: everything same greenhouse to a BHO live
resin manufacturer and a live rosin and
[SPEAKER_01]: the product is so different if I didn't
know they were grown even the same strain
[SPEAKER_01]: really it's just such a difference in the
way it comes out and we might even see
[SPEAKER_01]: that amongst extractors as well just
because of different techniques so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of fun and cool it's just to see the
differences of like your raw material
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you dry the flower it's going
to be the dried flower the extract brings
[SPEAKER_01]: this whole other element to like kind of
an artist so yeah yeah I think a Frenchy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannoli I know he's really come up on the
scene lately and there's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals like him around the world but
it really is an art that's one thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: know as as crazy as Frenchy can be I love
that he really puts that emphasis that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is an art when he's doing bubble hash yeah
you know and it is a totally different
[SPEAKER_01]: experience from the and that's the only
thing it takes different infrastructure so
[SPEAKER_01]: you gotta have freezer rooms ways to
transport that and then what if a freezer
[SPEAKER_01]: goes down and you have 200 pounds of
material in there you got to have a backup
[SPEAKER_01]: in place like so there's a lot of think
it's a lot a lot to think about a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: moving parts I probably prefer I wish I
could just dry it all traditionally and
[SPEAKER_01]: and do that but it's fun to evolve with
the market and see new products come out
[SPEAKER_01]: and be a part of all that so it's got to
adapt and do a little bit everything so
[SPEAKER_01]: overall I'd say probably you know we focus
on trying to keep the tops of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for flower the best stuff of the best and
then focus on the lower and it also helps
[SPEAKER_01]: with the harvest timing so we can get all
those tops that are more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: mold or protritus get them hanging drying
gives us more time to deal with like the
[SPEAKER_01]: lower but still good quality you know as a
grower I always smoke the smalls I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: always better I love artichokes and I'm
like the biggest artichokes aren't always
[SPEAKER_00]: the most flavorful it's funny how that
transcends so many things or even like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah lobsters shrimp and there are so many
things it's your point quality over
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity right so it allows us to timeout
she says big hands you know either one I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like is that from a song yes it allows us
to timeout the harvest a little bit yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I'd say we're doing about 25% fresh
frozen this year pretty fair amount for a
[SPEAKER_01]: 50,000 square foot canopy yeah that's why
I got 420 square feet of freezer space
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out this week there are there are
supposedly some companies coming up that
[SPEAKER_01]: that are that are manufacturing companies
that rely on that brush frozen material I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't personally run into a company
that's sending troops up to do that work
[SPEAKER_01]: for us I am working with one of the the
biggest brands in the in the space right
[SPEAKER_01]: now in the industry and they're about to
launch if they haven't launched it yet a
[SPEAKER_00]: live rosin brand and I can guess who that
is I think they're based out of just just
[SPEAKER_01]: not too far from here actually they're
based in here in Humboldt yeah yeah and so
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna be one of their their main
three producers for their fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: line nice I mean I think it's probably
open knowledge they have an Instagram up
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think it's all good but poppin
Barclays is introducing a live rosin brand
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's gonna be poppa select you you you
