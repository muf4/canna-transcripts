[SPEAKER_00]: Quick, quick, quick historical overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts has had a medical use of
marijuana program since approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: really up and running say 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the medical program and the adult
program were put in place by ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any of you that reside in the state or
do business in the state, where a ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative is the process by which
regulation of cannabis may be coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass, please, please, please do your best
to advocate for reasonable timelines
[SPEAKER_00]: because in both the medical and the adult
use cannabis implementation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts, the legislators and the
regulators were given a very, very short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you very thoughtful people know,
that is not the best way to develop good
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a quick timeline for the adult
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a ballot initiative in November
of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature had to amend the law that
was put in place by the ballot petition
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were certain areas that were
in conflict with the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they were in there, they did
some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those other things was they
created the Energy and Environmental Work
[SPEAKER_00]: Group, which Alex sat on together with me
and some representatives from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Environmental Protection
and the Department of Agriculture in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we go forward through this
timeline, you'll see that the Energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Work Group was working to
try and get energy and efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: standards into place as we were
simultaneously building an independent
[SPEAKER_00]: agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, we don't sit in any other part of the
Massachusetts government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little balloon off to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had no existing infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also licensing to get licensees up and
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I'm sure those of
you who work in the cannabis environment
[SPEAKER_00]: know is nothing related to this industry
seems to go to plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something always goes sideways a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the examples of that is one of
our first two licensees to open and
[SPEAKER_00]: commence operations, November 20th,
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is often a variable, no matter how
much you plan for something, that throws
[SPEAKER_00]: off the result you're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it was that we had a
lovely central location for one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: licensees in a town called Leicester that
was very excited to have them open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had done very careful study of
their traffic plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited to have them be one of
our first licensees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the week of Thanksgiving in November
2018, we allowed them to go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not realizing that the access road they
were on was the only road to the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you saw the news coverage of that,
you can imagine how that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quick overview of the type of
licenses that we have in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of these are exactly what they
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sound like cultivation is exactly
what you would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craft cooperatives is a cooperative
structure for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro businesses are limited in size and
they get breaks on fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product manufacturing is exactly what it
sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail is the actual selling to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research hasn't really gotten off the
ground yet, but we're hoping to fill some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gaps that we're hearing from people
in various aspects of the industry where
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal government is not allowing
them to move forward with research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do what we can do, taking
advantage of the great access we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts to folks that have labs,
et cetera, as resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transporters are essentially a product of
the farming community telling us that
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators wanted to grow the plant,
but they didn't necessarily want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive it anywhere because it requires a
very secure, expensive vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we created a category where those
who were investing in those vehicles could
[SPEAKER_00]: monetize their fleet by leasing them out,
or you could have just a entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: independent transporting license where
that's all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't otherwise touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Independent testing labs are the labs that
assure us that what is in the cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually inconsistent with regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also just recently licensed
delivery and social consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social consumption is not likely to get
off the ground in Massachusetts anytime
[SPEAKER_00]: soon because there is a legislative hitch
that needs to be resolved before they can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually come to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you an idea of the framework
we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the difference between the
existing medical industry and the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical, when it was implemented in 2013,
is vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a medical licensee in
Massachusetts, you have all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delivery's optional, but you have
cultivation, product manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: retail, all under your corporate
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adult is more similar to mainstream
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose to do any one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the medical side, hot tip, we are going
to be going through a regulatory round in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that vertical integration may come
off, and medical may be similar to adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is of interest to you,
please stay tuned to the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: process in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll likely get going in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things in Massachusetts are not done,
not settled in terms of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still one more regulatory round to
go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our structure in terms of the
day-to-day life of applying and receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the application process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see highlighted there is
management operations profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm highlighting it for you
is that's where the energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental compliance is going to come
into play in a few slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you go through the application
process, you are granted a provisional
[SPEAKER_00]: license, or denied one, who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are granted one, the next step for
you is to file plans for an architectural
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make sure what you're building
out is actually compliant with our
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also have to go through local
permits and licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you see architectural review is
highlighted in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because that is where we're
going to be looking at your energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go through your final, which is
essentially you've gotten your certificate
[SPEAKER_00]: of occupancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get all the inspections necessary
to get to the next step, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: notice to commence operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that notice to commence
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that means in three days,
you could actually be operational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of energy and environmental
use there, we are going to have ongoing
[SPEAKER_00]: engagement with our compliance staff to
make sure that you are keeping up to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you promised to do in your management
operations profile and your architectural
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to renewal, which is annual
in Massachusetts, there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental reporting using,
and we'll get into this in a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, the cannabis power score.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you, Resource Innovation
Institute, for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as updating a compliance letter
that I'll talk about in more detail in a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is all back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about how we got to where we got
to, the initial regulations were published
[SPEAKER_00]: in March of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was where you first saw that 36
kilowatt standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a 50 kilowatt standard for
smaller operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the initial regulations were put in
place, and that was after quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: public comment, I might add, and a public
hearing, the working group convened and
[SPEAKER_00]: continued to have more public comment and
invite more written comment from
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholders and had multiple meetings of
the working group to discuss developing
[SPEAKER_00]: guidances and the best management
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we got to 2019, and this was the
first amendment regulatory round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were initially so rushed in
2017 and 2018, we told everybody that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to have to reopen the regs
again, and we ended up doing it twice,
[SPEAKER_00]: to address things that we just didn't have
time to deal with in the first regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: round.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed time to flesh out those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And energy and environment were one of the
things that got tackled in March of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published draft amended regulations,
which sort of elaborated on other
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance pathways for energy and
environmental issues, had public hearings,
[SPEAKER_00]: did a discussion of draft amended
regulations, and they finally went into
[SPEAKER_00]: place November 1st, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I go through all that is to say
that we didn't get a lot of public comment
[SPEAKER_00]: on the energy and environmental
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I'm hoping to get out
of this conference here today is pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you all know that we're
doing this, because you all have valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: insight and perspective that we,
especially this person who is a lawyer,
[SPEAKER_00]: not an energy and environmental person,
we need to get your input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't even know the regulatory
process is happening, we're not gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would like to do today is,
if you've looked at our regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've looked at our guidance documents
on the website, and you have questions
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's something that isn't quite
clear to you, give me those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably can't answer them today,
but what we are gonna do is publish a
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling FAQ on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes the questions from the
cultivators, from the engineers,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the consultants, and tries to give
you as much guidance as we can about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this to the best ability for you and
your clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regulations are one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guidance, how it works in
Massachusetts, the guidance interprets the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and tells you what the
regulators want to see in addition to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory language itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the best management practices are
literally that suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fear not those who are interested in
that water use issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to amend our water use
guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find out about the six gallon issue
and we are addressing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two methods of trying to
encourage compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leadership award essentially provides
an opportunity to be recognized for your
[SPEAKER_00]: excellence in your work, your clients
work, the licensees work, in achieving
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and environmental goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not just a pretty sticker on
your product or on your window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the bottom language.
[SPEAKER_00]: These leadership ratings are taken into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your client gets in trouble for who
knows, you know, something or another,
[SPEAKER_00]: improper waste disposal as an example,
we take the leadership rating into account
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're considering the fine that could
get levied or license action like
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension or revocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not toothless.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something clients want to
aspire to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is something that may get
tweaked in the 2020 regulatory updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So partly because it needs to be updated
to address one internal conflict,
[SPEAKER_00]: but partly because I'd like to have an
opportunity to invite all of you who are
[SPEAKER_00]: more familiar with how this should work to
give us some input.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were designing this yourself,
what would you put?
[SPEAKER_00]: So make your voice heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the stick for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went over this framework earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you submit an energy plan as part of
your management operations profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do not think is compliant,
what you're going to get is a request for
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone familiar with the Massachusetts
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slow in terms of licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were confined to a very small space for
a very long period of time and we couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: hire enough staff to keep up with the
volume of applications that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only just staffing up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want an RFI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get it right the first time
because an RFI can slow you down a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your client has carrying costs that
are significant because they're holding
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple properties, this is a significant
expenditure to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely try to get it as right as
you can the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same concept at the architectural review
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see something in the architectural
review that does not seem like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant, you could get a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of ongoing engagement,
our inspectors have the right to inspect
[SPEAKER_00]: your records any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could get a question if they see
something there they don't think is
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get to the renewal stage and we see
that you're not compliant and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be, you could get a condition
on your license saying, okay, now you've
[SPEAKER_00]: only got 60 days or there's going to be an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the option, obviously,
of non-renewal, cease and desist orders,
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension, fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing that you want to deal with,
nothing that your client wants to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the various regulatory themes
we had to deal with as we were developing
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to fly through the basic
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for everybody but cultivators
because this is really an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture conference and you don't
really need to focus on the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to get the information out
there in addition to what we have in our
[SPEAKER_00]: guidances posted online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, essentially the process here is
to get people engaged and try to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to really consider energy efficiency
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see this throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, renewables have you thought about
whether or not you can use renewables?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you examined your demand and what you
can do to reduce it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have you engaged in dealing with
the energy efficiency programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have MassSave in Massachusetts and
they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to the extent you can work with them,
please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transporters and delivery, they have a
different set of criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to deal with them
differently from other kind of license
[SPEAKER_00]: types and other kind of cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already talked about data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this again is more detailed on the
prior slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to get an energy plan that
shows that you're being thoughtful and
[SPEAKER_00]: really getting ready to operate in an
energy efficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be submitting as part
of the architectural review process an
[SPEAKER_00]: energy compliance letter or an energy
compliance exemption letter and a third
[SPEAKER_00]: party safety certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the folks that need to fill
out that letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most people it's going to be a
professional engineer, a registered
[SPEAKER_00]: architect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are two other options for the
smaller operators or someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrates there's a reason they need to
use someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one exception is the HVAC and
dehumidification requirements do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be done by a mechanical engineer or a
professional engineer with a license that
[SPEAKER_00]: covers mechanical engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's relatively straightforward
information that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it is literally demonstrating
compliance in a way that is relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for you, relatively easy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there doesn't need to be a lot of gray
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the things that are getting
the most questions now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we even saw questions on
social media where folks are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to each other about how to measure
compliance with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would also suggest that you make
sure those questions are coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: commission because we want to make sure
that the conversation is happening with
[SPEAKER_00]: us, not without us, because we're the ones
that will make the decision whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're submitting is compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some additional information in
regard to that with the HLPD requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is what came out of the 2019
amendments, which is our partnership with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Design Lights Consortium and their
ability to provide information to
[SPEAKER_00]: applicants and licensees about equipment
that will be deemed to be compliant as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as it meets their requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've built out a filter in their
software, which is much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it will be wonderful for
especially our smaller operators to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to determine compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's additional information regarding
that energy compliance letter and what
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be submitted with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, on the HVAC side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving forward to eye safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protection of the workers is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is becoming an emergency,
an emerging issue for regulators in case
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concern that cannabis workers are not
being adequately protected by the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hot tip from the regulator space,
pay attention to these issues because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you're gonna hear increasing volume
on them in the coming months and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy compliance exemption letter is
the one that talks about why you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be compliant with the HLPD or the
HQPL because you are generating 80% or
[SPEAKER_00]: more from a renewable generating source,
a renewable thermal generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here under, this is set by
Massachusetts law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what we'll expect to see in
that energy compliance exemption letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: On renewal, this is where the cannabis
power score comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to collect the data about
your energy consumption, your water
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, onsite energy generation and
cannabis yield by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to our partnership on the cannabis
power score and review that as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: renewal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're all familiar with the
cannabis power score software,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of the folks that are gonna be
coming into compliance have already gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through, they're already operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they haven't done the architectural
review process yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that applies to you or your client,
the renewal deadline becomes significant
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is the first time you're
gonna be supplying that energy compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: or energy compliance exemption letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't in operation yet,
you will do that as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: architectural review process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're already up and running,
this is the point where you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: submitting that in addition to providing
the cannabis power score report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the deadline for existing operators to
become compliant with all of this is July
[SPEAKER_00]: 1st, 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've provided an option for a further
six month extension for certain folks if
[SPEAKER_00]: they agree to complete a comprehensive
survey regarding their energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the report will be due on October 1st
and an update will be due on, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually January 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured out January 2nd is a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, no one has to do it on
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we are trying to do is address
the theme that we heard earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: More data needed, more data needed,
more data needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a different kind of baseline than
what Nick was referring to earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a very comprehensive,
I think 50 questions that goes into all
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, and again, this is a big
debate, what word to use, but we ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: using strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can yell at me at dinner,
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of really nerdy,
weedy details that we think are important
[SPEAKER_00]: to gather and that we intend ultimately to
publish on, goodness me.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 would be hilarious, but no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll make that suggestion,
how about that, 420, 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we intend to publish that on our open
data platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not familiar with our open
data platform, Massachusetts is really
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated to getting data and research out
there for government agencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: for consultants, for whoever to use,
for academics to use, because we can
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously gather a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in this great position of being able
to gather all of this information,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't want to hoard it and keep it
to ourselves because it's important for
[SPEAKER_00]: the states that are coming online,
the countries that are coming online,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have some idea of what they're getting
themselves into and what is going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this industry legalizing in their
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make this information as
available as we possibly can, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: will include the survey information that
we get off the energy extension report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bottom line, and the things that I want
you to take away from this are,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, let's find a way to better engage
with each other because I want to hear a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more information coming to the
regulators in the 2020 round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would encourage you not only to
engage with Massachusetts, but we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know, we have other states coming
online, and you have an opportunity to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in on the ground floor in all these states
that are considering legalizing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing it in an energy-responsible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way they're going to be able
to do that sensibly and in a way that's
[SPEAKER_00]: data-driven is if they hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start with me and tell me all
the questions you have about Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can take it back to my team and then
throw it up on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would also encourage you to do that
with other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's face it, we've got federal
officials that are probably looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: this and trying to figure out,
going down the road, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens with the election, what we're
going to do on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make sure that they're
informed about how to do this in an
[SPEAKER_00]: energy-efficient way because we're hearing
that candidates are rolling out these
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my view, any of these plans whether
you're a state official or a federal
[SPEAKER_00]: official or in another country,
if you're not addressing energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impacts in these plans,
your legalization plan is not yet
[SPEAKER_00]: complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join me, get in touch with them,
get in touch with me, and let's all see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do this together in an
energy-efficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
