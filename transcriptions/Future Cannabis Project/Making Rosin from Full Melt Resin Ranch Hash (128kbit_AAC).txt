[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so 0.8, 0.8 is what I actually need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a little bit on the lid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at least 0.9.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does shatter like you said
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I experience that every time and it's too
mouthy to do anything with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we got straight 0.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to get a full 0.1 or just a
full 1 to do the... Well, so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually also what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to put them all together and
then just press it and take it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's your call.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that makes the most sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the easiest, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff smells so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time you got to try and get it
funneled in like one jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these guys do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try and get it off here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's completely melt melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't beat yourself about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to scrape it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other ones were like scraping pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's spinning every time I try to
move it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes it really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just pulling them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're trying to scrape the crumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.65.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, 2.7.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did this turn off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I accidentally unplugged it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say it's not hot
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I hit this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.7.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to have to switch
gloves here because these are so messy
[SPEAKER_03]: already.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this silkscreen is really difficult
with the sticky gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong pouch.
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So number 25, it's almost good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using a 25 micron screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to use that for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you make
[SPEAKER_02]: a custom individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it's such a small mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to really benefit us to use
a whole bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I find it to be maybe even
wasteful with the bag on such a small
[SPEAKER_03]: mouth because so much gets trapped in the
little corner seams and shit that it's got
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a live rosin for us today with
Starshine of Teletank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Teletank Squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: High grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, present some high grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a resin ranch GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now he's preparing the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to back up the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put a double wrap on it just
because it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_03]: productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is some stinky, stinky stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just test the speed.
Is this
[SPEAKER_02]: a press or is this a test?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is the press.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just still piling up in the speed of
the plate closing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is goop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to blow out if I'm not careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with a double wrap and a small,
small amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get in there and see this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Back it off a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid it's going to blow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 PSI still.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't went over 20 even yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say good job to the guys at
Resin Ranch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy God.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks like water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the lightest colored tint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe you added some lemon and some
honey to your water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's sweaty over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's fucking honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're pretty much done here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it goes up so much slower right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep the light there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally smells like our friend
Demetri.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a crazy sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It transformed the sense of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some lamb lamb blingy blow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell you what.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't really even see it on the paper in
the center spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't even see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we see the light?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or your phone on flashlight?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to illuminate from behind for my
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can see that it's completely
clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it was worth it by the
expensive web camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cooled off a bit now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can collect it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you should just do right off
the bat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take that one gram you're talking
about and put it right off these drips.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the purest of the pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell me no, scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do what I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're going to have to do a second
press on that bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not focusing on it very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tried to focus on it for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it goes in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to figure out what its focus thing
is because it doesn't have one that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can choose, but I found it and that's
perfect.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good view of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this thing have smell-o-vision on it
or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The odor of this grandpa mouth.
Woo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good picture of it just like that,
in that state.
Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to pull back off of it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has like a 50% yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's still a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the second gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm curious because it should be one
third of the ratio just because this is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to end up being like super small
amount of diamonds we want to get a fatty
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of, or like an even ratio or some,
I don't really know what things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some good amounts so that it's like a
pretty decent diamonds and then like even,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might be less than a half a gram there,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wrong button.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I know when I press that
button.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I felt this for such a quick second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold in, gold out.
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resin ranch farmers are definitely farming
that resin, that fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the way to 70?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2.7.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually crazy.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: 77%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking wild, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't know what the ratio,
I guess it would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll still do this one again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the higher temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it up right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you got a gram to make the goods out
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one gram produces this much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy math.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really anxious to play with this
stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a little trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts getting too warm to get it off
your finger and you just take the glove
[SPEAKER_03]: off your finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of not really on my finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it to cool off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it coming bigger.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that shit is so freaking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up eating it.
Pretty funky.
Honestly
[SPEAKER_03]: though, don't look that much better than
his hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that shit is wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is very stinky now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell it so, so stinky now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch me, watch me there.
Watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch me whip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not watch me nae nae.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a retardo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty much done whipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really fucking activated now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll butter in about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus Christ.
I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, yeah, I mean, that shit's
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it's going to be buttered by the
time I'm done forming it up into a patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally the most gorgeous fucking
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a second squish real quick here.
[SPEAKER_03]: 180 degree now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the first one?
[SPEAKER_02]: 160.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that just went low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured with this we wouldn't have to go
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: we should have.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit is so, whew, you're wild.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: so he said, why do you whip it for
consistency?
[SPEAKER_02]: People are commenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What size micron bags do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we're using 25, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not sure what size micron bags
of the hash he used there, but 25 micron
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 to 149.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, my silk screen here is 25
micron, which is a little lower than you
[SPEAKER_03]: really need to go for doing hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: 37 is my usual, but this stuff is really,
it just makes it really clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's also double usable,
or doubly used as the thing that we wrap
[SPEAKER_03]: the rosin back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make the THCA extract out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh fuck yeah, he said thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then whipping it does, it just kind of
kicks in the nucleation process,
[SPEAKER_03]: which helps to cause it to butter or
change consistencies, which you need it to
[SPEAKER_03]: be in that kind of tackier consistency or
less messy before you can actually make it
[SPEAKER_03]: into the THCA effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, most of it will ooze out of the
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was unwipped, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first gram that we didn't whip
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the second gram that he whipped on
camera in front of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the difference between the
two clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was just whipped for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was not whipped at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
Focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three people in the house now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does look fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, neighbors?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it's these guys following on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Resin Ranch Extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, this is hella dang squishing the
house, star trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy knows what he's doing as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my limiting factors are out of my
hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people are growing good product and
they're isolating it with clean methods,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you can pretty much just skate by on
this end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, thank you, job411.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just donated lemons to our channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: When life gives you lemons, you squish
them, motherfuckers, into some dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to form this into kind of a
nice little squarish shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get it buttered in the form that we
want to wrap it in the final bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have to wait until it's buttered
to do that, but we're going to get it in
[SPEAKER_03]: that shape now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, thank you, Lab Max Flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just donated lemons as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're going to have some lemonades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is time for the second press.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get much out the second time
around, but it's still a beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's still clear.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garlic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes out in 2021, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need that, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's put this over here so I can
collect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can unicorns swim, too, or just fly?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thoughts of a rosin master as the
rosin is being made.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the thoughts that keep me up at
night, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously they can breathe in
outer space, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, yeah, of course they can swim
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And answer that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bam, there's the second press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Higher heat usually makes it a darker
color, but it's still fire looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it still looks almost the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready to go try a dab of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fuck yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can just shut this down now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like make that into some tea later or
something, which you should do there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to do a third squish on it,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's your call if you want to or
anything, but thank you for this fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do an episode part two coming up
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rappy high day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay lit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you later.
