[SPEAKER_02]: At Quasar, that's the same heating element
that Frenchie has on his hookah,
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so if you look in there...
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of hash, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we smoking here?
[SPEAKER_02]: That one is from the grow-off this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the NorCal grow-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the NorCal grow-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funky strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found out it's called caramel cream or
caramel cream, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had some really interesting bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've obviously smoked this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just starting to get into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of an interesting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shannon and I had some earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Today or yesterday?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it reminds me of headband.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because you get that, you know,
that feeling of your forehead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And did we enjoy that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're very nondiscriminatory.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so where'd you pick the... Everyone
gets clones, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So where'd you get the clones from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where was the drop?
[SPEAKER_02]: This year it was up at Satori Wellness,
up in McKinleyville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a great dispensary up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love heading up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did the pick up up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all got our clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was funny is this year,
the clone pick up was just the day before
[SPEAKER_02]: the Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so instead of going all the way back
down to Sonoma County and then back up to
[SPEAKER_02]: Meadowlands, we wound up taking our clones
camping with us for three days at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Meadowlands event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they stayed in a teepee with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, right after Meadowlands,
you went up to Satori.
[SPEAKER_07]: The day before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the day before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was the day before Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the pick up party up at Satori
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we all grabbed our clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a bunch of us that wound up
going back to Meadowlands and camping with
[SPEAKER_02]: our clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's why I was going to ask,
like you like baby your clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we put them in the teepee with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And did you have a good time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that How Could You Not Meadowlands
is one of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a big, deep, breath for
everybody to get out in the woods and just
[SPEAKER_02]: stop and realize the dog games we've been
living in.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could go hang out on a campground
with a bunch of other people who like
[SPEAKER_07]: smoking weed, like one Saturday a month or
one weekend a month, that would be
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy's on top of this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the beer and all the display
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's for somewhere here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, good man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit drinking last month.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: The alcohol does not stick to the line or
the can unlike cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's just a big article on Yahoo
Finance today about how people doing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, cannabis beverages and after
about six months, all of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: have stuck to the liners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no cannabinoids in the beverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this guy came in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was doing a fucking illegal dab in
venison.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, I don't think a CBD water.
[SPEAKER_06]: What relief does that give you over actual
water?
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, it's got CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too shitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got electrolytes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plastic bottle has CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your water is CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you bring the Durban poison?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have it because somebody is tuning in
from South Africa and smoking a great
[SPEAKER_07]: local grown cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a jar of the Durban right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought over by Ed Rosenthal in the early
70s.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you sit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sit dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not talking about packaging,
you're talking about the brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Shannon should be on talking
about the packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a box.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a sticker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a sticker on a sticker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're going to get from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's red.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should do a dab though.
[SPEAKER_04]: A pre-dab dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-dab dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camera's like, I don't want a dab dab
enough to get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one thing I said is as long as
I'm down here, getting back up is the
[SPEAKER_02]: tough part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on the ground, it's no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, you're down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this like the whole Fiddler's
Green's lineup?
[SPEAKER_07]: For the tinctures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, for the tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the tincture line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your timing is amazing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, is that my good timing?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's hold off on the... I'll
go back to bonheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so tell me about the tinctures.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're extracted solventlessly,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an infusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a strain-specific whole flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow the flowers ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow the flowers ourselves on our farm
in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the very first permitted farm in
Sonoma County for outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been growing the ACDC for many
years, and it loves the Petaluma Wind Gap
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're at.
[SPEAKER_06]: Petaluma Wind Gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Petaluma Wind Gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we infuse the whole flower directly
into organic olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't use an extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use solvents or chemicals or
isolates or reconstituted funkiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just whole plant goodness in organic
first-pressed virgin olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do an ACDC for our high CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have OG Kush for our high THC strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our Kindred Spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a balanced blend of both strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get the full cannabinoid and
terpene profile from both strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we offer these three in both the
raw form and the tan boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's non-decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the flower as it is on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's CBDA, THCA, CBGA, all the acidic
cannabinoids which are extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work amazingly well at low dose as a
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a raw vegetable versus a cooked
vegetable.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually way better for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need less of it for the same
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the exact same three,
but these have been decarboxylated and
[SPEAKER_02]: heated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis has to be heated to get you high.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by the way, Jody found a grocery store
and got a six pack and then came back.
[SPEAKER_07]: With all this stuff too, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless 7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get shit done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take care of the bosses.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like me with my parents when
they're playing golf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the scene with the old couple in
Caddyshack?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a peach on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like me and my parents.
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom's like half blind.
[SPEAKER_07]: She can't see where her balls go and they
like dribble like eight feet that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to talk brand new.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, where did the name Fiddler's Greens
come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiddler's Greens is a mythological place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sailors paradise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where we go and we die.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the music never ends,
the dancers never tire, and the cups are
[SPEAKER_02]: always full.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shannon and I are both sailors and
have the nautical theme there and it also
[SPEAKER_02]: has been adopted by a lot of military.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ford firing base in the Hamelin
province, Afghanistan's Fiddler's Greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the, I think it's the E club at
Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: The artillery base is Fiddler's Greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hundreds of Irish pubs named
Fiddler's Green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, you know, the myth is that
once you go there when you die,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of a purgatory before you have
to go to hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And us being sailors, we know we're going
to hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it's your time to go,
you fill your cup up one last time from
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiddler's Green and march off to the gates
of hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if your cup gets empty before you
reach there, you have to turn around and
[SPEAKER_02]: go back to Fiddler's Green to refill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rudyard Kipling wrote a great poem
about it that I believe the Army Cavalry,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, you know, I love it when we have the
Army Cav vets come in because they'll come
[SPEAKER_02]: up and recite the entire poem to us at the
booth all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also named our distribution
company High Tide Distribution because we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to raise all the ships.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm a boat captain,
a sailing instructor, and we just had the
[SPEAKER_02]: nautical theme.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I love is you want to raise all the
ships.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was definitely not the philosophy
of all the companies that are just
[SPEAKER_07]: imploding right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like karma is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Together we'll survive separately or all
down, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go further.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and this is there's so many
people, like at Sonoma County,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was an estimated 5000 cultivators
before Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's 18 permits, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not what the community's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, you know, the people who have
been, you know, kept this going,
[SPEAKER_02]: the real rebels and misfits and outlaws
and the people who, you know, had the
[SPEAKER_02]: balls to do this when they were sending
helicopters and jackbooted thugs and guns
[SPEAKER_02]: after us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bureaucrats are ruining that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can't stop now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to keep going at them and change
the rules and change the laws and make it
[SPEAKER_02]: so this plant's available for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jody, you take the contrarian view and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck these hippies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just here to make a buck.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a grow 300 feet from my house and
my parents won't let me have friends over
[SPEAKER_06]: and my friend's parents won't let them
come over because they're afraid of the
[SPEAKER_06]: grow near my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's drug dealers.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people are making fun of us because
we're hanging out with tinctures and not
[SPEAKER_07]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So get to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so for example, I take the CBD THC
blend because I smoke CBD and THC all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the raw tinctures, like we were saying,
are better for you, but it's a,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're cannabinoids that people don't get
that often in their normal diets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the hemp started growing,
stopped growing fairly, the cows,
[SPEAKER_06]: the pigs, the chickens don't eat it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't get it as part of our natural
diet, which we were supposed to,
[SPEAKER_06]: but was cut off to nature when it was made
illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now any opportunity you can get to get
the raw cannabinoids, to get the CBD,
[SPEAKER_07]: the THC, a super high CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so for example, the ACDC raw is a 40
to one CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a jar somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just displays.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're killing me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that my backpack?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's under this bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to roll a joint of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do the grow off, but hand me my bag
behind you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weighs a ton.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the CBD THC balance, but there's
still no, virtually no THC in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the best one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're going to sit here and smoke
THC, we don't need that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the raw version.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, so what's the ratio on this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's technically a one to one,
but very different from a normal one to
[SPEAKER_06]: one where that you're getting all the
genetics of ACDC, which is a 40 to one CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: to THC, and then all the genetics of OG
Kutch, which is a high THC, formulated
[SPEAKER_06]: together to make a balanced version of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because very few people have anxiety,
but not pain or pain, but not anxiety.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because everyone's bodies are
different, some people's CBD works great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have either.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people's THC works great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pain free and I'm anxiety free.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like a multi-vibe if you're
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is obviously child proof.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got lots of kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we recommend, yeah, five to 10 drops to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be treated as a sublingual,
which if you swirl it through your mouth
[SPEAKER_02]: for 30 seconds, a minute or so,
it'll go into your bloodstream through
[SPEAKER_02]: your cheeks and your gums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll take effect within 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you just swallow it straight
away, it acts as an edible, goes through
[SPEAKER_02]: your digestion, gets processed by your
liver, and does the conversion to
[SPEAKER_02]: 11-hydroxymetabolite just as an ordinary
edible would.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, but can all of it go through,
like if I hold it in my mouth long enough,
[SPEAKER_07]: all of it will go through the bloodstream?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the majority of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the time you swallow what's left.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not swallowing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly saliva.
[SPEAKER_06]: The membranes are so thin here that in
about 30 seconds it just absorbs right
[SPEAKER_06]: into your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because so many of your cannabinoid
receptors are in your head, you get relief
[SPEAKER_06]: real quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of eating an Advil or an Edible
or Xanax that's going through your stomach
[SPEAKER_06]: acid, your stomach, your kidney,
your liver, this just goes straight there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're maximizing your bioavailability
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also gives you more option to treat
different types of sleep deprivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the big questions we ask people
when they say I can't sleep is,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, do you have trouble falling asleep
or do you have trouble staying asleep?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it means a big difference in how
you're going to go at the problem of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like literally about eight seconds after I
get in the bed, I'm out of cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say no problem because I'm
fucking exhausted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I don't have fucking huge doses of
THC in me when I go to bed, I have insane
[SPEAKER_06]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_06]: My brain goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you don't have the THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the THC will keep your brain from
going too far in the REM cycle so that you
[SPEAKER_06]: still get a good night's sleep,
but you don't remember your dreams as
[SPEAKER_06]: much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when people have PTSD and shit like
that, it's showing really great effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you wake up in the middle of
the night and you smoke again,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to kick you back into the REM
cycle where you're going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you take too much before you go to
bed and you wake up to pee, you are
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking tripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not saying this from experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are saying this from experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're testing out the quality of certain
FECOs, full extract cannabis oils,
[SPEAKER_02]: or people call them Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started taking doses every night
before bed and ramping that dose up every
[SPEAKER_02]: couple days to see how the effects were
and what would happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we skipped a few days there and ramped
it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we doubled or tripled the dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: It turns out four grains of rice is too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of us woke up the next morning
tripping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight hours later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight hours later.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to bed, you expect to wake up
sober.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, start getting together.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell me about growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the grow off cultivar?
[SPEAKER_07]: Caramel cream.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked that joint this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was telling him it kind of reminds
me of headband.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what about growing it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you just grow one clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the grow off, everybody gets the two
cuts and then you take them back to your
[SPEAKER_02]: farm and grow them the way you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people who do it indoor,
outdoor, greenhouse, light depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then farms like us who are full sun,
full soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: These clones actually came to Meadowlands
with us and spent the weekend in a tent
[SPEAKER_06]: with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_07]: While he disappeared for like an hour,
we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: 18 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, I think you may have been
looking for a store.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, well, he doesn't need to
do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will definitely be psyched to be able to
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have just jumped in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just figured I'd pass one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then all of a sudden I was here and I was
like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, we also have.
[SPEAKER_07]: So talk about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the shredded box.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do this better without this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is their house brand of CBD,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Jody, do you ever smoke out of this
thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a soccer mom tool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's fucking awesome because it's
vaping whole flour instead of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes you feel way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just flew up to the northwest and I had
to stop off at a few different airports
[SPEAKER_02]: with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to fly and hit it the whole
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the first thing I said to the
founders was like, I saved these things
[SPEAKER_07]: just to reuse them for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you guys don't make that someone
else is, it's not very hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Refillable ceramic straw would be no
problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, ceramic would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'd be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make the little ceramic one hitters
for the dugouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Richard is sending me a prototype.
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could make a fortune just selling the
pokers because I think anybody who's ever
[SPEAKER_02]: owned a prototype has bent or lost the
poker on those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the first pipe I ever smoked out
of when I was like in sixth grade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: With my son, the youngest of four,
the next brother is four years older.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like he used to have a fake drawer
and that's where his weed was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I discovered it, I was like,
all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were starting to get some traction
with this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's such a simple way to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The packaging is crazy about, you know,
recyclable whole flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I think the whole line is consistent
packaging, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if someone else created a product,
they'd have to use this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're sourcing from a lot of great
farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're providing flower for several of
their skews.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're also helping them find
flower from other good farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to keep the farm intact
all the way through the process so that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the end consumer knows where the
flower is grown, what region, who did it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the terroir?
[SPEAKER_07]: So by the way, if people were making fun
of us for hanging out with the tinctures
[SPEAKER_06]: and now we're hitting like a thousand
different ways to have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get three minutes on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually hammer this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it counts down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You about 15 hits off it before you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys great.
[SPEAKER_06]: The kids fucking bark.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave him three packs and he got a lot to
share them.
[SPEAKER_06]: He even got fucking nine bags,
wrote all bartenders names on them and
[SPEAKER_06]: then pull one of them and then wrote on
each stick what it was and then pull a
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking three of them in each bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow, man, that's fucking well
done, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sticking with packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this good enough for you fuckers?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need to feed him lines,
you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like what was kind of like when you
guys were looking for sourcing packaging
[SPEAKER_07]: form factors and providers, what were you
looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really tough thing because the
packaging and compliance laws are so
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have all of this room for
everything that they require on there
[SPEAKER_02]: from, you know, the California cannabis
symbol to your lab testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have tamper evidence seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have child resistant packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prop 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prop 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has to be this font.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has to be this size.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've actually changed our packaging what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Six times in the last three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to keep changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're using is this glass?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, that's like a conscious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's more expensive than plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you talk about those decisions like
you guys want to be environmentally
[SPEAKER_07]: conscious?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while the regulations make it very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that and most everything that's
affordable within the price range is all
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from China.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, right now, we've got the
coronavirus and we've got a whole province
[SPEAKER_02]: is being shut down and we're just coming
off of Chinese New Year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't order around Chinese New
Year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been really putting in a lot
of effort to find locally sourced,
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable, small family businesses who
are putting us all together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So use China like not being able to
deliver as another reason to go with like
[SPEAKER_07]: American, whatever like packaging
providers and then be able to tell that
[SPEAKER_07]: story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real challenge, especially for
people that are in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: that started out as farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as the cultivator, you're used to
having to do everything from your seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock, your clone stock to amending your
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're developing your hydro or developing
your your indoor system to growing the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants all the way through the system,
being the horticulturist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would do your own curing,
which you'd have to build out another
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to have carpentry and
electrical skills or somebody that does
[SPEAKER_02]: that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you do your trimming or you bring
in a trim crew and then you sell it and
[SPEAKER_02]: get your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the people that that was the whole
industry and you controlled it from end to
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've got marketing and packaging and
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a whole team of people
that specialize in every little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you go into a dispensary with
a product now, the compliance officers are
[SPEAKER_02]: back there with a microscope and they're
going over every letter of every package
[SPEAKER_02]: at that shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They open every box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if things don't match up, things
aren't right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are obligated under the regulations
to reduce or reject it and send it back,
[SPEAKER_02]: which jams up the whole system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is where a lot of the extra
cost is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the legal market is we're all
having to jump through hoops to package,
[SPEAKER_02]: repackage, unsticker, resticker,
change the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've even seen where the purchasers had a
ruler measuring the size of the California
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis symbol because there's specs on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just make a photocopy sticker
and put it on there, it might be just a
[SPEAKER_02]: smidge off, but it's out of compliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because everything's so complicated
now, everyone's following the rules,
[SPEAKER_06]: but slightly different variations of Prop
64.
[SPEAKER_06]: They joke about it being like the Bible
where it's a great story being interpreted
[SPEAKER_06]: a hundred different ways by people,
which is crazy because we have all sorts
[SPEAKER_06]: of different places.
[SPEAKER_06]: They require different things of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this place you can't do this,
this place you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of how I view all the
religions.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Judaism to Christianity to
Islam, like they all believe the same
[SPEAKER_07]: starting stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's like, Christianity is like,
no, there was this next dude called Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Muslims are like, no,
no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: We agree there was Jesus, but then there
was another dude after him named Muhammad,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they all agree with everything before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's like some divergence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave up a religion for Lent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, again.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because you also have the pre-rolls and
then you have the, uh, the healing balm.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a healing balm as well that we use
the raw Siddic kindred spirit and we named
[SPEAKER_02]: it kindred spirit because THC and CBD are
spirit molecules or sister molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They boost each other up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They temper each other out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make each other work better together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also the name of the sailboat
that Shannon and I rebuilt and lived on
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while is kindred spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we like to tie it back in and that's
another thing with your packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make some, make it mean something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just listen to a marketing person.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this, this is you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you lived and you guys knew each other
from what Island?
[SPEAKER_02]: From St. Croix and the Virgin Islands over
20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there about 10 years and you were
there 17.
[SPEAKER_06]: We live together from 2001 to 2004.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 2004.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, it's Celtics double overtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started out making pot ice cream in the
Virgin Islands over 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would make pot brownie ice cream
sandwiches and wrap them in foil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a sticker on them, red beards
and ice creams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a little mobile ice cream cart,
push it on, on the boardwalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we paid bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, for Shannon and I, our first
date, I was selling pot brownies out of a
[SPEAKER_02]: backpack at the club I took her to.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the tourists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Locals at that time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you need another drink?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to sell a couple of these brownies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trigger this for a drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the barter system is alive and
well in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did stuff grow down there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really well, but it's 12 and 12 year
round.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, your veg cycle is a little
bit different and then curing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you have a lot of humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why a lot of the Caribbean flower
has that golden or brown color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially humid areas because they're
curing it in places or drying it in places
[SPEAKER_02]: where they don't have AC or, or humidity
controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're generally doing it just blocked
from the shade with as much airflow as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Caribbean and that, you know,
the equatorial places, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some great land race strains that
are going to start popping back up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be interesting to see because if
you can greenhouse and light depth and get
[SPEAKER_02]: your, your plant sized up, you could do
some really big full season turns in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're going to have to do mixed
light.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just no way around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they said you're 12 and 12 the
whole time is you have to mix light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't do an indoor grow because
the electricity is so unreliable down
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to have a generator almost
running full time.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you need is like what Zellig has like
you did the other day, Peter, where you
[SPEAKER_06]: need a glass greenhouse with mixed light
inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can do a combination of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And solar, solar and LED to reduce,
you know, your electrical and also reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: the heat in there because, you know,
the Caribbean's so hot already and it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have to grow some really
strains that are mold and mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So are there any genetics that you took
from there that you grew up in Sonoma?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, but we had a partner who has
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of those things that if
you're in the industry at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have you're going to run
into some feisty people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've lost a lot of our genetics
over the years and we found new ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have like our Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been grown in our family of
cultivators for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a family thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whoever needs cuts, somebody always has
cuts and we've always just shared and
[SPEAKER_02]: helped each other out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was grown in the Virgin Islands too
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Durban.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you guys now have up in...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some cuts made their way to St.
Croix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then is the stuff growing up in Sonoma
like progeny of what was growing in St.
[SPEAKER_07]: Croix?
[SPEAKER_02]: It came from Sonoma County to St. Croix,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are cousins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's cousins.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that have this and
have shared it out within this group.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my question was going to be,
did these South African genetics acclimate
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves to St. Croix and then were then
moved like kids like army brats moving
[SPEAKER_07]: around the world with their parents or
something being like, ah, totally new
[SPEAKER_07]: climate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you keep cloning the same
mother in that location, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to start seeing that change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you just take a cut to a
new environment, it's not going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: that memory to do the next generation if
it's moved immediately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I was thinking about plants that grew
up in just perfect weather environments
[SPEAKER_07]: and then suddenly they're moved to a much
harsher environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's one of the theories on why it
produces cannabinoids, that the Indus
[SPEAKER_02]: Valley where it was in those areas,
when the plate shifted and the Himalayas
[SPEAKER_02]: were formed, it was forced from more of a
sea level up into a higher elevation and
[SPEAKER_02]: it forced the plant to produce the
cannabinoids in the resin glands as UV
[SPEAKER_02]: protection on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they believe that drastic change in
elevation during its development was one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the causes for the production of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: But were those tectonic movements like in
a couple of days or over like millions of
[SPEAKER_07]: years?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it was like a gentle
acclimation of like 10 feet higher than
[SPEAKER_07]: where we were last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but a gentle earthquake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how long did mountains take to form?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they like overnight or like an
earthquake?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, slow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's your young Jamie to pull up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want another one?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, cause I would have Ubered here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a car here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only reason for strength.
[SPEAKER_06]: These clouds have seen the best and the
worst of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes led the way on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other night when I, or Tuesday night
when I drove home from here, I was like
[SPEAKER_07]: super high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my contacts were like dry and glued to
my eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was just like, oh, the stress
miserable.
[SPEAKER_06]: High is no problem for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the fucking five years and shots that
I want to have.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about the package.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to make your packaging mean
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't go to a marketer and say this
color pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the logo that's going to be an
eye catcher of this season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go look at the dispensary shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, it all looks like the same
company designed half of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no personality in big marketing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this has a personality and like,
I know it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a little Cresco.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's very crisp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it, but it doesn't show your
personality.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only 11 people in this company and
we're still a family run business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important for us to have our
personality.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many people came from St. Croix to
work?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you, at one point there was five of
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot and a lot of people,
you know, I'm from California and wound up
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Virgin Islands and came back and,
and, uh, it's just California,
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like where in California?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the whole West coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shannon, we've lived in Tahoe,
uh, Marina Del Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then we, Juneau, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've earned some sea time working out of
Juneau, Alaska, Vancouver, British
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia, uh, like Tahoe, LA, San Diego
and Sonata.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a professional captain at the time
and couldn't touch anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, from what other people told
you it was crippling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause some of the, some of the first
trains I ever got to smoke were from
[SPEAKER_02]: Alaska and like Alaska, Thunderfuck and
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is all grown indoor in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, what, what, what I was saying about
like, like, let's say you're some happy
[SPEAKER_07]: land race and some chill Mediterranean
environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like the next seed pops and it's
in like a shitty indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like not a good one, but like a terrible
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the stress makes the plant
perform better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like our ACDC, if you give it a perfect
environment and an indoor grow with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the right nutrients and happy soil and
perfect light and temperature and
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity, it looks like an octopus on
Quaaludes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of lays down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, key fell out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like something's making noise over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also production of cannabinoids
and terpenes is in response to a defense
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the heavy wind or predation or bugs,
um, strengthen and build the plant up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys go out there and slap them
around a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we go out and love them and kiss them
and hug them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked to them kindly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I miss doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started making edibles and cultivating
and you know, now being in the business of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, I haven't touched a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And years, you know, would love my
cultivation team to death, but I wish I
[SPEAKER_02]: was with them every day instead of,
you know, out trying to, this isn't too
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, all the hoops we have to jump
through instead of just being cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's the most regulated
market in the world and it's led by the
[SPEAKER_02]: misinformed and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my favorite one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use this one every day because we,
as we smoke, we get a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylated cannabis in our diets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the acidic cannabinoids,
especially the balance ratio, the kindred
[SPEAKER_02]: spirit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that balances out the balance of
all your other major systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your gut, your mood, your pain,
your appetite is all balanced out by your
[SPEAKER_06]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the kindred spirit is actually ACDC
and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're getting twice the genetics
working together, not just a one-to-one
[SPEAKER_06]: strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're maximizing the combination of
cannabinoids and terpene that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: getting your endocannabinoid system,
which in turn is maximizing the balance of
[SPEAKER_06]: the rest of your systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys going to make a hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, uh, yes, we've, we used to make
bubble hash, but uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the old backyard style with the trash can
in the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, that's in the works now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our manufacturing site is getting up and
going and we're starting to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can that be on site?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like on the farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no, no, we have a manufacturing
facility for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have cultivation, manufacturing and
distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to do that and keep ourselves whole
through the market because it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we couldn't find anybody to
represent us the way that we wanted to be
[SPEAKER_02]: represented.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you doing fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you like drying and curing and then
using that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we use, we believe in the cure and it
actually helps retain the acidic
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, that and the olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, long slow cure is one of the most
important parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow the best cannabis in the
world and if you don't cure it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to smell like hay and taste
horrible and smoke horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, why go through the box?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to age wine, you know,
you got to let it ripen and you oxidize
[SPEAKER_02]: just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to let the cannabinoids and
terpenes reach their full potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so many people want to rush their
cannabis to market, but when you're making
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine, it's important to let it cure
properly so that it settles into itself
[SPEAKER_06]: and the right cannabinoids and terpenes
show themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: But people who talk about fresh frozen for
hash making talk about like freezing the
[SPEAKER_07]: maximum essence of that plant just as it's
harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very fresh and, and bright tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, I believe in the old temple
ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making hash, you know, I love listening to
Frenchy can only talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes older cured flower to make his
hash with as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts on what we're
seeing right here?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm new to the concentrate
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a flower guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: My whole life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly the bong is my best friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, but they've enjoyed trying the
different versions of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is, uh, George green thumb.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was here two nights ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I bought this tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a illegal dab bars down in
Venice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the craziest things about the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is for so many years, you know,
you didn't tell anybody your real name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't loan them, let them know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never let anybody come over to your
house or talk about what you did or how
[SPEAKER_02]: you did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't that long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure people are laughing at this one
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I'm not sure if this is hot
enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put the on man version.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no carburetor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd use the glass on, uh, that's plastic,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It blew up too.
[SPEAKER_07]: 700 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are mad at us for doing tanks
early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm new.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's glass on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume it's glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stopping.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, what are these two?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the caramel cream was the grow off
flower for this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other was the pineapple tie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought there were three on the table
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Durbin, the jar Durbin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pineapple tie finally smelled like
pineapple this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: We pressed it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now because of the regulations,
we couldn't grow these in our permitted
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to do this in our personal garden
off to the side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that garden get a lot of love?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I wish I could be out there
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the best things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do all the other plants know that they're
your favorite children?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little isolated down there
actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a little less love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the year we won the grow off,
uh, we, we really let the plants just go
[SPEAKER_02]: for their, their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a, another, yeah, we did it in the
hugel beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it was turned into a challenging
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: We helped another farm, uh, that was
having issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We helped them through their harvest and,
uh, just didn't have time to give to the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow off plants and they just took off and
ran and loved where they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took first place for potency with,
uh, with that year and third place for
[SPEAKER_02]: terpings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turns out if you feed the soil,
you don't have to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you own a distribution company too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the farm, we have manufacturing
and distribution, but it's all out of form
[SPEAKER_02]: and function because we could,
we made all of our own products before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we couldn't find anybody who could do
the way we wanted it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the same with the distribution
when, you know, we've been growing CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: strains for seven years now, back before
anybody really knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our original seeds from Lawrence
Ringo and, uh, that was for a sour tsunami
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, been working with it for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you walk in with flour to
somebody and say, Hey, I grew this
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful flower, but it won't get you
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they originally call it the
hippies disappointment because they grew
[SPEAKER_02]: these great looking flowers and then
smoked them and they didn't get high,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they noticed how much better they felt
after they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's always saying, well, I didn't get
as high, but it was a much better feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a better balance of CBD and THC
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Lawrence Ringo was
noticing because he had back issues and he
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed he was able to do more things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they started working more on
breeding the CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you smoked like eight joints of super
high CBD, would you eventually just get
[SPEAKER_07]: super like, would the THC catch up?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it would be like trying to get drunk
off of non-alcoholic beer, but it does
[SPEAKER_07]: have some alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time you got to the 30th one,
it would be out of your system from
[SPEAKER_06]: already before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you did it within like an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've also done things like,
cause if you drank this whole bottle,
[SPEAKER_06]: you wouldn't get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever tried it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken quite a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What CBD does is it changes the way that
THC binds to the CB1 receptor and it
[SPEAKER_02]: lowers the, the, the peak of how high
you're going to get with the THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it makes it last longer because it
slows down the reuptake of
[SPEAKER_02]: neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're going to find that balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kindred spirit with the balance of the
two, the CBD and the THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's your bet?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think if Jody drank that whole
bottle, he would get high or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've taken a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bottle of ACD.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I put him to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just slowly melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but CBD is also can be very
focusing, like, you know, almost an
[SPEAKER_02]: adderall where you just want to sit down
and do things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could drink a small bottle of the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, yeah, that's 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's the ratio on that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's, there's just a minimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the exact same thing as this,
but this is not decarboxia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis has to be heated to get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the exact same plant probably came
from the exact same branch, except this,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis was heated and decarboxia
before in the olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the raw natural plant the way
it is in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think, if you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So each of those went through a different
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same exact flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one was in the oven for a period of
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_06]: What should he not say?
[SPEAKER_06]: I make up a round number now and throw it
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's close enough for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to be so open and transparent about
everything we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we realize, you know,
some things we have to keep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and we're just open people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's tough for us to like,
you know, go, oh, well, this is what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how we do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just love talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but this one, you know, this is THC is
amazing for aches, pains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's, uh, headaches, cramps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're arthritic dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're arthritic grandmother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got hit by a car two months ago when I
used that as my anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use this after doing a long demo,
uh, because your feet just getting all
[SPEAKER_02]: nasty, but it's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they won't, it's not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a day job or you have to
work with kids and you need THC for the
[SPEAKER_02]: pain relief, you can do THCA without the
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this one's the exact same flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one will get you high as a giraffe's
ass because it's been decarboxidated and
[SPEAKER_02]: heated.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now you don't need the third glass of
wine, the ambient, the painkiller at the
[SPEAKER_06]: end of the night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use your natural endocannabinoid system to
find how many.
[SPEAKER_07]: As the master SoCal salesman, how many
shops do you visit a day and how many,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, what do you call them now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like patient appreciation,
but we do patient education.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just cause we make, you know, when you
make five products, it won't get people
[SPEAKER_06]: high.
[SPEAKER_06]: The education means everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're basically just talking about
education.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually really sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need his passion to sell that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and that's where we really got our
expertise too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear it's good for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had to learn and talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go and sit and listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't come up to the booth,
we're going to bring them up to the booth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does your mom not sleep?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does your grandmother have arthritis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a dog that is anxious or has
arthritis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does your kid on Adderall?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can help you even if it's not for you,
please do listen to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're a total stoner, but it must
be someone in your family.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will make you high too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a sublingual edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I travel and I just take the label off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just cannabis and olive oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we really had to dive into the
education to be able to explain this to
[SPEAKER_02]: purchasers who explain it to the blood
tenders, who explain it to the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we try to educate at all the
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we go and listen to the people who
do the research, the doctors and the
[SPEAKER_02]: clinicians, we go and sit in their
continuing education classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to medical conferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had to go and learn everything about
the endocannabinoid system and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing and learn about the support groups
and all the people that are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: putting this to practice every day as a
medicine, as a healing tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're trying to raise that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I didn't go to college for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Making and prescribing medicine for babies
and puppies.
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like it's made in like a 3D
printer, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like with silicone, probably
injection molded.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cameron's got one called the ash,
the ash hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ash ash hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's called ash bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little pokey thing sticking up
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to pack some and then put some
hash in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hash bowl is better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can smoke this stuff and enjoy it
without crackheading myself again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still reflect on the brilliance of puff
Co.
[SPEAKER_06]: offering them as the awards for the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: To think that the top three people in
every category in the Emerald Cup now have
[SPEAKER_06]: a puff coat in their house.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see that this year, Peter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: The trophies at the Emerald Cup this year
were personalized puffcoats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we get our product into your hands?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, into the best of the best hands too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just throwing fucking shit the
one over and it sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the other on YouTube talking about
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love my puffcoats.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't be happier.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like them to gift one to us so
we can have one on set.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be a puffcoat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I would blow myself up with a
freaking crack torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to give a shout out to Oney's.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys, Josh sent me a thing today
since I found my original vape pad.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he flashed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a baddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is a baddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like something I used to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: To get this to slide?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like child proof?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's CR.
[SPEAKER_07]: CR packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so what do I have to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to pull this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this relatively clean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there anything in there right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to not like those things because I
would rather have people thought that I
[SPEAKER_06]: was smoking pot than smoking a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was always frustrating.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, I saw you smoking a
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love baddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss baddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember being in a bar in Billy Bob's
in Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing Willie Nelson at Billy Bob's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having this in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were standing a couple people
behind the bouncers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could still smoke cigarettes in
bars back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took that thing, took a big puff,
blow it in the back of the bouncer's head,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it back in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stand there like nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch them run around trying to find out
who was smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then wait until they settle down and
then do it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what was in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mixed salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little Durban, some mama's boy,
some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Captain's Blend.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what genetics, what are you guys
growing that's not going on in the market?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the personal grow?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Durban for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's that the Durban is just being
released now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't see a ton of Durban in the
market, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see it in the hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys are growing that
commercially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are you growing that isn't making
it to market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you growing that you guys are
smoking that nobody else gets to smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: We had pineapple tie in our personal
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the pineapple tie.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we did some Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the caramel cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, our personal garden was our R&D
garden this year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the tough thing is you have to make
the most use you can out of your permitted
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that only leaves you your six personal
plants outside of that to do R&D or
[SPEAKER_02]: personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nice because for our farm,
we grow a bunch of all of our six plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it's going to be divided among
the staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we all get to share.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time we've released our
ACDC, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't see a ton of ACDC flower in
the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of it's blown for cartridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought the ACDC has been out for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been in our tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been in our tincture.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year we grew so much of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was such an awesome
representation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a 30 to 1 CBD to THC stream out of
the garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we finally took the best of the best,
the top of the tops and threw them in the
[SPEAKER_06]: jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you smoke this ACDC, it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so calming and relaxing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine without the
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could smoke ACDC all day and not get
high, but you'd feel fucking great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say that CBD does have
psychoactivity, but it's not intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can leave the burning end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's calming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It focuses you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It quiets the circus running between your
ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows you to have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's anti-psychotic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally someone that gets me.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that oney bowl, if you look at it,
we were talking about how you have to pack
[SPEAKER_02]: one for everybody, pull the bat out,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then close that back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then look on the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if you stick the bat into the
small hole on the side where your thumb
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_07]: On this side?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it turns into a bowl so you can pass
it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you still draw from the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still draw from there, but you feel
that.
So close.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there's the bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's just a huge bowl instead of just
the oney.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it turns your one hitter into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into a pipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I would put it in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed that part.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you can light this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the old school pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that at the head shop on Abbott
Kinney in Venice Beach.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't find that place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've walked down there twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be the coolest head shop we've
ever been to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Abbott Kinney.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's on Abbott Kinney.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one by the townhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have to find any landmarks in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some of this in the middle of...
Oh shit, this dude's...
[SPEAKER_07]: He should have knocked louder.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have seen the first time we did
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit the fucking cupcake club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you hit him to that hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: We fucking... At one point, there was
probably 30 people in this room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just... I was the one counting after
counting.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had fucking just jars and stuff like
that all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking room was just fucking crushed
high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then everyone fucking disappeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were in a total of maybe an hour and a
half.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this fucking band outside just
killed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like six people fucking just dancing and
fucking... It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was with Diggie Ziegler, one of the guys
that owns Ziggies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, listen, my buddy's
throwing this party, but I have no idea
[SPEAKER_06]: what to expect.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: party.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be anything, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, we're in L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we walked right in and sat right down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can held court for an hour and a half
and then went outside and fucking raged
[SPEAKER_06]: for like two hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: High as fucking lab rats.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's booze, like fucking beers and
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking booze.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like $15 or something like that to
get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking funny shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you walk in, they give you a
cupcake.
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 million dollar cupcake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's the way to start your fucking
go-get-em style.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a good fucking base for most
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just have a little lick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, once I asked her, like, did you have
those cupcakes?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think she'll understand how much
actual cupcake that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you're not ready for that,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_06]: $20 is a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two hours it takes for it to kick in,
especially in a party, you do a lot of...
[SPEAKER_06]: While you're sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a lot of smokiness in between
there.
You do a lot of smokey shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a lot of smokey shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a lot of smokey shit.
