[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got introduced to biochar not too
long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been brought to everyone's attention
on the benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Clay, I'm fortunate enough to try his
live soil as well as he makes biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he approached me wanting me to give
his biochar a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course we jumped on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really excited with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not the expert in biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Clay, tell me a little bit about my
understanding is you can use and source
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of wood to make biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the outcome will be different on what
kind of woods you're choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about what you're
doing and why you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you select?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we start with hardened soft woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: One step up that we offer in our biochar
product is we also use coastal driftwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sea is amazing for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that those logs that could
saturate in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biochars burn to a specific degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every creator of biochar has their own
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Amazonian started at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously they didn't have
thermometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They burn it to the point where my grandpa
taught me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to snuff it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of did that year after year
after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, before I bring it to any of you
guys, I definitely had to run it in our
[SPEAKER_01]: medical grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use hardwood, softwood, and the
driftwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of makes it a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different biochars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make biochar from straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the same on the molecular
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The straw isn't the same as the hardwoods
like madronas and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mother Nature's perfect store,
perfect hotel for the microbes for your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my understanding is you've moved on
using some of Mammoth products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tell me some of the goodies that
you're putting in to your biochar and your
[SPEAKER_00]: process, your teas and your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why that's so much better,
why your product has become so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biochar's whole process is to collect
nitrogens and phosphorus from the soils
[SPEAKER_01]: after a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no more foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no more roots to be able to hold
that stuff in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mother Nature doesn't want the year of
rain to come along and wash all those
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she created biochar that actually
collects it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we brew 26 organic
ingredients, amendments, everything from
[SPEAKER_01]: green sand, crustacean meal, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few secret ingredients that once
you're using it, you get told what those
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can't give all the goodies away.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually brew three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a timing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brew three different teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then towards the end, we actually add
mammoth at the end for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't put them in too early or they'll eat
everything before your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate enough to you brought
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making live soil now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he reached out to me and wanted me to
try a run of his live soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very new to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you want to tell us a little bit
about that project?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're doing with your live soil
line and how it's special?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my best friends, besides Casey,
is Marley Worm Growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sends worm castings all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of the organic amendments that
you can buy out here have one type of worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have five different types of
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also makes soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then Casey and a few other growers that
use our biochar were like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't you work on a soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually the last year, we ran
different tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been building soils for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to put a super soil out there for this
gentleman, to risk $50,000 worth of his
[SPEAKER_01]: product on, that's something big to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's pretty dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's start to harvest soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: No nutrients needed to be added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're going to run a long outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about four months is a good run.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to run a long outdoor,
you want a top dress with some more
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay, could you tell us a little bit about
your soil making process?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making a live soil with biochar,
part of your expertise and background with
[SPEAKER_00]: the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us that process and how you're
selecting ingredients for your live soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that comes to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as a grower, you try everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our living soil actually probably has more
peat moss in it per bag than any other
[SPEAKER_01]: super soil out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is organic and created to also help the
micro growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa is a really good product also,
but I just prefer the peat as a grower and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's got their own choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use only 100% organic and naturally
collected amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start with micro and macro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do three different teas that we brew
and there's a certain order that we add
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been a test because then we
test the soils and see what the runoff is,
[SPEAKER_01]: see what's not staying, what is staying
for different stages of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first brew, we start with the fish
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fish emulsion is what speeds up that
year long process that Mother Nature needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through after a fire because they
needed to speed that process up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we harvest every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have a new soil ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes and the beneficial bacteria
that grow in the fish emulsion is the
[SPEAKER_01]: first tea that we start and we slowly add
the macro nutrients after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way from crustacean, alfalfa meal,
glacier silt, green sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use brown and black compost from
Ole Mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very reputable company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, you watch your
compost go from colored to brown to black
[SPEAKER_01]: finally when it's ready to go and that's
all that is because we want you to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to only water your whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have food in the beginning and
you got to have food available at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm hearing you say is brown and
black compost, one's a little more hotter
[SPEAKER_00]: than the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: One will affect your plant a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the black compost is now broken
down and ready for your plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for the microbes to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: As your microbes are feeding on that
compost in our soil, your brown compost is
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you're switching into flower,
it's breaking down that high phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: baguano, which is what the cannabis plant
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra flower power, I like to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time to learn when to do your
compost and stuff, but you kind of took
[SPEAKER_01]: that out of the thought process by using
both composts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we're really excited to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been just not even two weeks now
since we transplanted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're following, taking data and we'll get
you the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you trusted me.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be at your door every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make sure we get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are across all the T's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are definitely across all the T's.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes we add towards the end
because they'll eat everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have living soil, you don't want
to flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear people talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to drown your microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to wash those microbes out
because they're doing the last of their
[SPEAKER_01]: life trying to get that phosphorus out,
trying to get the nitrogen out because you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want your cannabis to sparkle and
crackle when you light it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want those microbes to eat up
everything that's left in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use in our own farm sugar finishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're organic extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make three different extracts depending
on the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We crush the biochar into a powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add this with three different natural
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you water your last two weeks of the
flowering cycle, that powder does what
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother Nature wanted it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works its way through your soil and
takes out all that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grabs that all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not available to your microbes or
your plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's left?
[SPEAKER_01]: The sugar and the natural extracts that we
use, the organic extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry, huckleberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those microbes have to feed on is that
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few other items that we use that
I don't want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are listed on the product,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just leaves nothing else in the soil
but natural sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add natural sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how sticky honey is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, feed your plant honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how sticky your buds are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay, what else, outside of what you've
mentioned already, are you putting in your
[SPEAKER_00]: super soil, your live soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, mammoth microbes is the last.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing soils for other cannabis
growers and hemp growers that want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: those microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of microbes out there to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different cultivators of those
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually adjusting per farm,
if they ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the compost, there is a little
bit of that brown and black compost in the
[SPEAKER_01]: teas, but very little of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually add most of that to the super
soil at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's five different earthworm castings
that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them go in the teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of them are added to the super soil
by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from high phosphorus,
bat guano, low phos, calcium calmeg.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use ground up oyster shells in it,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help the pH a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother nature, the biochar actually pHs
for every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think how many plants start up after a
forest fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't just a pine tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't just a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be all the way across.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some non-organic growers that are
using a chemical-based nutrients that use
[SPEAKER_01]: our biochar, because it does work,
but they add these teas in between that to
[SPEAKER_01]: help replace the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stay organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of your customers that you're
providing your biochar, your soil to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're in different areas,
regions, or growing differently,
[SPEAKER_00]: say outdoors, or if it's in a greenhouse
or indoors, what are some of the changes
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're having to make or that they're
wanting, maybe even for certain strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're running?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those changes that you would do
for your live soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the live soil, the first change that I
try and do, I don't play with the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I play with the amount of biochar,
the amount of perlite, the amount of peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll play with that a little bit,
but as far as the grow, if they're on a
[SPEAKER_01]: drip system, most of my grows are watering
once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a professional grow, that's a lot of
labor, not being used on better things
[SPEAKER_01]: than holding a watering wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, when it comes down to the
gardeners already using it, it will change
[SPEAKER_01]: on just the amount of biochar that's
added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some soils, heavy clay soils, 20,
30% biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a whole group of farmers that grow
indoor fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're running their mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using it about 30%, which is even
more than most cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We adjust it per what their soil medium,
whether they're going to use a soilless or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using our live soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't adjust the recipe only because I
think as being a chef for 15 years for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilton, I've got the mix down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Alfredo sauce pretty knocked
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to have my buddy over for
dinner to try my Alfredo sauce if I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't already fed it to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own family and we use our
biochar and our vegetables, my mother's
[SPEAKER_01]: houseplants, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you made a change per strain or maybe
if a customer has asked you or do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: of say a strain, if it's Blue Dream or
blueberry, that by tweaking your formula a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is for the strain, strain
specific that you get a different result
[SPEAKER_00]: or get that strain to reach its full
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would those changes be?
[SPEAKER_01]: A pretty well known strain that everybody
knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way with like say Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a Blue Dream cut for about seven
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody loves their Blue Dream,
but we have a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla Glue number four, I actually use
it as one of my father's or not Gorilla
[SPEAKER_01]: Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have changed it a bit because there are
certain strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's land-raised strains that have not
been altered that come from other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different minerals on every part
of this rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had to adjust depending on ... We
got a couple growers that grow Gorilla
[SPEAKER_01]: Glue number four strictly for edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've backed off about half of our biochar
and ingredients in our last tea for that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular strain because anybody can grow
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in a mud puddle and it
would probably grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do adjust them because why am I going
to have you pay for a full product when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not putting all that in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need it for certain strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one, God's Gift, very easily
grown, very low nutrients, Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, then on the other side, we got some
land-raised strains, Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be a 13-week strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going to need phosphorus a
little bit longer than everybody else,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you don't want to smoke
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you actually want some density to your
flower, you got to kick up that low-foss
[SPEAKER_01]: in the beginning of flowering to make sure
you actually get a bud instead of just ...
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: At your presentation today, what are some
of the key aspects you'd like to cover
[SPEAKER_01]: again?
[SPEAKER_01]: What struck your fancy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main takeaways from where I spoke,
and very important, it varies per state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every state's different, but the main
takeaway is you have to plan for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be change, change,
change, and you have to plan, plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phasing your build-out or your planning is
important because the future is unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: and uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people that are building out to a
large capacity want to phase that build,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's unforeseen, and you want to
plan for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's using mobile structures,
or not knowing if your county or zoning
[SPEAKER_00]: will allow you to do extraction,
or will put a moratorium on that area,
[SPEAKER_00]: or limit your extraction to the market
itself changing, and suddenly,
[SPEAKER_00]: flower might be extremely competitive,
and now you want to build a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a launch edible line or a topical
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much is unforeseen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main takeaway is plan for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a lot of change, and you have
to forecast for that, and always keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another big one from my conference
my presentation is all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: government agencies and their regulations,
and how you have to abide by them all,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're all different, and they all
have their own requirements, and it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it challenging, and those can change as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking for a site or starting
your business, you have to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration your local authority,
and the state, the city, the county,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean air, health department, department
of ecology, planning department,
[SPEAKER_00]: fire marshal, your neighbors, and those
are all going to vary depending on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different county will have different
requirements, and even one of the things I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to talk more on, and we didn't,
was the hoop houses, and how in my county
[SPEAKER_00]: that's considered a temporary structure,
but they didn't have a definition for what
[SPEAKER_00]: a hoop house was a year ago, and in some
other counties, they don't consider a hoop
[SPEAKER_00]: house a structure, and now the clean air
agency has come in, and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate us being able to grow in a hoop
house, this temporary structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're wanting to police if you don't
have a hoop house, or you're not growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was March last month of this year,
you're not able to now grow in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the clean air agency, which is in
Spokane County.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of their own authority,
and they're not a planning department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that you think the county
would be policing and telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can do in a structure,
and you have this other government agency
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in, and we had to file an exemption
to be able to grow in these temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: structures, and we're not exempt of
anything, and that's a yearly now fee I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pay, and they want us to give them
our my harvest schedules, which is putting
[SPEAKER_00]: my team at risk, and there's proprietary
information there, and in another county,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not even have a clean air
agency in that county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoop houses aren't even considered a
temporary structure, or a structure at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, so all of that is gonna play a huge
role in where you're gonna build,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what your plan is, and get yourself up
to success, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing all your homework is basically a
large one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adaptation, you gotta be open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another main takeaway is, and I feel that
this drastically, is your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever my budget was, I failed at that,
and now for me, it's just double it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be so many unforeseen costs
that you cannot plan on, or you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine, and so you have to, it's just
really hard to get your budget down for
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're working with, so that was a
huge one for me, is just whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: think your budget is, double that budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be unforeseen things,
and things you're gonna be required to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: and new licenses and permits, and
government agencies coming in trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a piece of the pie, like the clean air
agency, and so yeah, those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: takeaways, mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan, plan, plan, do your homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your budget, whatever you think you need,
you're gonna need more, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're dealing with your contractors,
roofers, electricians, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, this is new to all of us,
the cannabis industry commercial at this
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, especially to the government
agencies, so we're all on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical learning curve, and they're not
gonna know how to design a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna know where you need
power, and why, and how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your architect's not gonna know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your head grower, and the way he envisions
his system, or his method, he has to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with this architect, with the electrician,
and so there's just, everybody's really on
[SPEAKER_00]: a large vertical learning scale,
which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's learning, and that's another
reason for all the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they learn and figure out what's going
on, there'll be changes that will be for
[SPEAKER_00]: the positive, and for the negative,
to a business owner, or to a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the county, to the city, but I think
those are the main takeaways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it's been, as I'm indoor and
outdoor, I help with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: grows, and the Clean Air Act that they put
together, and it's gonna happen in every
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be some states that don't
care, and there's gonna be some that three
[SPEAKER_01]: or four different agencies pop up and they
go, you know, I mean, really, a hoop
[SPEAKER_01]: house, I mean, there's cattle farms that
are putting off more CO2 into the air than
[SPEAKER_01]: we could ever think of doing, and are they
getting charged by the acre, or are they
[SPEAKER_01]: even getting charged for Clean Air?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it's just kinda,
it really hit a lot of farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're struggling, and so I can understand
them wanting to get their piece of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pie, but they could've, you know,
give your state five years, give your
[SPEAKER_01]: investors five years, because people are
putting out their entire life savings into
[SPEAKER_01]: these places, and there's more and more
things to keep popping up, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be, like Casey said,
have two times the amount in your
[SPEAKER_01]: investment book than what you're planning
on actually spending, because it changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll change next week, it's gonna change
again in the next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Month to month, it changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packaging rules, labeling rules,
security rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can set your main game plan up,
but definitely leave some quotations for
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptation on it, because it changes,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the panels that I enjoyed,
and it was, it was today, it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of what we do at Contender
Gardens is the R&D and the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, and running these strains in
different environments, and seeing where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get the best of the best,
and what we're looking for, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bag appeal, the vigorous growth,
the resistance to pathogens and insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're really big on that research,
and I enjoyed the panel today on the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good to hear them talk about
autoflowers, feminized autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that becoming more and more of a
big deal, because in the past it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, in the world, but in the U.S.,
and the gentleman that spoke, Mr. Loud,
[SPEAKER_00]: did say how he wouldn't even consider or
look at feminized autoflowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not too long ago, a couple years
ago, but how he's looking and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: things a little differently now from going
to a greenhouse and talking to another
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, and that's been the truth for me
as well, where, you know, autoflowers
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't really interesting, and now we're
seeing the breeding and the autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have now to work with,
the stock has changed, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you can get two or three times your
canopy in a season when before it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really an option or you wouldn't consider
it, I mean, that's huge, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really doubling up your yield and
doubling up your sales, and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do them at two locations this season,
the autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already sprouted them, and we have
more going in, so I'm really excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: run them, and I have interest in perhaps
providing some of the seed stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: these autoflowers, to some of our other
fellow farmers in Washington State,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you see more and more of them
running them and wanting to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: second, third crop in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of potential there, and I'm glad
they touched on the feminized autoflower
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, because it is an up-and-coming
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at first not so happy with them
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a breeder myself, but I had fortunate
enough the last couple years to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: run some pretty decent strains of
autoflowers, and I'll tell you what,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be a part of my grow from now on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll never always go,
because I love the propagation process of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, but definitely for that third
run, you got space, and you need canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: space to fill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely, 20-some years ago,
I would say fill it in with your
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gotten a lot better, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first seeds I had, I wasn't so
impressed, but now the breeders that are
[SPEAKER_01]: working with those are getting a lot more
reputable, a lot more time under their
[SPEAKER_01]: belt, and they're a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be a game-changer,
and you'll see a huge push and evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: with feminized autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers in my state are now using them to
fill their canopy, or their rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: or their cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just plant them in between their
full-season plants, or where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants laid out, and then you'll
just see those come in and just sprout
[SPEAKER_00]: their entire field earlier to get that
extra crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see the higher-potency
autoflowers, the bigger yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the denser bud as the breeders,
and we have moved forward on this project,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the demand for them is apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that I think we have all known
just from breeders in the past and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders today that breeders have
bottlenecked a lot of strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so all these varieties and types have
gone away because we have found things we
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and used those to breed,
and kind of took the best of the best to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with, and so we have less of a
selection today than we did 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders will acknowledge this and
understand that that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some pros and cons to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we get some really good hybrids
and the best of the best with today's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and the stock that comes from it,
but at the same time, we've left behind a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of types that we might not have
anymore, or don't have access to,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're forgotten about or not used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm popping a couple seeds out of my seed
bank this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to get home and see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted a 1970s Amsterdam haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was smuggled out of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm popping the beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that comes to mind for me,
and these aren't really strains that are
[SPEAKER_00]: our land racer or ancient or stuff you
can't find, but I remember a mazar was
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I was really into that we
got our hands on early on in the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a G blue that we really
liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I haven't seen around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an old ancient strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in early 2000s as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that G blue was something that
we would love to get our hands on again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the G13 cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 was one of my first strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, ordering seeds,
peeking out the window, watching for your
[SPEAKER_01]: local mailman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you got a badge on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our parents maybe would be
somebody to ask on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who's substantially older than me
that was into the scene and now doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: hear or has not found that strain again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inexistent, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think I'm still on the younger
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For when I started cultivating and up till
this point, I didn't grow up consuming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a kid, 70s, wasn't even alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of strains that I
wouldn't even have any idea that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think I'm still on the younger
generation.
