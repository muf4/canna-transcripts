[SPEAKER_02]: Music My name is Kat Donnelly and I'm the
CEO of Azentive and we are a wellness and
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability company and we happen to
have a beautiful plasma light in our
[SPEAKER_02]: toolkit but we're not a lighting company
so when you talk to us we might sound kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of weird how we talk to you because we're
going to encourage you to grow outdoors if
[SPEAKER_02]: you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to encourage you to use other
nature to the extent that you can so we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't some people think that's weird but
we think that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Sunshine Johnson of Sunbolt
Grown and I farm in Red Crest in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 10,000 square feet of cultivation
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dry farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use any water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've added I've transplanted and added
water and I've also transplanted and added
[SPEAKER_01]: no water and I don't see any difference
and I think it's actually better not to
[SPEAKER_01]: use any water at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow primarily from seed and I have I
have one clone selection the loopy fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: but generally it's all from seed and I
just do that one crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do any depths or anything like
that but I do have a home grow and in my
[SPEAKER_01]: home grow is where I do my research and
development and I tinker just a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: but for my production farm it's I want to
be as natural as possible that if that
[SPEAKER_01]: means not also not adding any fertilizer
to the field and being very conscious
[SPEAKER_01]: about what inputs I do have because I
believe that it is nature that perfects
[SPEAKER_01]: what I grow and not me as a farmer and in
this way I by using these growing methods
[SPEAKER_01]: I can capture the the terroir which is the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have old growth redwoods that grow next
to my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a farming community where there's
other farm activities going on and I also
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I just I really I really really like
what nature does to my plants so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why I use cover crops and flip those cover
crops and use that as my fertilizer so
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Jeff Loewenfels I've got three
books the teaming series and I believe
[SPEAKER_07]: that that this is a great group because
what we talk about are the three things
[SPEAKER_07]: that I believe we all need to have the
three legs of the stool genetics,
[SPEAKER_07]: light, and soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the three things that you got to
concentrate on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get those locked down you have
the best medicine you can possibly make.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Sundarajan Mutialu.
[SPEAKER_08]: My nickname is Sin but lately it's been
turned to Sun by this gentleman and I'm a
[SPEAKER_08]: technology evangelist but my whole goal is
biomimicry is if we are going to come up
[SPEAKER_08]: with technology how do we meld it with
nature how do we emulate nature and so my
[SPEAKER_08]: probably my most significant strategic
partner and probably the one that means
[SPEAKER_08]: the most to me is Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Hawk Marsden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I own a company called Ucantatou
Educational Nursery we provide clones and
[SPEAKER_06]: strains for basically 80% of the market
that's out there right now started in my
[SPEAKER_06]: garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: When growers get their first 90 days to
come and accumulate all their strains for
[SPEAKER_06]: the recreational garden in most cases they
either came to Rainbow Farms here in
[SPEAKER_06]: Portland or they came to our place out in
Sheridan and got them from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been collecting genetics since 1978
and I have seeds from just about all of
[SPEAKER_06]: the original classic strains and that's
what I prefer to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know taking we do a lot of propagation
we do a lot of breeding and we take
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics that come from other experienced
growers that have extreme medical
[SPEAKER_06]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a recreational grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a medical grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a die-hard medical grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the medical program ever came to an end
I'd be that last guy fighting okay because
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the way I've seen the
industry grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the way that I've seen
growers take basic strains that had such
[SPEAKER_06]: great medicinal value to them and diminish
them to nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ineffective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Improper growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we bring the new guys out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys who really want to learn how to
grow and they come out and they learn our
[SPEAKER_06]: methods.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take with one plant what you do with
50 plants and most of you probably grow in
[SPEAKER_06]: three gallon five gallon pots if you're
doing an indoor garden you know and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: quick cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a three and a half to a four and
a half month vegetation period and a 60
[SPEAKER_06]: day and I'll do anybody that you produce
with one plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard a myth around Portland that
there's a guy who does five point nine six
[SPEAKER_06]: pounds per one plant and I am that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying that to brag but I believe
in keeping the genetics around.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm using one seed in order to
propagate 200 plants that will be all the
[SPEAKER_06]: babies that come from that and then I take
that plant and I put it into flour I've
[SPEAKER_06]: actually matured it enough for it to
totally outline its entire terpene profile
[SPEAKER_06]: which gives you the full medical benefit
of the plant instead of a minute part of
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you allow a plant to only get a foot
tall or two feet tall you're not giving it
[SPEAKER_06]: the ability to make that road map.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now if you're going to grow outside you
know then I agree every natural resource
[SPEAKER_06]: that is available to you should be
utilized instead of all the synthetics and
[SPEAKER_06]: things that are going in because when
those synthetics go into your buds it
[SPEAKER_06]: diminishes the medical quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you become a grower to begin with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably 80 percent of you that are
sitting in here right now started off as
[SPEAKER_06]: medical growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were a medical grower show me your
hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're still a medical grower keep your
hand up okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference in your buds now
compared to what you were producing back
[SPEAKER_06]: when you were medical isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Something disappeared as soon as that
recreational law came in and one thing was
[SPEAKER_06]: deleted from 90 percent of the growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: The heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: The heart went out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as the heart goes out that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you have to depend on what the plant
can do and how quick you can do it and how
[SPEAKER_06]: much you can make as quick as you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have this overabundance and we're
worried about whether or not we can ship
[SPEAKER_06]: it out of state and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a perfect idea to do what you know
what to do with all that abundance.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a lot of patients in this state
that no longer have growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody cares anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I'm the guy who's gonna fight for
that you know to get the patients taken
[SPEAKER_06]: care of and to keep the strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prime example the Black Buddha.
[SPEAKER_06]: I beat prostate cancer three times in five
years with RSO suppositories made from the
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Buddha.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Black Buddha were two land races the
Hindu Buddha that come from the base of
[SPEAKER_06]: the Hindu Mountains and the Black Domina
which is a predominant land race strain of
[SPEAKER_06]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: In crossing those two genetics we were
able to develop the Black Buddha which we
[SPEAKER_06]: then in turn sold the greenhouse seeds in
Amsterdam who mass produce it so that it
[SPEAKER_06]: can be turned around and sold in seed form
to everybody around the around the world
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to produce that plant and the
one thing is Leafly does not give you
[SPEAKER_06]: accurate information as to what your
strains can actually do for a patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much research did you do when you were
a medical grower towards the strains that
[SPEAKER_06]: you were originally growing and turned
your back on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to bring the land races back get
back to the classics and begin again build
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole new roadmap and I hope that it
through his electronics and my growing
[SPEAKER_06]: techniques and genetics and this guy's
soil to be able to turn around and take
[SPEAKER_06]: you back to 1960 when the idea of what
cannabis could really inspire medically
[SPEAKER_06]: started coming forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't just about the hippies getting
stoned.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not old enough to remember too many of
the hippies I'm in my 50s you know but I
[SPEAKER_06]: do remember in the 70s and in the early
80s watching all the teenagers around me
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking and the difference that I saw then
was there was a love of the plant and when
[SPEAKER_06]: I came to Oregon I came here I didn't come
here to be a grower I didn't even come
[SPEAKER_06]: here to use cannabis I came here because
Oregon was an assisted suicide state.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had two weeks left to live and I came
here to die.
[SPEAKER_06]: A guy came into my hospital room and gave
me a cookie and then he came back the next
[SPEAKER_06]: day and he gave me another cookie that man
changed my life changed my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I burned pot fields my first two years in
the United States Marine Corps I burned
[SPEAKER_06]: pot fields in Columbia that was my job to
stand there with a flamethrower and burn
[SPEAKER_06]: pot but I wasn't allowed to burn the coca
plants on the other side of the road and
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not joking you know it was that that
was my job and and you know what I didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: have a problem with doing that because
what I saw in 19 in the 70s going through
[SPEAKER_06]: high school and everything everybody who
was smoking pot was quitting school you
[SPEAKER_06]: know they weren't finishing school you
know they were all hanging out in the park
[SPEAKER_06]: and things like that but nothing ever
dawned on me to the fact that it wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: that they quit school because of the pot
they quit school because of the school
[SPEAKER_06]: they quit school because of the teaching
or they quit school because you know I can
[SPEAKER_06]: go for hours but but it's but the idea is
the land races the the original footprints
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the only way we can get back to
where we were and that's where you guys as
[SPEAKER_06]: growers once again find your love of the
plant instead of the love of the profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish we had five hours because every
one of these people on the panel have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of very very very important things to
say so please look them up after if you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get all your answers I guess we will
never get all our answers but if we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get all the questions answered today so I
just want to throw out a question to the
[SPEAKER_02]: audience does anyone know what biomimicry
is?
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah back here you raised your hand first
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly so the definition of biomimicry
it's a noun and it is the imitation of
[SPEAKER_02]: natural biological designs or processes in
engineering or invention and for us for us
[SPEAKER_02]: as a company that's very very important
there's examples everywhere there's wind
[SPEAKER_02]: turbines that are based on the humpback
whales their their design there's
[SPEAKER_02]: self-cooling buildings based on the
architecture of termite mounds there's
[SPEAKER_02]: bullet trains based on the aerodynamics of
the Kingfisher lots and lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: examples and we think this is very
important they're everywhere and so that
[SPEAKER_02]: those are you that are growing and living
soil outdoor in the Sun using regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: methods you're already doing this because
we know we all know in this room you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably wouldn't be here today if you
didn't know that mother nature is the
[SPEAKER_02]: smartest engineer on this planet she knows
what to do she has it figured out why are
[SPEAKER_02]: we trying to dial it in so that's that's
kind of the point of today is mother
[SPEAKER_02]: nature's figured it out so we're gonna get
do one question from each panel member and
[SPEAKER_02]: I might cut them off just in case just to
let you guys know just so we can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: things moving because we do want to be
sure to open it up to the audience so
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll start with sunshine
[SPEAKER_02]: sunshine we we know that land races are
tied to their native bio regions and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know not everyone is as lucky as you to
grow right there where the redwoods are
[SPEAKER_02]: kissing your farm can you talk a little
bit about the Sun and the intelligence of
[SPEAKER_02]: lights and the connection to the cosmos we
talked a little bit and what excites you
[SPEAKER_02]: about having the indoor Sun in your world
I was actually been super hesitant about
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor lighting and but I do want to take
cuttings on my seed plants and I do want
[SPEAKER_01]: to preserve my genetics so there was
always this feeling of okay now if I can
[SPEAKER_01]: do some kind of a hybrid if I can get the
natural Sun in there and I overwinter and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a number of years in my home
grow doing just that where I produce a
[SPEAKER_01]: food crop essentially I love having fresh
buds six months out of the year I use it
[SPEAKER_01]: in all my cuisine I do infused honey
infused oils I juice raw bud and I value
[SPEAKER_01]: it for that in my home grow and at the
same time for my genetics so I have been
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering what to do about this because
when I it's true when I see plants growing
[SPEAKER_01]: under artificial lights my first thought
is those plants are being grown in prison
[SPEAKER_01]: it just something about it just doesn't
feel right to me and with that it also has
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with the quality of the light
because when you have sunlight which
[SPEAKER_01]: travels eight minutes across the sky
you're getting a more coherent light that
[SPEAKER_01]: that path is following I forget what the
distance is from the Sun to the earth but
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it takes a little over eight
minutes whereas when you're using electric
[SPEAKER_01]: light bulbs that light can be incoherent
it's it's very it's it's a different kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of light and light is intelligence light
is the high it's the most form it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: it's mostly it's the biggest form of
communication used on the planet all the
[SPEAKER_01]: little all the little in microbes things
anyway in the ocean light but light is
[SPEAKER_01]: important and there is an intelligence
behind the light so I have been wondering
[SPEAKER_01]: about what can I do for my genetics to
keep them as close as as close as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: to their truth I guess if you want to call
it that and I I was wondering okay what am
[SPEAKER_01]: I gonna do about this well I was I finally
lit up my room with the Sun on demand and
[SPEAKER_01]: it definitely made a difference I was like
okay I think I have an answer to my
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery I think I have a future in this
and I can do this and I've been using it
[SPEAKER_01]: for just a few months really not not that
long and I've been impressed with the the
[SPEAKER_01]: health of the plants and the way it
responds it's no substitute for for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun but it it helps me with overwintering
and maintaining my my genetics and also
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight is important too because if you
look at say the way how it relates to to
[SPEAKER_01]: your to war to your native place and where
you're at for instance here in Oregon you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow amazing amazing wine and the quality
of those wine has everything to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of of the Sun and the way the
angle that it hits the part partly clouded
[SPEAKER_01]: skies the refraction of the Sun from those
from those clouds and the way how you
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway it's a it's a beautiful thing here
in Oregon a lot of it has to do with your
[SPEAKER_01]: latitude and and and where where you're at
so yeah it indoor light as well the other
[SPEAKER_01]: interest that I have in indoor light is
looking at the different frequencies and
[SPEAKER_01]: how can you use light frequency for for
healing and for medicine for your plants
[SPEAKER_07]: and also for yourself well you know I'm
old enough to remember when people started
[SPEAKER_07]: growing indoors and it was exciting for
cannabis let's start there I mean I
[SPEAKER_07]: remember when people were starting to grow
indoors anything and we had these terrible
[SPEAKER_07]: purple lights and you could drive around a
neighborhood and you knew who was growing
[SPEAKER_07]: plants indoors and who wasn't growing
plants indoors and and everybody had the
[SPEAKER_07]: same color light it was only one kind of
light that you could buy for growing
[SPEAKER_07]: plants and then somebody discovered the
difference between you know the the cool
[SPEAKER_07]: white fluorescent bulbs on a warm white
lesson bulbs etc etc etc but all of us
[SPEAKER_07]: learned how to grow outdoors you learned
with your parents or your grandparents
[SPEAKER_07]: outdoors and then we all started to get
into the cannabis world and the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis world when I was a kid was
designed to be clandestine and secretive
[SPEAKER_07]: and indoor and quiet and so you had to go
to lights and so we use whatever lights we
[SPEAKER_07]: had and of course the minute you go
indoors and you go away from the sunlight
[SPEAKER_07]: you've got a different plant blah blah
blah and and you breed the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: differently and so it's not just the light
gee we need shorter plants and so let's go
[SPEAKER_07]: to Afghanistan let's get some Afghani and
mix it in with these taller plants let's
[SPEAKER_07]: make some smaller plants and all of a
sudden we end up with a plant that is
[SPEAKER_07]: designed to be grown indoors because
that's the only place you can grow it and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's the only reason why you look at the
genetics of that plant we want to be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to grow something indoors you know as
quickly as successfully as possible when
[SPEAKER_07]: in fact the real place to be growing is
outdoors under the Sun with real soil and
[SPEAKER_07]: real microbes and all natural conditions
and so we're stuck and then we add in the
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll call it the miracle grow hydro
general hydroponic syndrome you know where
[SPEAKER_07]: they've got a product they want to make
you use it they convince you to use it
[SPEAKER_07]: they show you spectrums that are you know
but they convince you that they're the
[SPEAKER_07]: best you know and then you run into a Sun
on demand type situation and all of a
[SPEAKER_07]: sudden you go wait a second I could be
indoors and have everything that I needed
[SPEAKER_07]: outdoors because I got a Sun on demand and
I can I can pretend I'm in Durban South
[SPEAKER_07]: Africa indoors and dial in the light like
it is in Durban Durban South Africa in
[SPEAKER_07]: theory I can get soil microbes like they
are in Durban and all of a sudden I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: growing Durban poison the way they grow it
in South Africa and that's the way you
[SPEAKER_07]: would do it outdoors right you'd go get
the right stuff you'd be going in the
[SPEAKER_07]: right lights there and so you know we got
to just adjust if you're gonna grow
[SPEAKER_07]: indoors grow outdoors indoors don't grow
indoors because it's easy you know because
[SPEAKER_07]: this is how we develop the system so that
the plant will fit indoors that's not the
[SPEAKER_07]: way to go and then at the end of it all of
course is that the light and land race are
[SPEAKER_07]: you know they're like this and terror you
know the Durban poison that you grow in
[SPEAKER_07]: Durban South Africa is going to be
different than the Durban poison you grow
[SPEAKER_07]: in Grants Pass period but if you can dial
in the light the right way etc etc etc and
[SPEAKER_07]: and and to go back and just tie it all
together this idea that we adjusted our
[SPEAKER_07]: plants so that we could grow it indoors we
adjusted our lights so that we could grow
[SPEAKER_07]: them indoors has resulted in a plant
that's not what we really want it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: the medical cannabis that we started out
thinking we were going to get it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: design it's a Walt Disney you know Ford
Motor Company Scott's miracle grow
[SPEAKER_07]: designed plant one size fits all if you
can change it a little bit fine you can
[SPEAKER_07]: paint it different colors but it's one
plant fits all it's all got Afghani you
[SPEAKER_07]: know and it's all designed to fit indoors
once we start to figure out how to design
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant for medicine forget about the
fact that we're indoors we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_07]: winning and this light lets us do that
teaming with microbes lets you do that you
[SPEAKER_06]: know and and we're there we've got all the
tools that we need so I put the light in
[SPEAKER_06]: my greenhouse and I have a couple of 25 by
40 hoop houses and I do black tarpon but
[SPEAKER_06]: it's white on the inside black on the
outside and I sectioned off three sections
[SPEAKER_06]: I put in three LEDs in one section and put
in the same strains as what I put in under
[SPEAKER_06]: four Gavitas and then I put in Sun on
Demand now the first thing that I noticed
[SPEAKER_06]: is in most indoor grows the first
formation that you get is the crown of the
[SPEAKER_06]: bud it gives you a nice little rounded off
crown that's when all the hairs start
[SPEAKER_06]: coming up and you know that you're in the
beginning of the budding cycle correct
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody seen that before okay but with
the Sun on Demand it came up just like it
[SPEAKER_06]: does in the outdoor part of our garden the
bud formation began like where it's a very
[SPEAKER_06]: widespread in the hairs and and and the
body buildup of it and all the flowers
[SPEAKER_06]: that are growing underneath it are growing
no different than when I grow them in my
[SPEAKER_06]: field in the middle of the summer you know
and we've we just finished our our first
[SPEAKER_06]: winter crop ever at the farm out here
because we just we had no heat we you know
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't even want to know the story
behind that but but we you know we kept
[SPEAKER_06]: the genetics alive through the winter and
when these guys brought out the Sun on
[SPEAKER_06]: Demand and we put it in there we said okay
let's do a comparison and it was very
[SPEAKER_06]: apparent this Wednesday when we had a
group of people come out to the farm and
[SPEAKER_06]: you could see the same three strains
underneath three different lights and what
[SPEAKER_06]: the production value was on the Afghan
Inferno we probably got more than
[SPEAKER_06]: three-quarters of a pound more in a 20
gallon pot then it but this was done in a
[SPEAKER_06]: five gallon okay we did this in a five
gallon but you would have thought that it
[SPEAKER_06]: grew in a 20 gallon pot but under the
gavitas I got a plant that was like you
[SPEAKER_06]: know like a five gallon pot you know we
got maybe a pound in a pound and an eighth
[SPEAKER_06]: at the most off of that plant and under
the LED we got less than a pound we were
[SPEAKER_06]: closer to three-quarters of a pound and
the quality of the bud was each one of
[SPEAKER_06]: them was a little bit different the Sun on
Demand was the most effective medically
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and and and that's the big thing
is it's one of the triggers that we use
[SPEAKER_06]: for adult seizures the one that's under
the LED didn't have its the desired effect
[SPEAKER_06]: the ones under the gavita came close but
they weren't there the one under the Sun
[SPEAKER_06]: on Demand no seizures since that day so so
so that tells me that going in in that
[SPEAKER_06]: direction was was the best thing for us
and now we're actually cleaning out the
[SPEAKER_06]: entire hoop house and and we're gonna do
Sun on Demand and in the whole thing the
[SPEAKER_06]: footprint of this plant is or of this
light I I've never seen a light that can
[SPEAKER_06]: penetrate through and penetrate down into
the soil and not overheat the room and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know causing airflow conditions and
everything else and you know with proper
[SPEAKER_06]: co2 being instituted at the same time you
could have you know it your your growth
[SPEAKER_06]: abilities are exponential so
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel a little sheepish because this is
not intended to be a commercial for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun on Demand maybe I would bring it back
to another topic you know we're really
[SPEAKER_02]: really telling you the truth when we say
if you can grow outside please do use the
[SPEAKER_02]: natural resources so please don't take
this as a commercial for the Sun on Demand
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just as a company looking for
biomimicry ways to support those beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor growths so I'm going to bring it
back to something that I've been thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about a lot and you know we've been
watching this industry for a while it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very important to us as a company and I
think to most of you in this room that the
[SPEAKER_02]: small original farmers get to maintain
their lifestyle get to maintain their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and what they're doing so I'm going
to kick a question I think I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: start it with Jeff what what do you think
is the best way we can preserve the small
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer and the small grower and stop this
from being something where anhyzer bush
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in or an insert X big company comes
in and takes over how are we going to work
[SPEAKER_07]: together to preserve that well you know my
standard my standard answer is we grow the
[SPEAKER_07]: best medical cannabis we possibly can and
we'll win you know because that's not what
[SPEAKER_07]: you know anhyzer bush is going to do
they're going to grow the most efficient
[SPEAKER_07]: cheapest standardized stuff you know it's
going to be just like the beers versus the
[SPEAKER_07]: craft beers you've all heard that stuff
you know and obviously that's true and I
[SPEAKER_07]: and I still stand by that answer but I you
know the more I think about it I think we
[SPEAKER_07]: we have approached this whole medical
stuff and recreational stuff from the
[SPEAKER_07]: viewpoint of trying to convince people we
thought didn't didn't want to do this and
[SPEAKER_07]: so we came up with this idea that you know
we'll smoke and pay for your schools you
[SPEAKER_07]: know and so we we sort of went around and
call it all the states have this thing
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to raise taxes this is great
it's going to be terrific you don't have
[SPEAKER_07]: to smoke weed but we're going to raise tax
money by letting other people smoke weed
[SPEAKER_07]: and so we ended up with this situation
where it's becoming untenable for
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensaries for individual growers to be
able to deal with the taxing situation
[SPEAKER_07]: that we've got that's been imposed upon us
because we wanted to legalize it and so we
[SPEAKER_07]: thought t this is a clever way to do it
well you know I think we've got to sit
[SPEAKER_07]: back now and figure a better way to do it
and and one of the things I've always
[SPEAKER_07]: thought we could do and I don't know how
you do it we don't use our political power
[SPEAKER_07]: the way we should we have a day 420 day
you know where we party where every single
[SPEAKER_07]: news journalist in the country wants to
write a story half of them do they all use
[SPEAKER_07]: the word marijuana you know we've talked
about this idea of using using that day to
[SPEAKER_07]: come up with you know this is the day
everybody switches and starts using
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis and doesn't use marijuana anymore
you know some political something other
[SPEAKER_07]: and maybe what we need to start doing is
say wait a second this taxing situation
[SPEAKER_07]: has gotten out of hand this is a plant you
don't tax tomato plants you don't tax
[SPEAKER_07]: marigolds you know why are we doing this
to ourselves and taxing the cannabis we
[SPEAKER_07]: want it legal we want to pay a fair share
sure but you know the tomato growers pay a
[SPEAKER_07]: little teeny tax they don't have a 280
situation and maybe what we need to do is
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out a way that everybody who goes
into a dispensary on August 1st or
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever the date is around this country
sends a note from the dispensary to you
[SPEAKER_07]: know whoever we need to identify and start
applying the kinds of pressure that we
[SPEAKER_07]: need to apply as a group we need to come
together to protect the individual farmer
[SPEAKER_07]: and individual dispensaries and and I
think we need to use our political power
[SPEAKER_07]: and we are not doing that we party we
don't power up and instead of partying up
[SPEAKER_07]: we need to power up we are the largest
single group I can think of in this
[SPEAKER_07]: country we have you know we have mega
people and non-mega people doesn't make a
[SPEAKER_07]: bit of difference we are united behind
this idea that we want to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis legally and not have the
government screwing around with us so
[SPEAKER_07]: that's just where I come from and the
unfortunate the unfortunate thing is you
[SPEAKER_07]: know that there are so many other problems
like the abortion problem and everything
[SPEAKER_07]: else that gets in the way of all of this
stuff at some point in time we got to come
[SPEAKER_07]: together and just say we can do this let's
do it so I don't know how we do it but
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody needs to organize it and put it
together and I'm too old to do it but
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe sunshine I will say that having
grown up in southern Humboldt back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day no one really had any money it was
during that time of not having money that
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually created our own institutions
we had our own we had our own community
[SPEAKER_01]: safety net safety net that we did it
ourselves and how we did it is we formed a
[SPEAKER_01]: community radio station that would tell us
when helicopters were flying we had the
[SPEAKER_01]: material community center we had a health
care we still have these and we had
[SPEAKER_01]: community schools and we also have a
community credit union and over the period
[SPEAKER_01]: of the past 10 to 15 years with the green
rush we've seen a corruption of money in
[SPEAKER_01]: our community we've seen our nonprofits
actually have a difficult time and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping now that through our farms we can
return that back to our nonprofits the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that I faced with taxation as a
farmer is that and I knew I knew this
[SPEAKER_01]: going into it I'm like you're a farmer and
you are at the bottom everyone is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take take take to quote an Anthony B song
everyone wants to raid the barn no one
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to grow the corn and this is this is
a very real reality so what happens is the
[SPEAKER_01]: taxations get kicked down to us us as
farmers we are the credit for the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and we can't get credit everyone
is borrowing from us as farmers and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: very challenging so it comes back to the
taxation okay so the retailer wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: take 50% oh wait it's not quite 50 it's a
little more than 50 oh why because oh
[SPEAKER_01]: they're kicking the tax down to us and
this is true for all farmers across all
[SPEAKER_01]: industries but the government didn't
really see it that way there's been this
[SPEAKER_01]: concept of greed oh growers oh this whole
concept of oh they're making all this
[SPEAKER_01]: money and we have had to pay a cannabis
rate for everything across the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to the grow shop we have to pay
more for our beneficial insects than
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone else well yeah that's that's the
that's the question isn't it so it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge with taxation in California
right now they are looking at withholding
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivation tax till 2020 and that
will that will help but it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: important when we're thinking about our
companies and our farms and our businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: that our farms can represent a cause and
that cause can benefit the earth and
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit the world and so be thinking
because I was raised by activists we grew
[SPEAKER_01]: and we saved redwood trees we helped
indigenous people that's what we used our
[SPEAKER_01]: profit from from growing and that's the
same thing that I'm gonna do the other
[SPEAKER_08]: thing I want to add and Hawk is very
modest at his his the work that he's done
[SPEAKER_08]: he does it with with a very big heart and
he gives 75 85 percent of his money out he
[SPEAKER_08]: tries to work on about 20 or 10 percent of
the money that comes in the rest of it
[SPEAKER_08]: goes to his patients the rest goes out to
teach people how to grow to save their
[SPEAKER_08]: lives to save their children's lives so I
think it takes that kind of heart and
[SPEAKER_08]: that's what he's talking about is that
heart has to come back not just heart for
[SPEAKER_08]: yourself for your patients but heart for
that plant as well so I think when you
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about smaller farms you have to be
somewhat differentiate yourself on the
[SPEAKER_08]: marketplace you have to put your heart
into it and that's what's going to show
[SPEAKER_08]: that's what's going to show in the plant
it's going to reward you for having that
[SPEAKER_08]: heart and so I think with a small farmer
you've got to stop conforming and be more
[SPEAKER_08]: individual with what you have and love
yourself love the plants love your patient
[SPEAKER_08]: throw that love out it'll come back to you
in so many different ways I think that's
[SPEAKER_08]: the plight of the small farmer not to
conform okay
[SPEAKER_02]: so now's the time to open it up to the
audience I agree with you guys in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're talking about in terms of the
small farmer opening up regulation is only
[SPEAKER_05]: going to encourage big business to come in
280e as painful as it is for us prevents
[SPEAKER_05]: major pharmaceutical companies prevent
major alcohol companies from putting money
[SPEAKER_05]: into an industry where they're not going
to be able to make money as soon as those
[SPEAKER_05]: laws are lifted they're gonna be coming in
hungry as can be the only way we can
[SPEAKER_05]: survive is being individuals being true to
what we believe in having a cause putting
[SPEAKER_05]: something out there not necessarily even
the greatest bud but the greatest you know
[SPEAKER_05]: care for the environment degrees care for
our community that's how we can set
[SPEAKER_05]: ourselves apart and and actually do
something good besides grow great cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: and supply great patients with cannabis I
believe we do that but I think we should
[SPEAKER_05]: be coming together for better causes for
higher causes is what I like so I know it
[SPEAKER_03]: might vary a little bit because we're
collecting cannabis from Africa Thailand
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan a lot of different places but
kind of as sunshine was saying about
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon being a good place for wine and now
it's growing I am curious if anyone has
[SPEAKER_03]: any recommendations on what to look for as
far as property or environment or signs
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe the terroir might be something
to work with he's asking about looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: land here in Oregon to produce amazing
great cannabis and I would say too that
[SPEAKER_01]: historically Williams is has quite a long
history of farming there they have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of tradition and that's one place that I
would look at is where where do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the culture and the growing communities
and dry farming is amazing and they dry
[SPEAKER_01]: farm a lot of grapes here in Oregon and
they also have small vineyards here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon you got organs in between
Washington and California they just have
[SPEAKER_01]: these thousand acre vineyards but Oregon's
kept it small and there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a message for us in that in how
they do the wine here and and the dry
[SPEAKER_01]: farming as well so I would look also you
have an amazing volcanic soils here and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of those soils I mean if you're
looking at you have oceanic volcanics
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed in with terrestrial volcanics and
there's a lot of complexity in the soils
[SPEAKER_01]: so you have very good farming here for
sure and then looking at your you
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely want to be looking at your your
south face and and looking at that aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: and then as far as humidity and dryness
goes I grow where I have high humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: next to the river and I like that for my
terpene development and so that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: other part where if you're in a hotter
climate you might be getting drier air and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that drier air it could possibly
raise your potency but it may blow off
[SPEAKER_01]: some of your terpenes there's challenges
in growing in high humidity with mold and
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's also can be a problem if you're
trying to grow for flower but not so much
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're trying to grow for amazing whole
plant hash medicine that is really good so
[SPEAKER_06]: it just depends on on what you want to
produce Oregon is it is extremely unique
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the difference in number one
climate you know height elevation
[SPEAKER_06]: different regions get extreme amounts of
water and things like that I went out to
[SPEAKER_06]: we went out to Sheridan about three years
ago I was up in Oregon City the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between the water table how clean the
water was that we got to use there in
[SPEAKER_06]: comparison to what we had in Sheridan the
Sheridan property was you know our when
[SPEAKER_06]: you pH the water you got a you know
between a 5.8 to a 6.0 and that's straight
[SPEAKER_06]: up out of the creek you know and so that
means that the water table that's
[SPEAKER_06]: underneath my ground there is is you know
basically you know less than 6.2 in the pH
[SPEAKER_06]: level but you also need to pH your soil
out and things too to find out what levels
[SPEAKER_06]: you have there you know that's it that's
why hydroponic growers amaze me is because
[SPEAKER_06]: this plant never grew in a creek it never
grew in a river it never grew in a lake
[SPEAKER_06]: and it never grew in the frickin ocean
okay so I'm sorry it just never happened
[SPEAKER_06]: so disconnecting the plant with mother
earth you're losing that 25 to 30 percent
[SPEAKER_06]: of properties that normally you would get
from the microbes and bacterias that you
[SPEAKER_06]: get from the soils Oregon is rich with
medical ground I there's no other way to
[SPEAKER_06]: put it all the way up until 1934 a horse
could walk out to the edge of the field
[SPEAKER_06]: and eat a bud off of a plant and heal an
illness a cow could do the same thing
[SPEAKER_06]: sheep everything animals lived a lot
longer in the early 1900s because the
[SPEAKER_06]: animals went naturally to the hemp and the
cannabis that was growing freely you know
[SPEAKER_06]: so Oregon has its very own distinction in
the way the Sun comes through here and
[SPEAKER_06]: then the way the moisture comes through
here and the waves that it comes through
[SPEAKER_06]: enriches this soil so much and and it's
it's the idea of correctly using your
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor environment in order to produce
the best that you can you want to save
[SPEAKER_06]: your medical market okay the way to do it
is to think back to why you started
[SPEAKER_06]: growing in the first place you know and
and those original lessons that you
[SPEAKER_06]: learned forget the science and break it
down to the soil break it down to the Sun
[SPEAKER_06]: and break it down to your genetics make it
simple
[SPEAKER_02]: so I have a question for the audience how
many of you have any kind of supplemental
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting to support your farms not that
many yeah so how many of you are just
[SPEAKER_02]: growing just pure only Sun no supplemental
lighting whatsoever that's impressive
[SPEAKER_02]: that's impressive well I wanted to just
ask Sundarajan a quick question about the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between artificial lighting
whether that's high-pressure sodium LED
[SPEAKER_08]: metal halide and sunshine okay well that's
a long question but quickly yes of course
[SPEAKER_08]: that's like telling how quickly so
sunlight as sunshine described it coming
[SPEAKER_08]: here to earth is the energy source of the
whole world all of us everything right it
[SPEAKER_08]: creates that energy so we definitely as
Kat said want you to grow outdoors if you
[SPEAKER_08]: can but if you can't then doing with HPS
or LEDs is probably the worst thing you
[SPEAKER_08]: can do and the reason is and maybe HPS is
probably better than any of them which is
[SPEAKER_08]: probably crazy thing to do maybe a little
metal halide but that would be like
[SPEAKER_08]: feeding your children whatever they like
the most favorite thing all the time let's
[SPEAKER_08]: say it's just strawberries and that's all
you do is keep or potatoes you got I grew
[SPEAKER_08]: my children only on potatoes look at it
it's beautiful it's big look at how big my
[SPEAKER_08]: kid is six foot four eating potatoes well
does he get all the nutrients no so all
[SPEAKER_08]: these lights are working on about 23% of
the Sun spectrum not only the radiant flux
[SPEAKER_08]: but the electromagnetic flux meaning the
particles and the waveforms are not coming
[SPEAKER_08]: to your plant so you're you're really in
essence and to the microbes yes of course
[SPEAKER_08]: and so you want to be able to penetrate
down with the green light the green light
[SPEAKER_08]: they always poo poo green light so no the
Sun the plant reflects green light no it
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't it absorbs green light it allows
it to go through that's what allows the
[SPEAKER_08]: penetration so you want to activate your
microbes you want it to have this really
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful symbiotic relationship which is
what happens in the beautiful redwood
[SPEAKER_08]: trees here in Oregon right so that's the
kind of atmosphere that's what you want to
[SPEAKER_08]: set up in your grows indoors so when we
design the light we actually wanted full
[SPEAKER_08]: spectrum exactly every one of those
quarter wave eighth wave everything the
[SPEAKER_08]: Sun does to be available rather than one
specific margin and you're trying to guess
[SPEAKER_08]: it and so growers have tried to dial it in
well no there's no dialing it in that
[SPEAKER_08]: plants dialed it in you're just provided
it's something it's the one that's doing
[SPEAKER_08]: all the work not you so don't even think
you're doing that when you're doing
[SPEAKER_08]: something artificial and so now you got to
make up for just give me a few seconds so
[SPEAKER_08]: now you got to make up for biochemicals
because you can't give it everything just
[SPEAKER_08]: like we do now we don't take care of our
lower gut 70% of our immune system is the
[SPEAKER_08]: error so what do we do we go to Costco and
buy a bunch of vitamin D because you're
[SPEAKER_08]: not getting it out of your food you got to
get it out of your food which is the same
[SPEAKER_08]: thing with your plant so what happens with
LEDs it's actually harmful to you it's
[SPEAKER_08]: harmful for people people know that
there's studies on this and you're just
[SPEAKER_08]: giving it one sharp same thing with with
high-pressure sodium it'll grow as you
[SPEAKER_08]: well know with a flashlight I mean it's a
beautiful plant but don't give yourself
[SPEAKER_08]: credit so the reason I and people walk in
and they go oh look at all these great
[SPEAKER_08]: light you know they look at it from a
luminous flux what their eyes can see I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: not getting enough coverage really you can
see ultraviolet you can see infrared
[SPEAKER_08]: really that's really great if you know so
so when you look at something and we the
[SPEAKER_08]: way I'll prove this to you and I'll stop
cat is when you look at what's the bird in
[SPEAKER_08]: India with a beautiful plumage a peacock
do you know what color a peacock is
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody know what color is a peacock it's
gray seriously it's gray everything about
[SPEAKER_08]: that plant is gray but the way nature
biomimicry creates edges in that feather
[SPEAKER_08]: reflects refracts the color to your eyes
you think it's blue and green and red and
[SPEAKER_08]: all that but it's not it's not so when you
walk into a grow room and you go oh I got
[SPEAKER_08]: light coverage here's my par meter let me
give it 23% of it now you wonder why and
[SPEAKER_08]: then you create these hybrids that are
poison so either you're doing poison weed
[SPEAKER_08]: seriously or you're doing cannabis right
that's all you're doing if you're doing
[SPEAKER_08]: outdoors and you're and you're doing
regenerative Lee and you're doing living
[SPEAKER_08]: soil that's medicine anything above and
beyond that with HPS or anything is poison
[SPEAKER_07]: sorry I just want to add one thing so in
teaming with microbes I always say you
[SPEAKER_07]: know 50 to 60 percent of the
photosynthetic energy is used by the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: to produce the extra dates that drip out
into the soil if you're using an LED light
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're using an HPS light you are not
allowing the plant to efficiently and
[SPEAKER_07]: easily get that photosynthetic energy that
it's using to make those extra dates
[SPEAKER_07]: that's the first thing the second thing is
in teaming with nutrients I point out that
[SPEAKER_07]: there are 17 nutrients that make
everything that's in that plant we can put
[SPEAKER_07]: down all the garbage we want that's made
by you know general hydroponic etc etc
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't make a damn bit of difference it's
those 17 nutrients that you got to have so
[SPEAKER_07]: that the plant can make what it needs to
make all right if you don't have and the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant makes everything using the
photosynthetic energy and some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: energy that's made by the mitochondria if
you don't have an efficient source of
[SPEAKER_07]: energy coming in in terms of light the
plant has to struggle to do it and that's
[SPEAKER_07]: why you end up with poison or cannabis
that's not really the kind of cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: that we want so so we know this in the in
the agricultural field because we know
[SPEAKER_07]: that from 1948 or 45 after World War two
on our nutritional value in a bowl of
[SPEAKER_07]: salad has gone down to the point where
it's worthless now because of the inputs
[SPEAKER_07]: that we put into the soil because a lot of
this stuff is grown indoors a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff is grown hydroponically we know it
we know it from the food side of it the
[SPEAKER_07]: same thing applies to the cannabis side of
it we know it and and yet we still go out
[SPEAKER_07]: and buy an LED light because it's cheapest
we can afford it it's efficient you know
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than trying to grow the plant
outside first of all where you don't have
[SPEAKER_07]: to put in all these inputs and second of
all trying to figure out a way to grow it
[SPEAKER_07]: inside as close to possible as it is
outside that's what we're supposed to be
[SPEAKER_07]: doing not the cheapest way but the natural
way and we tend in this industry to go the
[SPEAKER_07]: cheapest way the most efficient way as
opposed to the natural way which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: what I think we ought to be doing so if
you could maybe explain the importance of
[SPEAKER_04]: like ancestral growing dry farming and
boosting community as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: incorporating Jeff's teaming with microbe
series sins light on demand as well as the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics here don't you feel like where we
could possibly be in a golden age of
[SPEAKER_04]: possibilities and new possibilities within
the cannabis genome itself and maybe even
[SPEAKER_04]: going back to where we had access via
trade routes like the Silk Road or
[SPEAKER_04]: seafaring trade routes that maybe those
land race genetics were being bred through
[SPEAKER_04]: different countries that they just were
using acts or they were just using
[SPEAKER_04]: selection through thousands of seeds as
opposed to maybe ten seeds that we're used
[SPEAKER_04]: to now can you maybe touch on that stuff
okay so so it's commonly known that that
[SPEAKER_06]: in in in full variables that there's
approximately a hundred and thirty six
[SPEAKER_06]: original land races from around the world
and within about four hundred years that
[SPEAKER_06]: tripled because of cross pollination due
to you know regions that they were growing
[SPEAKER_06]: in and so on so forth and that's why you
get some of your breakdowns of the
[SPEAKER_06]: different types of Afghani or the
different you know your base sativas and
[SPEAKER_06]: so on so forth one of the one of the pure
strains that I was able to locate was
[SPEAKER_06]: called law Anita Lagrimosa Jane the
tearful maiden I went over to Spain I
[SPEAKER_06]: spent 90 days over there I worked with a
cultivator just outside of Barcelona he
[SPEAKER_06]: actually gave me the entire history of
that strain and it dates back to the
[SPEAKER_06]: plague first first getting to Spain and
none in a cloister had been growing the
[SPEAKER_06]: law Anita they they used it as natural
medicine it was it grew in inside the I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't know what you call it the courtyard
of of that of that convent there and when
[SPEAKER_06]: she saw the signs of the plague in the
fisherman's village she went up there and
[SPEAKER_06]: stripped all the leaves off the plant
boiled them in water and went down and
[SPEAKER_06]: served that tea to everyone okay only
people who died from the plague during
[SPEAKER_06]: that period and of infestation were the
people who did not drink the tea who
[SPEAKER_06]: refused to drink it they thought it was a
devil's you know thing okay so and and the
[SPEAKER_06]: preservation of that was actually carried
on through the religious sect not so much
[SPEAKER_06]: as the common farmer you know having it
available to them and when villagers got
[SPEAKER_06]: sick they would go to see the nuns the
nuns would take care of them but the name
[SPEAKER_06]: of the strain actually came because of the
woman she was beheaded you know by the
[SPEAKER_06]: king of Spain for for healing those people
there was a land deal involved and they
[SPEAKER_06]: needed the villages cleared out so that
they could build a French port and
[SPEAKER_06]: Isabella would have married the king of
Spain at that time and it was at that time
[SPEAKER_06]: that they found out that this woman
altered their plans and there's a famous
[SPEAKER_06]: painting that was done of the woman
hanging upside to her body upside down in
[SPEAKER_06]: the form of a cross and her head in the
spike right next to it but the cloister is
[SPEAKER_06]: in the background of the painting and in
the window you will see the hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: percent sativa leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah it was tripled tripled to quadrupled
so so in from well that would be from
[SPEAKER_06]: today we're talking about 400 years
because you have to remember hemp was in
[SPEAKER_06]: huge production back at the beginning and
establishment of this country so we had
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds coming in from all over all the
European continents you know between Spain
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and Ireland Scotland every place
that they you know even Rome Italy Italy
[SPEAKER_06]: was known for high some of the best
highest grade hemp available for making
[SPEAKER_06]: you know for clothing and for sales so you
think about a lot of the strains that that
[SPEAKER_06]: were crossed into the original land races
were hemp that were crossed into it and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's where you'll find very variations
when you do a hundred seeds you can find a
[SPEAKER_06]: variation of a seed that gives you a
higher CBD value to it so it's important
[SPEAKER_06]: that when you get the plant to this tall
that you take a cut of it grow it out you
[SPEAKER_06]: know do it do a quick flower of it and get
a CBD value on it get your THC values find
[SPEAKER_06]: out what your CBG values are you know with
having the laboratories available to us
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have today we should be able to
break down all of the individual
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids to a point where there's not
an illness on this planet that we can't
[SPEAKER_06]: fix you know I think when the creator
reached his finger down and touched a spot
[SPEAKER_06]: and the first cannabis plant grew he knew
exactly what he was doing okay and up
[SPEAKER_06]: until man got in the way in 1928 man got
in the way okay I don't think our federal
[SPEAKER_06]: government should collect any taxes I
don't think our states should collect any
[SPEAKER_06]: taxes I don't think our police department
should be using any money raised from this
[SPEAKER_06]: okay because they lied to you for 75 years
they lied to you they took this out of a
[SPEAKER_06]: doctor's hands okay so that they could
push a pharmaceutical industry that has
[SPEAKER_06]: done nothing but cause harm and cause
macular degeneration to the human genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: that is today and we need to take it back
[SPEAKER_06]: my Panama red came out like Panama red and
I'm talking 1974 1975 Panama red and if
[SPEAKER_06]: you came out to the farm I would smoke
some with you and you'd be you'd be happy
[SPEAKER_06]: you met Panama red okay it's a this is the
one thing you know the the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between okay when you put a plant outside
for the first time okay generally within
[SPEAKER_06]: seven to nine days it's starts to you know
you're you're starting to get your boost
[SPEAKER_06]: growth and everything but it can take you
up to 30 days to finally get a sex on that
[SPEAKER_06]: plant unless you're using something like
phylos okay but I can't recommend the
[SPEAKER_06]: laboratories for sexing okay there was a
point that I thought I could but I cannot
[SPEAKER_06]: do that I had an 80% you know success you
know rate no is 80% success rate with
[SPEAKER_06]: getting females out of the seeds that we
were you know that we were that we were
[SPEAKER_06]: germinating for the first two years but as
soon as the recreational kicked in and
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody was doing it I think time became
a constraint again it boils down to profit
[SPEAKER_06]: last year's test results were 90%
inaccurate 90% okay now you think about
[SPEAKER_06]: that I grow for 23 patients that we have
cards for everybody else gets their
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine for free all the extra excess
that we grow on our farm I sell plants
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what I do I don't sell buds you
will never see my buds you'll see my
[SPEAKER_06]: strains in the dispensary any of you if
any of you have ever smoked or consumed
[SPEAKER_06]: the strawberry express that was designed
for adult seizures it works I created it
[SPEAKER_06]: it's I worked my ass off in order to do it
and I don't care who takes credit for it
[SPEAKER_06]: but the original name was strawberry to
chew but they wouldn't let me use to chew
[SPEAKER_06]: it was a it's a Mazara Sharif that's the
land race of Saudi Arabia crossed with the
[SPEAKER_06]: time wreck from Southern California that's
a natural grown mountainside plant okay
[SPEAKER_06]: and then infused with Kyle Cushman
strawberry cough okay I went from having
[SPEAKER_06]: 18 seizures a day to maybe two maybe three
and that's it and now after continued use
[SPEAKER_06]: I make an RSO from it I do a quarter gram
of it every morning and I haven't had a
[SPEAKER_06]: seizure you know well I haven't won
periodically you know and it's generally
[SPEAKER_00]: due to stress when I get overexcited but
my question goes back to the theme of
[SPEAKER_00]: today's talk which is the preservation of
land rances there seems to be out of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition into this becoming more of a
medically accepted therapeutic agent to
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a green rush towards crossing
land rances with other strains to then
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve a certain outcome with certain
pathology or and with that said just to
[SPEAKER_00]: use your example sir a little bit earlier
with Greenhouse Medical you see these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies this genetic banks going to
places like Congo and Brazil and Colombia
[SPEAKER_00]: and taking these land rices and then
patenting that knowledge later so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous people that have been growing
this for me for for thousands of years are
[SPEAKER_00]: now having to buy this back from the rich
world so with all the amazing benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: that preserving these land rances bring to
us how can we also ensure that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: think of the war on drugs and the people
disproportionately affected by this this
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition don't suffer because we are so
busy preserving them that we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguishing them by crossing them
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah okay so I do tissue cultures of all
my genetics I have two refrigerators that
[SPEAKER_06]: are completely filled and I will keep them
preserved for as long as possible and I
[SPEAKER_06]: have 132 of the listed 498 you know
strains that are available and we do do
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding and we do that intentionally to
zero in on effectiveness okay prime
[SPEAKER_06]: example for you is I brought back a pure
Afghani when I came home from the Marine
[SPEAKER_06]: Corps we won't have too much of a
conversation about that but it was the
[SPEAKER_06]: best pain reliever down-to-earth pain
reliever that I ever ever grew and the one
[SPEAKER_06]: problem that I was having was okay it's
let's simplify a person who's in pain 24
[SPEAKER_06]: hours a day is predisposed to be an
asshole they're always in pain okay so
[SPEAKER_06]: what if you could take away their pain and
change their attitude because if you can
[SPEAKER_06]: change the attitude then you bring the
socialization back which communication and
[SPEAKER_06]: community helped to rebuild and regenerate
and rehabilitate the individual not that
[SPEAKER_06]: you have to hold that person up or hold
their hand okay it's just through common
[SPEAKER_06]: communication so we took a pre-79 euphoria
which was known for taking a woman who can
[SPEAKER_06]: go from zero to bitch in three seconds and
turning that switch off so that she
[SPEAKER_06]: becomes mom again you know or that that
person who is suffering from you know PTSD
[SPEAKER_06]: type issues that snap to judgment or snap
to reaction to what you see you know
[SPEAKER_06]: happening around you so the idea of it was
was take away the pain and change the
[SPEAKER_06]: attitude well we achieved that goal in
creating the Ugani and that was crossing
[SPEAKER_06]: those two strains both of which are land
race strains and then leaving it alone we
[SPEAKER_06]: left it alone after that but what we found
was that it actually worked for sight
[SPEAKER_06]: sound odor over alertness over awareness
and paranoia in a veteran giving the
[SPEAKER_06]: individual back but getting rid of the
symptoms of all of the PTSD so it's
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a certain point where you should
cross you know and try and find an
[SPEAKER_06]: effective change but there's also a
certain point that you should allow it to
[SPEAKER_06]: go it's things should not after things
something's been crossed you know you
[SPEAKER_06]: cross it back to ensure that you have a
stabilized phenol out of it and then at
[SPEAKER_06]: that point there do testing you know so
when you find something that works test it
[SPEAKER_06]: on other people that have the same type of
issues and see what the reactions are as
[SPEAKER_06]: growers what you should be doing when you
take a strain into a dispensary take a
[SPEAKER_06]: little make a little cards okay so that
when a patient goes in and gets your
[SPEAKER_06]: product and takes it home that there's 10
questions on there and you tell them
[SPEAKER_06]: listen if you answer all these honestly
and you bring this back in or mail this
[SPEAKER_06]: out to us okay the next time you go in
you're going to get 10% off or 20% off of
[SPEAKER_06]: your product but over a 30-day period of
them testing your medicine you can
[SPEAKER_06]: actually pinpoint what works and what
doesn't work but what you're going to find
[SPEAKER_06]: is that by going back to the original land
race strains you can actually target
[SPEAKER_08]: better so the other part of that to answer
your question the land races have a whole
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of history and have been used by
Wiseman and medicine man from my part of
[SPEAKER_08]: the country of the world to China so to go
back to that gives you a reference and
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of like the Sun on demand takes you
back to the Sun which is your reference
[SPEAKER_08]: and if you can get the terroir there's
your reference and if you come with the
[SPEAKER_08]: genetics there's your reference you're
somewhere there the hybrids that have come
[SPEAKER_08]: about is because it's called resistance
farming right because you're resisting
[SPEAKER_08]: nature as you go when you go indoors
you're resisting nature so you have to do
[SPEAKER_08]: something else so now you've got to take
an Afghan and you've got a 28-day cycle I
[SPEAKER_08]: need to make money so you know what limit
how do you think oh gee Kush came along
[SPEAKER_08]: right because somebody wanted to make
money they wanted a short cycle and they
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to get a high so it's not all about
THC it's not about THC it's about full
[SPEAKER_08]: plant extract it's about the ensemble
effect because you know what that plant
[SPEAKER_08]: has figured it out already you trying to
screw up in there you trying to go in
[SPEAKER_08]: there and try to do extractive and all
that trying to be a farmer pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_08]: company again is totally bullshit excuse
my French but it totally bullshit because
[SPEAKER_08]: you're poisoning the people you're cutting
your own business and you're shortchanging
[SPEAKER_08]: you're sure damn we can't look in the
mirror now so let's go back to that so
[SPEAKER_08]: what hopefully we're trying to do here is
to talk about how do you create your own
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine for your patients how do you
differentiate yourself in the marketplace
[SPEAKER_08]: as an old farmer and Kat just give me a
few seconds Laurent right here in front of
[SPEAKER_08]: us is one of the inventors of the light
he's the first visit with us he's from
[SPEAKER_08]: Switzerland and thanks to sunshine we were
invited to meet the farmers in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_08]: and the first thing he said after the
night was Sundarajan we make lights I said
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah these are all outdoor farmers yeah
why are we here like they you know and I
[SPEAKER_08]: said well yeah we want outdoor farming he
wants outdoor farming he's got a young
[SPEAKER_08]: daughter that he doesn't want that kind of
food being grown because we're doing food
[SPEAKER_08]: with it too so we could have sold out we
could have gone in and had say Gavita hey
[SPEAKER_08]: guys want to get a license we got to make
a significant amount of money but we're
[SPEAKER_08]: down here talking to people who care who
want to care about their patients who want
[SPEAKER_08]: to create medicine who want to do food
growth so empower yourself instead of
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to be like everybody else in the
grow find medicine that you want to grow
[SPEAKER_08]: that you have in your heart that you would
like to solve a lot of the growers that we
[SPEAKER_08]: talked to had personal experience Harry
Rose would treat well although things went
[SPEAKER_08]: right for him in his business model he's
back again as rosette down in California
[SPEAKER_08]: he was saved by his own balance tincture
and that's why he's here so every I'm sure
[SPEAKER_08]: most of you have stories of people you've
helped or you helped yourself get that
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine the one that you feel the most
passionate about and make it as best as
[SPEAKER_08]: you can you're gonna blow away everybody
people can find their way to you if you do
[SPEAKER_08]: that in a very natural way even if it's
indoors sorry yeah I just wanted to answer
[SPEAKER_01]: your your question and it's true
intellectual property from indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: people around the world is yeah it's being
taken and being used commercially and so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's this has been happening across the
Amazon basin where pharmaceuticals coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in and finding this these plant medicines
and it's we're not just facing it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: just about preserving small farms here in
Oregon or in California but it's across
[SPEAKER_01]: the world women have been cultivating this
medicine they have been getting it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been allowing their children to to go to
school and that still we need to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: those small farmers around the world alive
and and preserve that and with that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really know exactly what the answer
is around around genetics and around I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it's I don't want to see a surf
system where it's like okay we come and
[SPEAKER_01]: take your genetics then we sell it back to
you and then you grow for us oh now you
[SPEAKER_01]: can make a living because you grow for us
and that model cannot it may not be the
[SPEAKER_01]: the right one part of these genetics
they're entering commercialism for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time these land races these were
growing not intended for money not
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever it was used for spiritual
healing it was used for healing people and
[SPEAKER_01]: this clash with commercialism is it's it's
it's very real and it's something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should all be thinking about
[SPEAKER_07]: well I mean it's pretty obvious that that
I that we all agree we want to have great
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics we want to have great light you
know we want to have natural soils I mean
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just makes sense to do it that way
and and I I just I'm always so impressed
[SPEAKER_07]: when I come to a talk like this and I
listen to people and you know I have my
[SPEAKER_07]: stupid ideas and then I hear somebody you
know we find it make it even better and
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know this is this is what's so
cool about this industry that I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: think we'll ever see the big guys doing we
get together we share information you know
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like the I always like to say we're
a bunch of we're just one big cell you
[SPEAKER_07]: know and we're all enzymes in here and
we're all helping build the cell better
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's what we do and and and it
doesn't matter whether you make money or
[SPEAKER_07]: not what matters is that you grow the best
plant possible because that's what it's
[SPEAKER_07]: all about we're supposed to be growing the
best plants possible so let's go forth and
[SPEAKER_01]: do it I just I just wanted to add to this
conflict between between commercialism and
[SPEAKER_01]: being farmers and that is is that this
this culture of gifting and sharing is
[SPEAKER_01]: with the home grower and we should be
encouraging and be helping everyone home
[SPEAKER_07]: grow okay so I'm going to add to that so I
have a new book coming out on auto
[SPEAKER_07]: flowering cannabis because I think that
now that we've got the stigma going away
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's becoming legal in all the states
and in Canada and Bolivia and every place
[SPEAKER_07]: else it's the next tomato this is the
plant that my mother will grow when snap
[SPEAKER_07]: peas came out what I say is is once or
twice in a lifetime a new plant is
[SPEAKER_07]: developed for the home gardener snap peas
oh my god now there's 15 different kinds
[SPEAKER_07]: of snap and I might add I think it started
right here in Oregon auto flowering
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis gives you the ability to grow
from from seed to flower harvested seven
[SPEAKER_07]: to nine weeks that's the stuff and you if
you fertilize it too much you screw up the
[SPEAKER_07]: soil food web too much they don't grow
well holy crow it's a plant that needs to
[SPEAKER_07]: be ignored in a sense you give it natural
conditions it does phenomenal they've
[SPEAKER_07]: improved the genetics now that we've got
lights and things that we can even even
[SPEAKER_07]: make them even better this is the plant
that my mother my sisters I don't have a
[SPEAKER_07]: sister will grow at home because it's just
like a tomato plant so it's coming folks
[SPEAKER_07]: and the home gardener we need to support
so speaking of that we do have a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: books and a hat signed by Jeff so if
you're a huge fan come up claim it we will
[SPEAKER_02]: we will give that to you and then I think
we're going to turn on the light for
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone just interested in seeing the Sun
inside I've seen it a thousand times and I
[SPEAKER_02]: still am amazed every time it turns on so
if you have five minutes stick around for
[SPEAKER_02]: that David that's your love
