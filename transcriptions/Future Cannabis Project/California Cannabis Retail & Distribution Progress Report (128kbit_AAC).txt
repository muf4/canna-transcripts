[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Kat Packer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Executive Director of the
Department of Cannabis Regulation for the
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a joy to be here with you this
morning to talk about the state of retail
[SPEAKER_03]: and distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to let folks know that Joe Devlin
and I, Joe's sitting right here to my
[SPEAKER_03]: left, he and I just got back from Denver
last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were part of a deli delegation that
went to go check to see what was going on
[SPEAKER_03]: in the city of Denver in the state of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I most appreciated
about that trip is that although Denver
[SPEAKER_03]: and the state of Colorado have been doing
this, this cannabis legalization and
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation for six years or so,
I looked to Joe and I said, we're not that
[SPEAKER_03]: far off.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are issues that we are tackling that
the city of Denver and the state of
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado have not even begun to scratch
the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited to be able to share and
hear from panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually appreciate being in this
position and being able to moderate,
[SPEAKER_03]: so thank you, Susan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm normally the one who gets asked 300
questions a day, so this will be nice for
[SPEAKER_03]: me to get a chance to be the one asking
the questions, but I have an excellent
[SPEAKER_03]: group of panelists here today who are
going to share and share information about
[SPEAKER_03]: their experiences and what the last nine
months has really meant for the state of
[SPEAKER_03]: California in terms of retail or
distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to ask my fellow panelists to
take about one to two minutes to introduce
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself, let folks know who are here,
who you are and what you do as it relates
[SPEAKER_03]: to retail or distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with you, Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Joe Devlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the chief of cannabis policy and
enforcement for the city of Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_04]: and what that means is in a nutshell,
I've been responsible for putting forward
[SPEAKER_04]: all the policy recommendations for the
council as it relates to the adoption of
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacramento's regulatory infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also do all the processing and
permitting for the local cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, we also do the
enforcement side of things as well of
[SPEAKER_04]: legal cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in my job for about 18 years and
18 months now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to that, I worked for the city
council and helped create the office and
[SPEAKER_04]: create the position, and then I liked the
job so much that I applied for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Eric Spitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the founder and CEO of C4 Distro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started this company in 2016 with the
idea of helping the cannabis industry move
[SPEAKER_01]: from backpack to briefcase, what we like
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 35 people who focus their
attention servicing producers and
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cover 260 plus stores, all the legal
stores in Southern California with a field
[SPEAKER_01]: staff of about 20 people, a back office
infrastructure as well as a warehouse
[SPEAKER_01]: staff and a set of drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are trying to do is help the
industry really get to a place where other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries are which is a fluid and
working logistics path and supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have experience in the beer industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I operated a media company and have been
starting companies for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really for me a coming home to an
industry that is in a wonderful spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to talking to the panel and
Kat and really helping all of you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what we're facing so that we
can share and grow together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Eric.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Jared Kylo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the president of the United Cannabis
Business Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: We originated here in Los Angeles working
with pre-ICO property compliant retailers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We now represent about half of the
retailers here in Los Angeles and about
[SPEAKER_05]: 25% of the retailers throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've kind of moved into a state
legislative committee as an organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our organization represents retail almost
exclusively, but we also have five
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: We felt like understanding the supply
chain was going to be really important in
[SPEAKER_05]: moving through regulations and having good
relationships with the people who are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be delivering products to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I think most of the people in my
organization as retailers have had a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of experience with cultivators throughout
the years because they've been operating
[SPEAKER_05]: in Los Angeles for up to a decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also own the higher path in Sherman Oaks
which is just in the valley here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been nice because of my experience in
Northern California running retail up
[SPEAKER_05]: there and also kind of being part of the
medical marijuana task force up in San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nice to come to Los Angeles and
really try to find the organization that
[SPEAKER_05]: really seemed like it was necessary to
move what was kind of a chaotic,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, regulations in LA to something a
lot more clear and concise and also with
[SPEAKER_05]: the help and leadership of Kat,
it's been a nice experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you look at Los Angeles having
more retail licenses than any other
[SPEAKER_05]: municipality, so it's a heavy lift to be
here in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also a heavy lift because we have a
lot of illegal operators or at least
[SPEAKER_05]: people who are unregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trying to find that balance has been a
Herculean task for everyone in Los
[SPEAKER_05]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate everyone coming out today
to try to listen to some of the hardships
[SPEAKER_05]: we have as retailers and distributors,
but also some of the conclusions and
[SPEAKER_05]: solutions we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think some of it's going to take a
cohesive group to kind of fight for the
[SPEAKER_05]: same things and for us to come up with
really good solutions that kind of help
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am pleased to be here today.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Pamela Epstein with my fellow
panelists, and I am the owner and founder
[SPEAKER_08]: of GreenWise Company.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a consulting company and a law
firm, so they work together to help
[SPEAKER_08]: operators along the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, we work with dispensaries
and distributors about how you navigate
[SPEAKER_08]: this complex and ever-changing regulatory
framework that we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of that comes to the bedrock
foundations of good contract drafting,
[SPEAKER_08]: agreements, how people interface together,
because as we'll talk about, the best time
[SPEAKER_08]: to go through the difficult terms and to
plan for what may happen is when everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: gets along and has the same end game,
which is to be profitable and successful
[SPEAKER_08]: in this very complicated market.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I enjoy being able to work with
operators through the process we take them
[SPEAKER_08]: through the local licensure all the way to
state licensing, compliance, moving
[SPEAKER_08]: forward into compliance, auditing
businesses, so that they're able to
[SPEAKER_08]: understand and grapple with what the
regulators want to see from them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be an exciting conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to have both people from the
jurisdictions here as well as operators,
[SPEAKER_08]: because that gives you a dynamic flow of
what everybody needs to be dealing with
[SPEAKER_08]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name's Adam Hijazi.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thanks Susan and the State
of the Cannabis for putting this awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: event together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm on the board of directors for the
Long Beach Collective Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long Beach Collective Association consists
of all of the legal operators in the city
[SPEAKER_02]: of Long Beach, which is retailers,
distributors, cultivators, manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been around since 2010, so at the
time we were advocating for medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the city first bought its ordinance,
it was very difficult for us to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been through a very tough time to
find regulation, working from the
[SPEAKER_02]: community up to find consensus with city
and different departments throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: city and community leaders to see what's
the best way to bring regulation in the
[SPEAKER_02]: city of Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently we have about 150 different
applicants in the city and our membership
[SPEAKER_02]: is growing and the issues that we face
here in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also the owner and managing partner at
Long Beach Green Room and the station.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first legal cannabis facility,
again in 2017, has been reopened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thrilled to be here with the
panelists and look forward to the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you can see, we have a great variety
of stakeholders who are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to ask the stakeholders here
today is to feel free to be completely
[SPEAKER_03]: transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, besides from moderating this
panel, want to use this as an opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: to really learn from experiences and I do
think that it's great that we have folks
[SPEAKER_03]: that are operating in different
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I want to start off by asking
for Joe, Jared, what does retail operation
[SPEAKER_03]: look like in the city of Los Angeles?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does access look like in the city of
Los Angeles or in the city of Sacramento?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does the retail space look like just
generally?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for asking, Kat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the thing is now is there's been a
lot of extinction events that have been
[SPEAKER_05]: happening with regulations and it's been
pushing a lot of everyone in the supply
[SPEAKER_05]: chain to kind of the brink of their own
pocketbooks or venture capital and just
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of the whiplash we have from
regulations being swung from a completely
[SPEAKER_05]: unregulated industry to the most regulated
product ever in California history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to have us do that in a small amount
of time, has been difficult and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see that there's kind of been an
emboldening of the black market because
[SPEAKER_05]: the gap between prices has been so vastly
expanded now that you're looking at 50 to
[SPEAKER_05]: 60% difference in cost and there is that
kind of benchmark where people are willing
[SPEAKER_05]: to pay a little bit more for a regulated
tax product but I think we've gone way
[SPEAKER_05]: beyond that at this point and we're
pushing people back to the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not just pushing consumers it's
not enticing people who are in the black
[SPEAKER_05]: market looking for a space in the
regulated market to allow them to say
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a comfortable place to go if you
really take the risk and the money and the
[SPEAKER_05]: effort to make sure you get to regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that gap has been widening so much
now that every single tax we have at the
[SPEAKER_05]: state and local levels, I mean the city of
Los Angeles has a 10% gross receipt tax on
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well now 80% of my business is
recreational use.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means there's a 10% tax on 80% of my
users there and it's mostly just because
[SPEAKER_05]: most people are letting their prescription
kind of just fall by the wayside because
[SPEAKER_05]: there's not a lot of incentives.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask everyone at this level of
Cat and Joe to really look at how are we
[SPEAKER_05]: going to entice people back to the medical
model?
[SPEAKER_05]: When is that conversation between a
patient and a doctor really going to
[SPEAKER_05]: happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this may be a recreational use but
there are a lot of medicinal uses that you
[SPEAKER_05]: use kind of recreationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two beers before we go somewhere
because we want to go out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well a joint is kind of the same way that
we look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a way to relax and it is something
medicinal to take away stress and if we
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have that conversation with doctors
and we pull further and further away from
[SPEAKER_05]: the medical model, I think we really are
going to get distant away from what our
[SPEAKER_05]: real needs are which is we have a product
that can kind of balance between medical
[SPEAKER_05]: and recreational pretty easily but the
balance is swung and so I think we really
[SPEAKER_05]: need to kind of entice people back into
that medical model and I think lowering
[SPEAKER_05]: taxes to medical users and trying to draw
more of those prescriptions back because I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean as a business I'm seeing that there's
a thousand other illegal dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_05]: delivery companies in LA that have this
firm advantage over me as an independent
[SPEAKER_05]: business and so until we lower taxes to an
equitable way to kind of compete with the
[SPEAKER_05]: black market, I think the pendulum has
swung too far in the direction of
[SPEAKER_05]: over-taxation and we're going to have to
look at this taxation kind of rolling out
[SPEAKER_05]: over three to five years because I don't
know a lot of people who have been in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry this long who are feeling like
wow this is great, this is the most
[SPEAKER_05]: successful I've ever been.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to feel that way and I want to
tell people in the black market that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the way that I feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the most successful I've ever been
but it's not and I think we need to really
[SPEAKER_05]: look at each other and go how do we lower
these costs of becoming compliant and how
[SPEAKER_05]: do we lower the barriers to entry back
into this industry because we've got
[SPEAKER_05]: 50,000 growers and users and people who
have created a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: infrastructure already and we're not
utilizing the infrastructure that's
[SPEAKER_05]: already been built in this economy of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to use it to its full capacity
otherwise we're destroying lives,
[SPEAKER_05]: families and infrastructure that could
easily make tax dollars for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's where I am as a retailer
and as I look at my group of retailers and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not going well look at all the
greatness that we have here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're mostly looking like who's illegal
and I hate to feel that way because if
[SPEAKER_05]: you've been in this industry long enough
you know that you've teetered on that edge
[SPEAKER_05]: of legal and illegal the whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the system is kind of set up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not drawing people over that
fence to say come into the regulated
[SPEAKER_05]: light, let all the tax dollars go back to
the municipalities who put a lot of time
[SPEAKER_05]: and effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean we've been working with LA for a
decade now trying to make sure that we got
[SPEAKER_05]: a license and we worked through limited
immunity forever and so to have a license
[SPEAKER_05]: now in LA and to not be on a fair and
level playing field with other businesses
[SPEAKER_05]: is a really difficult place for a lot of
retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you respond Joe I just want to make
a note you're going to hear me say
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I said yesterday while we
were in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make a point and Jared I hear
what you're saying we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that folks don't have to compete with the
illicit market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a note about terminology here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as we've continued to move forward
and change our terminology to say cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of marijuana it's I feel as though
it is important for me to articulate that
[SPEAKER_03]: we are at a moment in this industry where
it's no longer appropriate to use the term
[SPEAKER_03]: black market to mean criminal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be my ask to the panelists as
we move forward when we mean when we say
[SPEAKER_03]: black market we mean criminal market we
mean illicit market we mean unregulated
[SPEAKER_03]: market we should use those terms instead
of using black to mean criminal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll make that ask of my panelists I'll
make this ask of the room and we'll catch
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves using it we'll have to work
through this we'll find other words that
[SPEAKER_03]: are no longer appropriate we'll work
through that process I should have said it
[SPEAKER_03]: first but thank you Joe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taxation is a huge issue and in fact I got
maybe into a little bit of trouble saying
[SPEAKER_04]: as much to someone that maybe didn't want
to hear it that works for a different
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory agency but tax we do need to
have a robust conversation around taxation
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think for me one of the things right
now I'm trying to what I'd like to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand actually just had a
conversation with the market research
[SPEAKER_04]: companies is how can we understand who
that consumer is and where is that tipping
[SPEAKER_04]: point what is the price elasticity of
cannabis but before they go you know what
[SPEAKER_04]: you know to the heck with it I'm just
gonna go call my my buddy who I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: buying cannabis for for the last 20 years
and I still can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to understand really that
consumer and kind of what is the tipping
[SPEAKER_04]: point and maybe have getting some data
around that I think could help foster that
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation and drive that conversation
in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The retail kind of situation in Sacramento
is we've had 30 dispensaries since 2012 we
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially have had a moratorium on that
since that time we kind of backed into our
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries they started popping up all
over town and council said don't move and
[SPEAKER_04]: then through federal actions and some
attrition we ended up with 30 and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: stayed at 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think our the more dynamic part of our
retail is around delivery at the moment
[SPEAKER_04]: and one of the challenges that we're
facing with delivery is that while we've
[SPEAKER_04]: had delivery and it's existed in in our
community for a number of years it hasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: existed in a form that looked like a
business right there wasn't a brick and
[SPEAKER_04]: mortar and so when when we created a
registry to try and bring these existing
[SPEAKER_04]: operators into the legal framework they
registered with addresses that they
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't operating out of that maybe they
couldn't have that they'll ever be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: really functionally operate out of and so
that has presented the challenge and we
[SPEAKER_04]: are muddling through it we have 65 70
applications for non-storefront delivery
[SPEAKER_04]: in Sacramento and we're gonna continue to
kind of muddle through it until we you
[SPEAKER_04]: know figure it out and my hope is that
enough folks survive that transition and
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't you know become extinct same
question to Adam what's happening in Long
[SPEAKER_02]: Beach in 2010 the city of Long Beach
brought forward an ordinance 5.87 which
[SPEAKER_02]: originally legalized for the first time
retailers and cultivators innovation one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the first cities to do so recently then
there was a gap from 2012 to 2017 about
[SPEAKER_02]: five years of no cannabis whatsoever now
coming back this time around we just
[SPEAKER_02]: literally got recreational cannabis in the
city of Long Beach probably around three
[SPEAKER_02]: four weeks ago yeah so that was a that you
know we were hoping to start at the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of the year but it ended up
being in July so that was a huge issue to
[SPEAKER_02]: not be able to let people back you know we
were denying people entrance into the
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities right now a lot of people are
just going through the process I think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's only about five or there's about
ten or eleven retail facilities that are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually open in the city of Long Beach
currently they're working through the
[SPEAKER_02]: process the fire department the building
department electrical mechanical plumbing
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's been moving along the city of Long
Beach has been pretty friendly and as
[SPEAKER_02]: proactive with helping businesses as much
as possible considering the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're dealing this kind of for the first
time on this level so that's that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome so now facilities are here now in
regards to patients or the consumers kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of echoing a little bit of you know Jared
was saying you know taxation is an issue
[SPEAKER_02]: the illicit markets has always been around
but we need to be able to give a viable
[SPEAKER_02]: option to patients and consumers to be
able to walk through these facilities and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the taxation and where the
taxation kind of started and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: policy that you saw is emotional driven
policies these are policies from
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators legislators when they looked at
cannabis they think oh let's put a syntax
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really a tax it's a high tax if we're
gonna have it in our in our city let's
[SPEAKER_02]: let's tax it at this late let's at least
and thinking that everybody was gonna come
[SPEAKER_02]: in these has these high tax dollars but I
think there was a governor's report that
[SPEAKER_02]: came understated in regards to amount of
tax because there wasn't a true
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of the economics and
mechanics behind the cannabis consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: and the taxation and I definitely welcome
that conversation and there should some
[SPEAKER_02]: should be something that that happens in
regards to that so that's really important
[SPEAKER_02]: in regards to illicit markets they're
gonna be here they're here right now I
[SPEAKER_02]: think you know again Jared was mentioning
is giving the opportunity for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: get involved and a lot of the times when
the city sets cities set up these they're
[SPEAKER_02]: so limited and they're so tough to be able
to get some of these licenses so being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to streamline some of it I mean you
have facility you have cities that they do
[SPEAKER_02]: CUP's business licenses development
agreements three four different kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: licensings to be able to get one license
you know and then when you're done with
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have to deal with the BCC that
food about you have to deal with all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different departments so it's kind of
tastes like a little bit like nuclear
[SPEAKER_02]: waste right now everybody's very you know
eyeballing and regulating it heavily so I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's gonna normalize and it's really
about the perception and that's really the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important thing is the people are
scared who's gonna get in who's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: touching this where the more majority of
people are everyday people or big
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses that are getting involved so
it's a little bit of what's going on and
[SPEAKER_03]: Pamela I want to ask you a question Adam
was just discussing the challenge in
[SPEAKER_03]: bureaucracy of going through the licensing
process with your consulting firm and your
[SPEAKER_03]: law firm how have you been able to help
folks navigate what seemed like very
[SPEAKER_08]: turbulent waters yeah I part of it comes
to know your business and interfacing with
[SPEAKER_08]: the city and helping to educate and being
a source of constant information we're
[SPEAKER_08]: just going to talk about with regard to
taxes is for a greater part these cities
[SPEAKER_08]: are going through drafting tax ordinance
and ballot measures and what that language
[SPEAKER_08]: looks like and it's important to be
engaged in that discussion especially if
[SPEAKER_08]: you're an operator I to be able to say
this tax is going to drive me out of
[SPEAKER_08]: business this half isn't going to have the
ROI to your city that you think it's going
[SPEAKER_08]: to because if I can't operate there's no
influx of capital and then being able to
[SPEAKER_08]: work with them on the language as we're
starting to see moving throughout the
[SPEAKER_08]: state is the flexibility for by resolution
the cities to be able to change the tax
[SPEAKER_08]: levels because to have to go back to the
voters is very difficult so if you have
[SPEAKER_08]: these conversations as you're moving
forward in the process you're able to do
[SPEAKER_08]: that I think the other thing for
applicants to do or operators to do and we
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about this a lot with our clients is
your application is your promise to the
[SPEAKER_08]: city so if you're working with a
consultant or an attorney know what
[SPEAKER_08]: they're putting in your documents make
sure you're sitting and reading for
[SPEAKER_08]: example your community benefits plan if
you're going to make a promise to a city
[SPEAKER_08]: that you're going to give them let's say
20% of your gross sales receipts because
[SPEAKER_08]: you're in a competitive application and
you're like this is what they want to hear
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is going to make me look
successful especially if it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: development agreement and then you come up
short these are one-year permits everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: should remember this is not a vested right
you have to go back work with your city
[SPEAKER_08]: tell them what you've been able to
accomplish and do and if they don't trust
[SPEAKER_08]: you or believe you because you're making
unrealistic promises to them then you
[SPEAKER_08]: won't have a business and somebody else
you're going to be an acquisition target
[SPEAKER_08]: or you're going to be extinct because the
way that I look at it or we look at it is
[SPEAKER_08]: that you've got three real options coming
into 2019 you're an acquisition target
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to survive an acquisition
event or unfortunately you're going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: extinct and the best way that you cannot
go into door number three and survive one
[SPEAKER_08]: in two is to have a good plan and to be
able to navigate that process and to be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to have an open conversation with
those that you are engaged in business
[SPEAKER_08]: with you operate in a city every day and
you're going to come across issues that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to have to go to planning and
building and you're going to have to go to
[SPEAKER_08]: the business license division I talked to
Emily and the city of Long Beach on behalf
[SPEAKER_08]: of my clients that are there on a constant
basis and it's an evolution we need to
[SPEAKER_08]: bring in capital so we have to add an
owner how do you go about doing that when
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of times we've seen throughout these
jurisdictions a prohibition on transfer
[SPEAKER_08]: and that means that you can't change
ownership how do you grow and scale as a
[SPEAKER_08]: business if you are improving a building
and you can't bring in capital the same
[SPEAKER_08]: way other businesses would we've been able
to change the ordinances by having
[SPEAKER_08]: conversations with people like Joe and
Kathy and explaining those very real-world
[SPEAKER_08]: business problems and being able to
manipulate that language when you look at
[SPEAKER_08]: sensitive use receptors as I'm sure all of
the operators are familiar that process is
[SPEAKER_08]: difficult we are just going through that
in Culver City for a client it's a really
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting use you go in you apply and as
I'm sure Jared and Adam can tell you you
[SPEAKER_08]: look for a piece of property you're
looking for a unicorn that it's in the
[SPEAKER_08]: green zone it's zoned correctly it has
enough power it has parking it meets all
[SPEAKER_08]: the requirements you go you apply you get
a business license and then you have to go
[SPEAKER_08]: through a CUP what if a sensitive use
receptor either accidentally or on purpose
[SPEAKER_08]: unfortunately opens up next to you if you
don't set the game board if you don't work
[SPEAKER_08]: with the city and say at the time of the
submission window set the game board set
[SPEAKER_08]: where the green zones are if a use comes
in they understand that the potential for
[SPEAKER_08]: a cannabis business is there because if
you do it at the date of receipt of
[SPEAKER_08]: application and you have a 30 60 90 day
application window all the sudden these
[SPEAKER_08]: operators have invested tens of thousands
of dollars and they're buffered out
[SPEAKER_08]: overnight or if it's that time of issuance
and you're going through a CUP and we saw
[SPEAKER_08]: this in Lemon Grove somebody popped in a
daycare center paid them $10,000 to file
[SPEAKER_08]: the paperwork so that somebody else no
longer could move forward in that process
[SPEAKER_08]: if the regulators don't understand if the
cities don't understand that this is what
[SPEAKER_08]: you're grappling with they don't know how
to respond to that so I think overall the
[SPEAKER_08]: most important is to be informed be
engaged work with a good lawyer work with
[SPEAKER_08]: a good consultant but know what they're
doing and direct them don't let somebody
[SPEAKER_08]: say I think Amanda said it best yesterday
put a windmill on top of your building
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's gonna make you more
attractive or solar and then not be able
[SPEAKER_08]: to do it and it's not feasible that's only
shooting yourself in the foot and and
[SPEAKER_08]: souring a relationship with the city
that's moving into regulation that is
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult Eric we heard Jared mention
these mastic mass extinction moments
[SPEAKER_03]: either on January 1st or July 1st what has
that meant for a distributor what does
[SPEAKER_03]: that meant for distributors across the
state of California so we look at this
[SPEAKER_01]: market as a consumer market so if you
would look at the cannabis industry as a
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer market the way we do we see for
market segments flour concentrates edibles
[SPEAKER_01]: and wellness we what we use wellness as a
catch-all category for the topicals and
[SPEAKER_01]: the tinctures and the stuff that doesn't
fit into the other categories so we know
[SPEAKER_01]: how much of the current volume is going
through each of the categories what's been
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating about these extinction moments
is July 1st caused a complete reset of the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower category a complete reset what do I
mean by that I mean that the stores were
[SPEAKER_01]: empty to the point where if you had a
previous brand in the old regime you still
[SPEAKER_01]: had to start over just like everybody who
is starting over with a new brand in the
[SPEAKER_01]: new regime everybody had to learn how to
package everybody had to learn how to test
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody had to learn how to make sure
that everything was child proofed
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody had to learn how to go into the
store with the right coa's the right proof
[SPEAKER_01]: that this product is correct and we learn
that over the six month period some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: brands learn that some of the brands
didn't learn that and needed to start
[SPEAKER_01]: learning it in the new July 1 post July 1
environment so that's what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's really fascinating because inside
of this new emergent time in the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: space you're gonna start to see some real
innovation and I see that innovation
[SPEAKER_01]: coming over the next 90 to 150 days you're
gonna see brands that you've never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: before that are gonna blow your socks off
from a branding perspective they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: start to look like brands that you
recognize from the alcohol world from the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer package world the boxes are gonna
be pretty there's gonna be a backstory for
[SPEAKER_01]: the brand so you're gonna know where they
came from and who's behind them and what
[SPEAKER_01]: their sourcing is and why they believe
what they believe about you and you
[SPEAKER_01]: joining as a consumer their tribe so
that's coming and it's really exciting so
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to ask you another question Pamela
what has it look like for businesses to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with one another to set up these
agreements to set up contracts to ensure
[SPEAKER_03]: that there are products on the shelves and
I'm sure there was disruption when we went
[SPEAKER_03]: through these various moments January 1
2018 I know in the city of Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a lot of disruption so I want to
hear from Pamela first and then Jared I'd
[SPEAKER_08]: like to hear from you as well we've seen
with our operators that legacy operators
[SPEAKER_08]: and early adopters tend to have the most
difficulty here because they're used to
[SPEAKER_08]: saying this is somebody I trust they're
used to saying you know I didn't put
[SPEAKER_08]: things in right because that was evidence
and that was evidence that I was teetering
[SPEAKER_08]: in this you know almost regulated limited
immunity whatever it is that these times
[SPEAKER_08]: had and so it's really coming around to
this sensibility of what is traditional
[SPEAKER_08]: regular business we have this conversation
a lot what do other heavily regulated
[SPEAKER_08]: industries do we're not reinventing the
wheel in cannabis we are simply adding
[SPEAKER_08]: another widget to a commodities market and
so contracting is the cornerstone and the
[SPEAKER_08]: fundamentals of good business because
there are provisions and there are things
[SPEAKER_08]: that are coming as we march towards ever
closer full legalization at the federal
[SPEAKER_08]: level what does that mean that means you
can get to federal court when we're
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about negligence claims and we're
talking about product liabilities claims
[SPEAKER_08]: that are coming there are things like
trouble damages that happen when you can
[SPEAKER_08]: get into a federal situation so they're
looming they're waiting we've seen prop 65
[SPEAKER_08]: lawsuits that are coming you've got to be
ahead of it you've got to know that when
[SPEAKER_08]: you're a retailer if you're contracting or
you're a manufacturer and you're
[SPEAKER_08]: contracting to get flour how that flour is
getting to you where's the custody in
[SPEAKER_08]: control who is in control of it who is
responsible if there is a rape an act
[SPEAKER_08]: accident hijacking who is responsible for
this product are you covered from an
[SPEAKER_08]: insurance perspective who where does it go
if you're using a transport only licensee
[SPEAKER_08]: they can't hold custody to the product so
on one end of that transaction somebody's
[SPEAKER_08]: covering when somebody else is moving
physically moving the product when you're
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about our QA QC procedures here in
California protect the consumer that's
[SPEAKER_08]: what they're driven to do so the point of
testing is right before it gets B to C
[SPEAKER_08]: that's when the distributors
responsibility that means if you're a man
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're a cultivator and you're selling
product to a manufacturer where that
[SPEAKER_08]: product may get contaminated if it's that
it's clean when it left the cultivators
[SPEAKER_08]: but by the time it gets the manufacturer
and the manufacturer doesn't test it
[SPEAKER_08]: before they manufacture it and all of a
sudden it gets concentrated and at the end
[SPEAKER_08]: of the line it tests dirty whose
responsibility is that that's a contract
[SPEAKER_08]: term that's where you need to be penning
out all of these different levels of how
[SPEAKER_08]: you interface together as a supply chain
making sure that the excitec is collected
[SPEAKER_08]: and paid you are responsible from the
state agencies perspective for everything
[SPEAKER_08]: that you do and everything that it goes
along the pivot points on the supply chain
[SPEAKER_08]: so you're gonna want to know that
everybody else in that line is doing the
[SPEAKER_08]: same thing you are in the best way to
protect yourself and your business is
[SPEAKER_08]: through these agreements and it's a
difficult lift it is not easy it is
[SPEAKER_08]: expensive you're going to start to see the
prices coming down working with a good
[SPEAKER_08]: lawyer you get a what I'd like to say is a
suite of agreements that then you're just
[SPEAKER_08]: tearing off so if you're a vendor ask a
distributor to send you a distribution
[SPEAKER_08]: agreement don't read it read it yourself
have your lawyer read it go through what
[SPEAKER_08]: red lines you want to do and then have a
meaningful conversation we're all figuring
[SPEAKER_08]: it out that's the great part about this
industry is it is community-based we've
[SPEAKER_08]: most of us have been here we're working
through these issues together use it as a
[SPEAKER_08]: collaborative framework but please don't
cut the fat when it comes to your legal
[SPEAKER_08]: representation and putting down on paper
where responsibilities liabilities and
[SPEAKER_08]: warranties go when we're talking about
packaging and labeling and where that
[SPEAKER_08]: little California Universal symbol needs
to go and the primary panel this is my
[SPEAKER_08]: plea there are four things I know branding
we just talked about being very expensive
[SPEAKER_08]: your logo is not one of the four things
that needs to be on the front of your
[SPEAKER_08]: product I am sorry I understand I have
this conversation several times a day it
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't it's the net weight in US and
foreign metrics it is the universal
[SPEAKER_08]: California symbol which should be in scale
size to your logo it should not be the
[SPEAKER_08]: tiniest thing with your big logo and then
you've got to name your product a vape
[SPEAKER_08]: cartridge is not correct it's a cannabis
vape cartridge needs to identify the
[SPEAKER_08]: product name and it needs to be on the
part of your product with the ordinary
[SPEAKER_08]: course of business that a consumer sees
I'm sure that Jared and Adam go through
[SPEAKER_08]: this all the time when you're checking
these products do you take them into your
[SPEAKER_08]: store do you run the risk of the BCC
coming in and somebody saying they're
[SPEAKER_08]: getting easier and easier to identify I
don't know if Jared and Adam want to weigh
[SPEAKER_08]: in but these days I walk into a dispensary
you can zero in on a non-compliant package
[SPEAKER_08]: much more quickly so this isn't the time
to play around it's the time to contract
[SPEAKER_08]: put all the terms in writing make sure you
understand what they all are evidence that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're meeting all of these other
ancillary regulatory protocols and then
[SPEAKER_08]: you can go about the business of being
profitable and being ready to survive into
[SPEAKER_03]: 2019 that was a lot of great advice that
was shared Jared I want to ask you I
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate with Los Angeles stakeholders
on a regular basis and one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: frustrations that I heard very early on
when we started our process from our
[SPEAKER_03]: existing medical marijuana dispensaries
was that they were concerned because of
[SPEAKER_03]: our phase licensing approach that they
weren't going to be able to carry Los
[SPEAKER_03]: Angeles based products on the shelves and
so I know a lot of those relationships
[SPEAKER_03]: have changed over time because folks don't
have licensing yet what has that meant for
[SPEAKER_03]: your retail business and your existing
relationships with other either
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators or manufacturers in the city
of Los Angeles how has that changed over
[SPEAKER_05]: time I think we took a couple of steps
back as being the leader in the world with
[SPEAKER_05]: production in Los Angeles by not allowing
the producers to really continue the
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships of which they had had for
well over a decade and supplying all the
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers of Los Angeles a lot of the
products that they wanted and by cutting
[SPEAKER_05]: off that supply chain you had to now jump
outside of Los Angeles to find
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships and I mean I'm uniquely I
guess benefit from coming from Northern
[SPEAKER_05]: California and having a lot of those
relationships with direct with cultivators
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that where I live it's one degree
of separation from a cultivator in
[SPEAKER_05]: Southern California it's six degrees of
separation and so to find that direct
[SPEAKER_05]: connection with someone you can trust or
someone who has a product that you can
[SPEAKER_05]: tell what the consistency is or know that
there's going to be you know a consistent
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of product so that your customers
can become very aware of what products you
[SPEAKER_05]: have and expect them to be tomorrow that
got cut off and a lot of the people who
[SPEAKER_05]: had spent branding opportunity in LA to
target that market when they didn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: the ability to grow or produce or
manufacture and distribute inside the city
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it I think it took us back a
little bit but in the grand scheme of
[SPEAKER_05]: things you're looking at more retail
licenses than any other municipality so we
[SPEAKER_05]: had to start somewhere it wasn't just this
free-for-all there's already been a
[SPEAKER_05]: free-for-all in Los Angeles for a long
time and so when you have to draw the line
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere and say this is our starting
point and this is our foundation a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people got cut out and I don't know how to
say what we could have done different to
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that more legacy operators were
able to enter into into the industry but
[SPEAKER_05]: it had been illegal to grow off site of a
non-prop D compliant location for five
[SPEAKER_05]: years so it's been known that that has
been an illegal place to be but in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry of allowing the legacy people a
first opportunity to enter into the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated market I think we waited a
little too long in Los Angeles to really
[SPEAKER_05]: allow those legacy people an opportunity
to supply their own community and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: we will build really fast in Los Angeles
and there's going to be some unfortunate
[SPEAKER_05]: legacy people who are not going to make it
we are not a normal business I mean when I
[SPEAKER_05]: look across the street at one of the
largest Ralph's in the country and I know
[SPEAKER_05]: that I pay almost the same kind of
business taxes they do with my five
[SPEAKER_05]: million dollars of revenue and their 200
million dollars of revenue and we have the
[SPEAKER_05]: same business taxes we are not equal
businesses so so we have to look at
[SPEAKER_05]: ourselves and go yes we want to operate
like normal businesses but we're not
[SPEAKER_05]: treated like a normal business there's no
other group that has even above a point
[SPEAKER_05]: zero two seven percent like retail tax is
a business tax inside the city of Los
[SPEAKER_05]: Angeles so to say that I'm paying close to
eight percent on average between my five
[SPEAKER_05]: and ten percent gross receipts tax for a
local tax like we're not a normal business
[SPEAKER_05]: and being taxed at fifty and sixty percent
and then then at the end of the year
[SPEAKER_05]: having my accountant say wow you're 280
taxes well you're gonna another four
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred thousand like whoa I did not
necessarily budget for that and so how do
[SPEAKER_05]: you budget for an unknown of all these
taxes and since we have swung the pendulum
[SPEAKER_05]: so far and are not giving any relief to
businesses just trying to be good
[SPEAKER_05]: operators it's just been a very difficult
time and I think Los Angeles has a good
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to really show the strength
that we have as a community and rebuild
[SPEAKER_05]: together but we're still waiting for fire
to come and do inspections so we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know what the attrition rate of the fire
department is going to be where the
[SPEAKER_05]: building department of planning is going
to be and since a lot of these variables
[SPEAKER_05]: are still up in the air there's a lot of
there's a lot of insecurity because we've
[SPEAKER_05]: invested like my whole life savings is
currently in my business I don't have a
[SPEAKER_05]: savings anymore and because it's all right
here and what used to be a nice return on
[SPEAKER_05]: investment now it's it's a maybe and that
maybe is becoming more and more difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: to say who is willing to take their life
savings put it into this industry again
[SPEAKER_05]: and start from scratch because that's kind
of what we're doing we're starting from
[SPEAKER_05]: the beginning we're well we're well
regulated we're well taxed I just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that those taxes and and
representation really go to how are you
[SPEAKER_05]: effectively helping our businesses make it
in this particular new regulated industry
[SPEAKER_05]: how is the state of California doing
enforcement and really helping us how are
[SPEAKER_05]: they lowering state taxes so that we don't
have to have a huge burden with 280 e on
[SPEAKER_05]: the federal can the state help us out can
there be some places where we we do give
[SPEAKER_05]: to get mean that the state didn't collect
a lot of taxes and I don't think it was
[SPEAKER_05]: because they didn't think there was a lot
of sales the velocity of sales were not
[SPEAKER_05]: there because there wasn't enough
retailers there wasn't enough compliant
[SPEAKER_05]: product because they created a system that
bottleneck and that bottleneck lowered the
[SPEAKER_05]: number of regulated sales those number of
regulated sales reduced our taxes and now
[SPEAKER_05]: it looks like well the industry is not
moving as fast as it could we're not
[SPEAKER_05]: utilizing all the infrastructure that has
been created over the last 25 years plus
[SPEAKER_05]: in California to the biggest benefit for
the most taxes in return we've gone too
[SPEAKER_05]: far to regulate and we're missing out on a
lot of those legacy people who need more
[SPEAKER_05]: than just six months to a year to
transition I look at some of the power
[SPEAKER_05]: plant companies and they're given 25 years
to adapt their coal burning power plant to
[SPEAKER_05]: a natural gas one 25 years I'm given a
year 18 months six months to adapt and
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes it's two weeks to adapt to a
brand new regulation that just got dropped
[SPEAKER_05]: yesterday that is not the kind of
transitional time this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: infrastructure needs to really be
efficient so we're here with you know many
[SPEAKER_03]: of the folks in this room or either
cannabis advocates cannabis policy
[SPEAKER_03]: advocates cannabis businesses and this
conversation involves many different
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders to include all of those folks
community members law enforcement health
[SPEAKER_03]: officials and you know I think it's going
to take and we've seen that it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: take a collaborative effort for us to move
this process forward as a regulator we
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with the other side of the coin of
all of those same challenges and so I want
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear from Joe what have been some of
the biggest challenges in trying to either
[SPEAKER_03]: manage the retail and distribution space
what have been the concerns that you hear
[SPEAKER_03]: from community members or elected
officials about retail operations because
[SPEAKER_03]: as a regulator we kind of sit in the
middle of all of these different
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders and translate and share
information and try and move the needle
[SPEAKER_03]: forward so what has that process been for
you what have been some of your biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: challenges all of them I find myself kind
of in the uniquely I think in the middle
[SPEAKER_04]: of the public the elected officials and
the in the in the industry and and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that the 360 view on all on
all of this I I do think taxation is too
[SPEAKER_04]: high I mean fundamentally what we're
trying to do is apply economics to the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation of this substance and you know
economic principles still apply no matter
[SPEAKER_04]: how much you want to ignore them so we do
need to be sensitive to that I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: really is really the collective the
totality of it right from for the elective
[SPEAKER_04]: from from the electives perspective I
think they look at this and you're like
[SPEAKER_04]: okay public voted for this but I know that
they're not really a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_04]: supportive of it because when I go out and
have a community meeting everyone's upset
[SPEAKER_04]: that there's a dispensary being planned
near my house or someone wants to open up
[SPEAKER_04]: a cultivation facility you know three
miles from my house I'm pretty sure it's
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna ruin my neighborhood and ruin my
property values and for the the internal
[SPEAKER_04]: organizations of the city we also face our
own challenges we as a city began taking
[SPEAKER_04]: applications for cultivation in the month
of April a year ago we didn't have you're
[SPEAKER_04]: required to get a conditional use permit
in the city of Sacramento we didn't have a
[SPEAKER_04]: single hearing I think until July and
wasn't because we just sat around going
[SPEAKER_04]: well we're just gonna put that on the
bottom of the stack it took three months
[SPEAKER_04]: for planning stuff to figure out what they
were evaluating right I mean this is all
[SPEAKER_04]: still so new for everyone and I think that
that is that the I think the biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge is that it's also new for
everyone it's the regulations are new for
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry becoming like I don't mean
this like in a hopefully it's not taken as
[SPEAKER_04]: an offense but becoming like a business
like I know a lot of legacy actors and yes
[SPEAKER_04]: they were a business but they weren't
really a business if you're in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry you're in the compliance
industry it's really what you what you are
[SPEAKER_04]: in now but it's also new I think for
everyone it's just it's just a lot I think
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone kind of feels like they're
drinking out of the fire hose and I get to
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of see it I see you see it from every
perspective yeah I just want to echo Joe
[SPEAKER_03]: sentiment you know part of the challenge
in this city of Los Angeles is that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know folks want access to licensure but in
order for folks to even have access to
[SPEAKER_03]: licensure there needs to be a licensing
program and licensing programs don't pop
[SPEAKER_03]: out of thin air they need to be created
and so for a city of 4 million people with
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 different elected officials and 96
neighborhood councils there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different opinions to consider and I you
know a lot a lot of the folks who are in
[SPEAKER_03]: this room are on one side of the spectrum
most folks kind of fall in the middle of
[SPEAKER_03]: the bell curve and then you have you know
folks on the other side that are
[SPEAKER_03]: completely opposed but I do think that it
has been difficult for elected officials
[SPEAKER_03]: and public administrators to deal with
this issue cannabis is sexy for the folks
[SPEAKER_03]: in this room but as an elected official
cannabis is not that sexy and you know no
[SPEAKER_03]: one wants to hang their hat on something
that's not guaranteed and the success of
[SPEAKER_03]: this industry and the impacts of this
industry are well known when's the last
[SPEAKER_03]: time we legalized cannabis you know this
is all new and so I appreciate folks like
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe like other elected officials who have
taken leadership on these issues because
[SPEAKER_03]: it can be a real struggle and I think it's
going to be important for the industry to
[SPEAKER_03]: actively participate and identify those
champions at local federal and state
[SPEAKER_03]: levels because you know those are the
folks who are going to be able to move the
[SPEAKER_03]: needle forward while everyone else has
their either their heads in the sand or
[SPEAKER_03]: they're sitting on their hands Pamela
looks like you want to comment Chris can't
[SPEAKER_08]: you made a great point and I think this is
really important I served previously as a
[SPEAKER_08]: special city attorney for the city of
Hollister drafting their regulatory
[SPEAKER_08]: program and their ordinance with them so I
have a unique lens of looking at it from
[SPEAKER_08]: the the city's perspective and from the
operators be involved like cat thing these
[SPEAKER_08]: programs don't happen overnight most of
these staff at cities never thought
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis was something that was going to
be part of their everyday rhetoric that
[SPEAKER_08]: they would have to understand let alone
draft an ordinance so be that active
[SPEAKER_08]: participant if you want to operate in that
city go in and meet with city staff go in
[SPEAKER_08]: and meet with the city council members
offer them a suite of options sometimes
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll put together a package of the
ordinances and the different languages
[SPEAKER_08]: that we thought for our operators work the
best and then proposed draft ordinance
[SPEAKER_08]: language I have drafted ordinances for
several cities across the state on behalf
[SPEAKER_08]: of clients that gave a cheesecake
cheesecake style menu of operations is
[SPEAKER_08]: what we like to call it we did a whole hog
ordinance and we really focused in on what
[SPEAKER_08]: was important for the operators we
represented and provided it as a baseline
[SPEAKER_08]: tool for discussion for that city or that
county to use it is well received they
[SPEAKER_08]: want to understand if the city's dipping
their toe into regulation and cat and Joe
[SPEAKER_08]: are great it's a good opportunity to
provide a meaningful information so they
[SPEAKER_08]: understand your process they understand
what you're gonna go through as a business
[SPEAKER_08]: they understand how your business
functions since it is different and new
[SPEAKER_08]: don't miss that opportunity it's critical
if you come to them at the point of the
[SPEAKER_08]: application and you've never showed up at
a meeting and you've never been engaged
[SPEAKER_08]: you're just a name on a piece of paper now
their converse is that is don't go in and
[SPEAKER_08]: think because you're providing these
things you are guaranteed a license you
[SPEAKER_08]: are not don't go in and because the mayor
is your friend thinking you've got nothing
[SPEAKER_08]: to worry about this is you in the bag
that's not it this is a purely providing
[SPEAKER_08]: information and shepherding the process
and being a source of hey you know what
[SPEAKER_08]: these regulations came out really what's
going on there and updating them as that
[SPEAKER_04]: process unfolds I think other cities
coming on line is gonna take some time
[SPEAKER_04]: there's still political risk to this you
look at how prop 64 fared in a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: these counties and a number of these
cities and and it wasn't 6040 it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit closer to 5050 and there's not
a lot of electeds that are willing to go
[SPEAKER_04]: out there and say hey you know what 5050
that's good enough I'm gonna lead the
[SPEAKER_04]: charge on this one and risk my political
career on it so I think it's gonna take a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of time but what is gonna delay
that is gonna be poor experiences by
[SPEAKER_04]: cities like Sacramento and Los Angeles if
you know if and when things go wrong you
[SPEAKER_04]: know we've had a very positive experience
so far and and I don't expect any but you
[SPEAKER_04]: know bad operators or poor operators or
people over promising in this space and
[SPEAKER_04]: under delivering just as a as a whole I
think potentially slow down that process
[SPEAKER_07]: my question is for Joe Devlin my name is
Jackie McGowan in K Street consulting I
[SPEAKER_07]: work a lot with Joe in the city of
Sacramento and I love that the topic is
[SPEAKER_07]: about over promising and under delivering
we had a City Council meeting back in May
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was really hard for me to pick my
jaw up off the floor when it felt like an
[SPEAKER_07]: arbitrary number of a hundred and forty
thousand dollars was plucked out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: sky in order for high times to have an
event and that was money that was promised
[SPEAKER_07]: to community organizations and they also
promised a certain tax obligation to the
[SPEAKER_07]: city and they have a new event October
31st that they started selling tickets to
[SPEAKER_07]: that they didn't get local approval for so
that items been removed from the agenda
[SPEAKER_07]: the obligations have not been fulfilled
and I want to know from you how does that
[SPEAKER_07]: harm the rest of the industry in
Sacramento given that we have a two-part
[SPEAKER_07]: problem now now that a hundred and forty
thousand dollar mark has been made for any
[SPEAKER_07]: other event that wants to be thrown in in
the city of Sacramento and we have a very
[SPEAKER_07]: big event organizer that has failed to own
up to their obligations the date of the
[SPEAKER_04]: event I think is October 25th just so
don't show up on Halloween but I believe
[SPEAKER_04]: that that number was proposed by by by
high times that wasn't a number that was
[SPEAKER_04]: pulled out of by the by the council they
did make good on their tax obligation to
[SPEAKER_04]: the city I don't know about their other
commitments to to their community partners
[SPEAKER_04]: so I don't know it I think does leave a
little bit of a kind of bad taste and in
[SPEAKER_04]: the council's mouth if you will I mean we
got really jammed the first time they said
[SPEAKER_04]: hey we want to have this event pretty much
tomorrow you know can you figure out a way
[SPEAKER_04]: to you know to have a grant us local
approval and we did it was the first one
[SPEAKER_04]: in the state and we said okay you know hey
don't do that again can you like give us a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more advanced warning and they
didn't and so I don't know what's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: happen with that event I don't know if
they're gonna get local approval or not I
[SPEAKER_04]: think these types of events are gonna be
treated as a little bit one-off so I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: think it reflects necessarily on the
cannabis industry in in Sacramento because
[SPEAKER_04]: they are they're transitory they're not
part of our kind of local cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: community if you will so I don't think it
reflects poorly on Sacramento's cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry but you know maybe a little bit
on the industry as a whole hi my name is
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah grew and I wanted to tell something
we see in a lot of other industries is
[SPEAKER_06]: producers and growers having direct access
to consumers if you're in Sonoma County
[SPEAKER_06]: you can go to cowgirl creamery you can see
him make cheese you can buy some cheese
[SPEAKER_06]: and bread and carry on and you can go to
an orchard and you can buy a pound of
[SPEAKER_06]: apples you can go to a vineyard you can
taste the wine and we don't have that
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity in cannabis yet we did see a
step in that direction with the bill this
[SPEAKER_06]: year allowing for temporary retail
licenses for small and mid-size producers
[SPEAKER_06]: or farmers to get a temporary permit to
then be at an event like a big you know
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis event an emerald cup or you know
the farmers market kind of thing so I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: curious what you all think of this sort of
you know how we can bring this into the
[SPEAKER_06]: fold with cannabis if you did or didn't
support that bill and why like we talked
[SPEAKER_08]: about yesterday when we couldn't consume
or we had a problem with consumption on
[SPEAKER_08]: the boat here on the Queen Mary the ship
correction you these are things that need
[SPEAKER_08]: to be discussed the event license the
event organizer and the event license that
[SPEAKER_08]: the BCC created has some fundamental
issues we saw two bills going through the
[SPEAKER_08]: legislature 2641 and 2020 which we're
still waiting for the governor impatiently
[SPEAKER_08]: waiting to sign some of those bills it's
an active and ongoing conversation I think
[SPEAKER_08]: it should be a legislative priority for
next year to figure out how we can get
[SPEAKER_08]: back to the cannabis culture that was the
foundation of how we got here was this
[SPEAKER_08]: direct interaction with with brands to
consumers but that's an agenda you have to
[SPEAKER_08]: make those position points when the
regulations came out and the draft
[SPEAKER_08]: permanent regulations came out it worked
with clients about putting better language
[SPEAKER_08]: in these are real concerns they're
affecting everybody and I think if we see
[SPEAKER_08]: 2020 move forward that's a step in the
right direction do we still have a long
[SPEAKER_08]: way to go I think so to get back to where
we were right we want to get back to
[SPEAKER_08]: states this in a regulated way we have to
do it pragmatically I think it's a real
[SPEAKER_08]: concern for retailers to think about if
they're going to be the sole retailer for
[SPEAKER_08]: an event you got to pick your
classification for licensing because all
[SPEAKER_08]: of a sudden you run everything through
your dispensary for a big event you may
[SPEAKER_08]: have said oh I think I'm going to make X
number of dollars to pay my annual fee the
[SPEAKER_08]: way the fee structure works right now you
would pay a penalty and then half of the
[SPEAKER_08]: other fees so it's something that we got
to think about and work through it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: long game but if we see some development
that'll be great unfortunately for now we
[SPEAKER_08]: have to live under the regulations as they
are and doing those types of events are
[SPEAKER_03]: hard I see a lot of them Eric I think that
you did you have something that you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to add yeah I think there's a little bit
of the cart before the horse going on here
[SPEAKER_01]: if instead of looking at Apple orchards as
the comparison set or even cannabis back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pre-regulated environment look at
things like beer and alcohol where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not allowed to just roll up and do a beer
event without getting a permit this is
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis so the idea that you want to have
a sorry sure and you can go to a micro
[SPEAKER_01]: license facility in Los Angeles there are
several of them and you can buy what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're making there there are places
called show grow that are showing you what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing and then they're making
them and that and so the idea of doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: is there I think what what people are
reacting to it hasn't flushed through the
[SPEAKER_01]: system so there aren't a lot of those just
like there aren't a lot of micro breweries
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can walk up and do it that
evolved over a 10 or 15 year period I
[SPEAKER_04]: think there's clearly market demand for it
back to my comment if it's a lot for
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody it's gonna take a little bit
more time to think really kind of flesh
[SPEAKER_04]: out like you know how that would actually
work and really get to place where I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: the legislature is gonna pass it really
quick so complete that's I mean as
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis culture and having these
facilities and as other wineries and
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonoma and all that stuff but what's
really kind of important to understand is
[SPEAKER_02]: okay where we're at right now in regards
to your question but what did it take to
[SPEAKER_02]: get to this position so for example here
in the city of Long Beach we did two
[SPEAKER_02]: ballot initiatives in the city of Long
Beach and we had to reach out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: voters to talk to them the whole entire
intent whereas we're talking about we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring in retail stores to allow safe
access to patients so we're sitting here
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're having you know we're talking
about safe access with retail we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to voters prop 64 they're thinking retail
retail and right now potentially to come
[SPEAKER_02]: in and open up other sources without some
sort of understanding the functions of how
[SPEAKER_02]: that's gonna I think it's eventually it's
gonna go there but you know we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: telling the the public out large that hey
we're trying to get safe access retailers
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe brick-and-mortar deliveries and
other options but it's also what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been educating the public on and then now
to come potentially without really vetting
[SPEAKER_02]: it and bringing in different licenses that
would go direct to the farmers market or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is I think it just requires
more time and the eyes of cat and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: you I might be looked at as a guy in the
illicit market this is about first of all
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mistake is we're making
alcohol the same as cannabis we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at it even though they find out alcohol is
really bad for you so maybe to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustment there but my second my real
question is about phase three me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife have been operating a non-storefront
delivery for the last year and a half and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been helping a lot of people
majority medical majority in their 50s and
[SPEAKER_00]: older my question is what do you tell
somebody who's been in this industry like
[SPEAKER_00]: most people in the illicit market for the
last eight years helping farmers bring
[SPEAKER_00]: down medicine to distributors putting
their life in line have guns pulled and
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe to not have the rug pulled up
from underneath their feet when phase
[SPEAKER_00]: three happens so what can you tell
somebody who's right now operating and
[SPEAKER_00]: serving people and who's here today to try
to get some more information cat this
[SPEAKER_00]: direction this is to you and just the fact
that we're all here is beautiful by the
[SPEAKER_03]: way it's awesome the first thing that I'd
say is that you shouldn't be operating we
[SPEAKER_03]: have a system that's been set in place by
state of California by the city of Los
[SPEAKER_03]: Angeles my job is to administer and
enforce those rules so that'd be my first
[SPEAKER_03]: statement the second statement I'd say is
good luck and I want to work with all
[SPEAKER_03]: operators who are coming to try to be a
part of the process I get questions every
[SPEAKER_03]: single day about phase three I was getting
questions about phase three in January and
[SPEAKER_03]: the truth of the matter is is again you
know folks want priority processing to
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing but if there's no licensing
system if there's no licensing
[SPEAKER_03]: infrastructure it would be a disservice
for me to open phase three today without
[SPEAKER_03]: proper infrastructure in place I want to
see the long-term sustainability and
[SPEAKER_03]: viability of this industry I want to see
this industry succeed I want to see this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry be responsible and it's my job to
administer and enforce the policies that
[SPEAKER_03]: have been set in place by our mayor and
our City Council so I hear in your chest
[SPEAKER_03]: your frustration and what I tell you as a
regulator is that you should not be
[SPEAKER_04]: operating I'm in the same boat right like
and and I don't exactly know what phase
[SPEAKER_04]: three is but I've got enough problems but
but look I mean like I wake up every day
[SPEAKER_04]: with like a little bit of pressure feeling
somewhat responsible maybe a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for essentially the rollout of
cannabis in a city that I love right
[SPEAKER_04]: that's and and you got politicians you got
neighbors you got industry like all poking
[SPEAKER_04]: at you and and like we're literally in the
middle of of all of this I've had I've had
[SPEAKER_04]: some really cool jobs I've had some really
hard jobs this is the hardest job I've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever had in my entire life by far right
and like and yeah I've had some hard jobs
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're in the middle of all this and I
think what at least I'm attempting to do
[SPEAKER_04]: is you know make sure that that the
decisions that we're making are not
[SPEAKER_04]: arbitrary and capricious that there's that
there's a clear path forward that is
[SPEAKER_04]: really accessible to the existing cannabis
industry to make that legal transition to
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that those markets are
accessible to the consumer because at the
[SPEAKER_04]: end of the day that's a that's what is
going to make this this whole thing work
[SPEAKER_04]: and make it sustainable and there are
going to absolutely be people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to go extinct that aren't going to
make it they're going to be people are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to come into this industry that
everyone in this room is probably going to
[SPEAKER_04]: hate right fill in the blank giant
corporation they're coming but you know as
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the things that again we're trying
to do is make sure this is accessible for
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that are here help them make
that transition and provide open markets
[SPEAKER_04]: to the consumers so you all can be
successful since I didn't get an
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to discuss AB 2641 and I know
that question was for the elephant in the
[SPEAKER_05]: room so I would love to address it if we
have a minute the problem with that bill
[SPEAKER_05]: from our standpoint was you're talking
about four events a year four days a year
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at the amount of sales that could
happen and those four events per year we
[SPEAKER_05]: were looking around 20 to 25 pounds being
sold by a farmer if you're a 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_05]: foot farmer and you're producing about
1,100 pounds a year or anywhere from 700
[SPEAKER_05]: we were looking at a small proportion of
your harvest going into a
[SPEAKER_05]: direct-to-consumer sale a lot of people
were saying well what is the economics
[SPEAKER_05]: behind that well currently as a retailer
you would have to have 24-hour
[SPEAKER_05]: surveillance over every single transaction
you'd have to hold it for 90 days if you
[SPEAKER_05]: transfer from a cultivator to a
distributor that product cannot be
[SPEAKER_05]: redistributed back to the cultivator of
which would have to be destroyed there was
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of problems inside the the kind of I
guess temporary retail permit that the
[SPEAKER_05]: cost of compliance was not looking like it
was going to be beneficial then what it
[SPEAKER_05]: would take to get the amount of margin
that would be made at that
[SPEAKER_05]: direct-to-consumer sale plus that bill
only allowed you to sell at at at
[SPEAKER_05]: fairgrounds well there was currently only
19 available in the state so we're
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting for 19 locations with four events
a year to sell 20 pounds as a cultivator
[SPEAKER_05]: well from our standpoint the cost of
compliance was too high and the bill was
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a ruse to say we wanted to make
sure you had access but at what cost was
[SPEAKER_05]: that access going to be there that's why
as an organization we supported 2020 which
[SPEAKER_05]: is a bill that allowed retailers to
continue to operate in their position it
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't mean they're taking a 50% markup
of your product it just means they are
[SPEAKER_05]: they are just the fundamental people doing
the transaction so a lot of the economics
[SPEAKER_05]: of this didn't pan out a lot of the people
saying that this was something they become
[SPEAKER_05]: accustomed to over time to be able to sell
direct to consumer well you can't go in a
[SPEAKER_05]: parking lot in Arcata anymore and set up a
10 by 10 pop-up tent and sell direct to
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers anymore you'd have to go to a
fairgrounds with a with a with a with an
[SPEAKER_05]: actual event pay the dues pay the fees and
pay the cost of compliance and the maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: the liabilities of bringing too much
product to that event that you would have
[SPEAKER_05]: to destroy not give it back that was what
was it was posed to a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_05]: this was going to help smaller farmers but
the economics of what went into that
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't really disclosed I think to a lot
of group and that's where our group looked
[SPEAKER_05]: the economics of and said you know what
there is a bill that expands access and
[SPEAKER_05]: expands the number of locations there's
another bill that limits the number of
[SPEAKER_05]: locations and limits retailers being able
to kind of do their job which is what this
[SPEAKER_05]: was for there's 22 license types did we
need a 23rd so I just want to take a
[SPEAKER_03]: moment to thank all of our panelists I
think that this has been a very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting and enlightening conversation
so could we give our panelists a round of
[SPEAKER_03]: applause you
