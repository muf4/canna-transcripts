[SPEAKER_00]: Spencer H.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty non-existent before the legal
market came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when I came in, that was one
of the biggest shocks for me coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry, coming from other
industries at the state, not only of how
[SPEAKER_00]: employees were being paid and treated and
the amount of hours they were working,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also just organizational structure,
complete lack of job descriptions and
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that are really important for
organizations to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since the legal market has come in,
I think that there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: making strides to make cannabis business
look like other businesses, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely still plenty of room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came from other industries where HR was
like a cornerstone of how your business
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, and when I got into cannabis,
it was just a completely different world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody had handbooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody talked about paid vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was way off the radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting into this now, we are making a
lot of these changes, and Cassie and I
[SPEAKER_02]: have worked in tandem in making sure that
our employees are taken care of,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we fight for livable wages,
and we fight for paid time off,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can continue to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing with all of the different
companies that I've worked with is to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and figure out what their
organizational structure is and write it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there were people acting in a
managerial capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just weren't necessarily compensated
with something like an exempt salary,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that you should have
when you're in charge of hiring,
[SPEAKER_00]: firing, all of these other managerial
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you kind of go through the company
and actually figure out what everybody is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, what roles they are playing,
then you can just apply rules from other
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: California labor laws are pretty easy to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you take a peek at that and figure
out what the exempt salary is supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, what minimum wage is, all these
different things, you can just go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and plug that right into your
organizational structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an exempt employee is pretty much
defined as someone who's making at least
[SPEAKER_00]: twice the minimum wage and this makes them
exempt from some things like overtime or
[SPEAKER_00]: the you have to hit that break within the
first five hours or things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: some things that hourly employees are
subject to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that exempt
employees usually play a different role,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's not as structured, so they
sometimes have to work those longer days
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's needed, but their salary is
in a place where that's the agreement that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've come to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think like legally the
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try not to exempt too many
employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that these should really be
people who are superlatively invested in
[SPEAKER_00]: the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your management staff, if they are
responsible for overseeing other people,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're likely going to fall into this
category because this is someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a phone call when they're off
site because an incident happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this way, that person's not
necessarily clocking in and clocking out
[SPEAKER_00]: for each hour of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more of an agreed upon
salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can have agreed upon salaries that
come in under that exempt wage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could pay somebody a salary of
$30,000 if you want it and they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they just get a specific each week,
not necessarily based on their clock in
[SPEAKER_00]: clock out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that person is not exempt,
so you do owe them overtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're paying someone a
salary, doesn't mean you don't owe them
[SPEAKER_00]: OT.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be making a certain amount of
money, which right now for the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California, and it changes based on how
many employees you have, but that is at
[SPEAKER_00]: least twice the minimum wage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so we have 26 employees at Green
Cross and we have four exempt employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good sort of understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that I try to think about it for
exempt is employees who are going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: to make autonomous decisions without me
needing to give direction to that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: on call, that they are assisting on
projects with very little direction and
[SPEAKER_02]: guidance at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be sometimes your inventory
manager, your sales manager can oftentimes
[SPEAKER_02]: fall under that or they may not fall
underneath that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our two stores have very different
components.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a much smaller team of about 10
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so majority of all of our staff is
pretty much show is not exempt because I
[SPEAKER_02]: make all the decisions pretty much for the
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the things you have to
think about with not exempt employees?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the very first and foremost is
overtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that person works more than 40 hours in
a week or more than eight hours in a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you owe them more compensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things go up after 10 and 12 hours as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're expecting someone to work 12
hour days, they're going to be working for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost double their hourly rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So checking in on those points is really
important because sometimes in retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do get things where people are working
a double shift because somebody called out
[SPEAKER_00]: sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a manager, you have to be sure that
that person has been paid for staying that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overtime, I think, is kind of the first
big one that people are concerned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have to be concerned with
things like taking breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody is working an eight hour
day, they are due to 10 minute breaks and
[SPEAKER_00]: one 30 minute break, you know,
a lunch, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and they have to be taken within the
first five hours of their shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least their first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing, you know,
people aren't always concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, you know, we really do try and
work to get our employees as autonomous as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come in in the very beginning of
the day and they sign up for breaks so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they know what time they're going to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can double check to make sure that
that's all well within reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the manager really only has to
check and make sure people are taking them
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of calculating kind of all day
what they're due.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are, I think, the biggest red
flags that I've noticed that people
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't really aware of as non-exempt
employees that that they were due these
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks and they were due this overtime
pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think going to that is that,
you know, all these different areas where
[SPEAKER_02]: software can assist us on this,
you know, we utilize a system called
[SPEAKER_02]: Homebase that manages our payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been amazing because it'll
alert you if you need to take a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll send you a text message.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll let the person on duty know if
somebody's late.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a great way for us to be able to
manage those things and catch issues
[SPEAKER_02]: before they are an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say, for instance, we have an employee
who missed a lunch break or a break that
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier for us to catch it in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, that's a good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody misses a lunch break for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have protocols in place where they
sign a form stating that I acknowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: that I did not take a lunch break today?
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect it somewhere in writing,
whether it's through our digital
[SPEAKER_00]: communication platform of Slack or that
Homebase, somewhere that they have said
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're OK with not taking that
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is, as a manager,
you only have to offer it or as a company,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to make sure that they're allowed
to take it if they want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their prerogative to skip if they'd
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with breaks, for example,
if they're unpaid or paid, unpaid,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make them mandatory for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a choice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, people do have choices about
their 10 minute breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if they don't want to take them,
we do ask that we get something there in
[SPEAKER_00]: writing so that if, say, an auditor were
to come through and say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: this person never takes a 10 minute break.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do need to have a release form
signed when somebody does miss a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I do not allow my staff to miss
breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a big reason to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not taking breaks, your
productivity goes down significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to make sure that my staff gets
their regular breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have two very different sized teams
and we reach a different demographic
[SPEAKER_02]: completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I make sure that my staff is taking
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's an issue where we notice that
somebody is habitually missing things,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we have a discussion about do we need
to have more people on the sales floor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need more support if you're having
to miss breaks, if you feel like you're
[SPEAKER_02]: having to miss breaks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't like to micromanage my
teams, as you don't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that our managers are
taking the initiative to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: people are taking their breaks and that
they're taking a break themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Managing difficult employees is the
reality of any industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not exempt from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that was a silly joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do, we work a lot with progressive
disciplinary policy where we basically set
[SPEAKER_00]: out in our handbook that these are our
expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't follow these rules,
these are the kind of warnings that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do, it's pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A verbal warning is kind of first,
which we do document with a signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then written warning comes next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, suspension is
appropriate after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times after those multiple
written warnings, it progresses on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of joke that I'm the queen of
uncomfortable conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have a problem having
conversations with people about how they
[SPEAKER_02]: need to step it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to do it in a way that is very
constructive, where I can discuss with
[SPEAKER_02]: them about a positive thing that they're
doing and then to move forward with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is an industry where when I
came onto the store and Cassie came soon
[SPEAKER_02]: after that because she was a former
assistant director and I was over both
[SPEAKER_02]: stores, we had a clean house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I've ever come onto a
business, a vet clinic and a retail stores
[SPEAKER_02]: and here in cannabis, it's pretty much
always cleaning house.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your staff is not appropriate for what
your goal is, then you're going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: significant issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So letting go of staff is a difficult
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an industry, though, that has
never really met HR needs and they haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: supplied them with a termination paper or
termination form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that we have gotten
into the habit of whenever we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation of any type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's almost ridiculous when
you have a verbal warning, but yet you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to document it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like, is this a written
warning?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it catches a lot of people off guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, this is just a way for us
to document that we've had a discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: about this is not a written warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're giving them the verbal warning,
then you're sending them like an email?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have a form.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a form that we document what the
verbal warning was about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's classified as a verbal warning,
which is not to the same extent as a
[SPEAKER_02]: written warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just discuss it so that we and
they have to sign off on the verbal
[SPEAKER_02]: warning that it has been documented in
their file.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning they sign the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they have to sign the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a copy of it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like I remember the first
time that I had the situation where I had
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this and the employee was completely
taken off guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, this is a written warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I promise you, this isn't a written
warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a verbal warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to document it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's a big thing is a
lot of stores in the past have paid cash
[SPEAKER_02]: every day for employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't pay not even appropriate 1099,
nor did they have them on payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also noticed that this situation
is that a lot of times that the employees
[SPEAKER_02]: that are cashed daily are not the same
employees that we need for our store to
[SPEAKER_02]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when we switch to twice
monthly payroll, we notice that we lose
[SPEAKER_02]: people on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a large portion of that is people that
are old school in this industry are used
[SPEAKER_02]: to being paid daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to professionalize the
way we're doing things and make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're meeting all not just meeting state
expectations, but exceeding our own
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to clarify, you're saying that
when you transition from daily payroll to
[SPEAKER_01]: bimonthly, there were people who were put
off by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they would have to wait
technically three weeks before they get a
[SPEAKER_02]: paycheck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the smoother transition
with that is switching from daily to
[SPEAKER_02]: weekly payroll, and then from weekly to
every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helps with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But however, every time we do that,
and I've done that with other companies as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, people drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always been really lucky that I
always really trusted the person that
[SPEAKER_00]: always processed our payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been very nice to actually have
that process through a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: company that pays all the taxes correctly
and all of that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why so many companies just
did it cash at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, you say, OK,
I'm going to pay you X amount per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, you could just
say, how many hours are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your payout versus all of the taxes
and fees and everything that go into
[SPEAKER_00]: paying payroll the correct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're paying back to the state,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not paying cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about that, because people
always talk about cannabis like bags of
[SPEAKER_01]: cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a system where we take credit
cards and debit cards through the system
[SPEAKER_02]: links, which is a qualified system here in
the state of California for us to utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a processing system solely meant for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've used it for about a year now and
absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So customers come in and pay by credit
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to buy a gift card with their
credit card and then that gift card allows
[SPEAKER_00]: them to buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this really skirts and the reason
that I brought it up is that cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of issues with accounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we get all this cash throughout
the day and most retail locations get a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of cash and they drop it off at the
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're more flagged for that than
most retail operations because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of banks don't want to take the
risk to work with cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wind up instead of having a nice
fluffy bank account, we have a ton of cash
[SPEAKER_00]: on hand, which makes security risks and
all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like links have kind of been
ushering the cannabis industry into these
[SPEAKER_00]: to these financial systems that are
helping us to do our accounting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local credit unions have also been super
helpful as ways to help people in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: actually protect their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really getting an account was
the trickiest piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have an account, then it's easy
to pay your payroll and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Submit it just like any other company
would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, yeah, not a lot of payroll
companies like if you show up with like a
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage bag full of cash, that's not their
usual operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I noticed, too, is when we started
links, we started using it when we were
[SPEAKER_02]: still under only the medical pre ICO
status.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of patients that took them off
guard at first are like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't used to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when adult use started,
it was second nature to them to pay with
[SPEAKER_02]: their card.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are taken off guard if they can't pay
with their card anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, it's been a great system for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows for us to have less cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to clarify, when you say their card,
you mean their gift card or a credit card?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they do is with a links pay card,
what they're doing is they come in,
[SPEAKER_02]: they load a links gift card and it is a
bunch of blank ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have blank ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it is they load the card here and
then it's immediately redeemed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can always load their card for more
and it can be used at other links pay
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a few locations of
dispensaries here in Los Angeles that
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize this system and it's growing every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys were that seems like one of
the first ones we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the payroll side, you're also using
links.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using links into that account and
then our payroll is pulled from that
[SPEAKER_02]: account.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not constantly we're not constantly
going to the bank depositing money in or
[SPEAKER_02]: the credit union depositing money in the
account so that payroll can be covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So considering for us about half of our
patients and customers utilize card
[SPEAKER_02]: services versus Green Cross, which is a
little bit less.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it allows for us to make sure
that we have funds available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Links pay is also can transfer tax
payments to the city and state for us so
[SPEAKER_02]: they can actually hold our funds and pay
those fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually working on a process
right now where they'll be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually pay our vendors as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're working kind of as this
intermediary right now while banking
[SPEAKER_02]: services are getting set up and more
standardized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait till we can utilize
banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, I mean, for ourselves,
we only pay vendors in check form.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't pay in cash at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, however, other stores have a
different situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is very unique because we
don't even really do that as much at Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross because it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say paying with checks is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I brought up links to
answer this question is when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: payroll processed by a professional
payroll company, they're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: attach to an account that is not going to
overdraw and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that a lot of the reasons that
that dispensaries or other cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses don't use professional payroll
services and things like that is because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lack of access to accounting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of you is they've never
done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a big issue in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, we've been doing it this
way for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but we're not the same industry as we
were six months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, things are changing so rapidly
that and that's a big issue that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing in general in our industry is
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they're not wanting to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fearful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're afraid they're going to
make a mistake or something's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'd rather just continue doing
it the wrong way because they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it that way forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every two weeks, your employees either
get a check or direct deposit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we actually I think I think all
of my employees get direct deposit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cassie and I come from other industries
where we're bringing our best practices to
[SPEAKER_02]: this to this emerging market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to an order for us and in a lot of
ways, it's it's money saving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're getting to not have to
stress out about things that we did back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past, which is great because we
have new stuff to stress about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, it's like banking and access
to banking and credit unions, access to
[SPEAKER_02]: credit card processing and debit card
processing systems has been what has
[SPEAKER_02]: helped us the most on actually making sure
that payroll is covered and bills are
[SPEAKER_02]: paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we switched completely over
to check.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed the days when I worked in
veterinary medicine where I could order
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and put it on a card or order
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get a bill later in the month
and I pay it with a check.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm used to working with distributors
in the veterinary world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I ever worked with was I had
three or four distributors that pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much carried everything you would need
from cotton balls to fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we how we handled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I've noticed that when we switch
from paying cash to for things,
[SPEAKER_02]: it allows us to better budget our money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like our own accounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember when I was a waiter when I
was in college and it was much more
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult than when I would get a bill
for, you know, 200 bucks as my car
[SPEAKER_02]: payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to take money from every single
day to put aside for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot better for us when we can just
we have money sitting there waiting for it
[SPEAKER_02]: and to be able to pay these bills without
that stress involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the first three years I
was in cannabis, that was a huge portion
[SPEAKER_02]: of the considering I've always been a
buyer in this industry is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost like you're constantly
stealing from Peter to pay Paul while you
[SPEAKER_02]: still owe money to Ringo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was always very stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think honestly, that has been one of the
reasons why our stores have been pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: flush with product for the most part is
because of my relationships with my
[SPEAKER_02]: vendors is that I do my best to never put
stuff on consignment unless I absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always made sure the payments were
were taken care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, there was significant
communication on how we could handle that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just honestly running a budget in
cannabis was such a joke for so many years
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was just a day to day business.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you made is what you made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we can start not just looking at
things from a payroll perspective every
[SPEAKER_02]: two weeks, but from a larger perspective
of starting to look at monthly budgets and
[SPEAKER_02]: quarterly budgets and yearly budget
perspective budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we can afford for payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that payroll should be
realistically taking 15 to 30 percent of
[SPEAKER_02]: our budget and if we're sitting there
where we've grown so much recently at
[SPEAKER_02]: times that we're making up 10 percent or
11 percent of our budget is payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a key thing for Cassie and I when
we need to go and say, hey, we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: hire people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting here only making 11 percent
of our budget is going towards payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we need to do raises and we
need to do hiring so that we can fill that
[SPEAKER_02]: void.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know as much as like,
oh, I'm saving money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, you're really not
because you're burning out your staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for us, it's and a big component to
that is now offering pay time off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself took vacation this summer for a
week, the last week of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't have to be here for the July
1st deadline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and Cassie just came back from
vacation herself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for us as directors, we get burnt out
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're working 50, 60 hour weeks
regularly and I'm traveling significantly
[SPEAKER_02]: for my job as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get burnt out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm able to just step away to get
three or four day weekend and come back at
[SPEAKER_02]: it, I'm able to just my productivity
soars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've noticed that if it's doing that
for me, how could it not do that for the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of my staff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back to what you said about
what we were doing being unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that absolutely is unique in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's kind of ridiculous is that it's
not unique anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to walk into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is I think how we've really
modeled is that we've turned around and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, well, let's not look at how cannabis
does it, but how if we were in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business and we were just trying to sell a
totally normal product product,
[SPEAKER_00]: how would we do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What rules would we follow?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try instead of seeing cannabis as
something that's totally unique and
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make it an industry is
similar to other industries as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we want to be treated as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just oftentimes translation that
has to happen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we there's a way we want to be able to
do things like when I first started
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to write checks and doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I told all my vendors,
basically, if you don't accept checks,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't buy your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a way for all of the and it
wasn't as surprised I wasn't surprised
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of these people could actually
accept them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was very few people that I've had
that are like, oh, we don't accept checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't accept checks,
then who are you writing payroll to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where is your payroll coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like this industry is moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where I was at four years ago,
where I felt very I'm going to use the
[SPEAKER_02]: word unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it was to a lot of people,
it was not understanding the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now seeing where I am is I'm I have
many other colleagues and peers that
[SPEAKER_02]: operate in the same capacity as I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're pushing for the same standards
for us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do we start like a whole
onboarding process where we're making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: people are filling out all the appropriate
paperwork to get things like direct
[SPEAKER_00]: deposit and the appropriate payroll taxes
and federal taxes taken out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: payments, we do do an extensive training
program that includes mostly cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one other class that everybody has
to take with us is sexual harassment and
[SPEAKER_00]: workplace etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is something that I feel
like is very typical in most industries
[SPEAKER_00]: and nonexistent in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sexual harassment is very rampant in the
cannabis industry, not just in retail
[SPEAKER_00]: locations where I have I have heard people
say like, well, you don't need more than a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl in a bikini to sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that mentality in and of itself is
just a little bit unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that between between the
misogyny and in some businesses and just
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture in general of our society
right now, it's an important conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: to have in any workplace, I think,
to sit down and say, here's our
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: What on here feels, you know, wrong to you
or right or these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice place to at least start a
conversation in that in that course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say, you know, you asked
before about difficulties with employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the things I feel like I
run into the most in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: is sexual harassment cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's gotten I think I feel that it's
gotten become less and less than when I
[SPEAKER_02]: first got into the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem was, is now it shifted
from it went from being ownership and
[SPEAKER_02]: managers as being the perpetrators to now
it's peer on peer usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is not technically sexual
harassment unless it's making other people
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomfortable sexual harassment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it if it is just blatant sexual
harassment instead of just passive sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: harassment or quid pro quo sexual
harassment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been something that we deal
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we professionalize all these other
aspects of the way we run our business,
[SPEAKER_02]: that one is shrinking because we're
weeding out people that feel that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate to make certain comments or to
do certain things and that make people
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we also work in a very much so in
a lot of ways in adult business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are sometimes banter and
dialogue that could play somebody else in
[SPEAKER_02]: a uncomfortable situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do talk with our you know,
when our staff were we're hiring it on
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, some people may feel
uncomfortable with cuss words and they may
[SPEAKER_02]: feel and that's something where I can
personally say I have a difficult time
[SPEAKER_02]: with because I cuss and but never in a way
where I'm like calling somebody a name or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'm not not in that situation
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Cassie and I work a lot on sexual
harassment and workplace etiquette.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm actually going to be adding
Cassie and I both are is like race
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitivity and gender sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do talk about gender issues in our
current training.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we're noticing recently in this
industry and everywhere else that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: needing to have some conversations where
that can be uncomfortable at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just create a dialogue to where
it's like, you know, we want to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about these things so that you feel
comfortable understanding where we're at
[SPEAKER_02]: and where the industry is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and there's still some old school
people that are just like, I can't say
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not PC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not PC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like it's not whatever you choose
to say on your own is your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're here on the you know,
on the clock and representing our stores,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is how you will discuss things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is interesting seeing the evolution
of this, especially since it's happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like in a lot of ways so rapidly
like we're all under such a microscope
[SPEAKER_02]: right now and as we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it allows us to clean house and
prevent some of those issues that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past we've just shrugged off as no big
deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're starting to realize it's
like, no, they are a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly, can you give me the nuts
and bolts of your training?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is it an online course, a book,
in-person seminar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually kind of in the process
of translating transitioning it through
[SPEAKER_00]: with our we have like a company who gives
us some HR support and they have even more
[SPEAKER_00]: intense training that we hope to take
advantage of in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for right now, yeah, we teach the
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to sit in a room with me and
like I put on my PowerPoint and we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's appropriate and what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any questions that you may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do that kind of like once a month
with new hires or like what's the like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't want to be doing it
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's part of the onboarding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's why we're actually looking
to to partner with the HR company,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have more like continuing
education videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where they're just like a little bit
shorter segments on specific issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could do as, you know, every six
months, you have to take something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've learned in training
in all industries, this is not specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, is not everybody understands it
the first time they've heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could sit down and say all
this stuff and you could be listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: my PowerPoint going, sure, that all makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a year into your employment,
as you're more comfortable at all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you just might forget what some of
those specific details were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think any time I'd like to do the
same thing with cannabis information,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, every once in a while,
a refresher course is really helpful and a
[SPEAKER_00]: reminder that we take this seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you have to sit through
that every six months, you're definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to question that comment a little
bit more than you might if, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, they said that when I first started
working here, but that was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's we're all having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like for us to continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we are both very much hands on with our
team as far as training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that comes from a place of
mentorship that if my staff understands my
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations and they understand Cassie's
expectations, they're more likely to live
[SPEAKER_02]: up to those and know when I'm going to
have to sit down and have a conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: with you about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go back to that training session
that I know that you were informed on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a smaller team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cassie has a larger one, but we work in
tandem on helping each other out with
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Cassie and I have a class that we
what the fundamentals of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are portions of it that I teach
more often and there's portions that she
[SPEAKER_02]: teaches more often solely from the fact
that I have a stronger medical background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I usually teach those
portions of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compliance is on everybody's mind right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The labor peace agreement that every
dispensary here has to sign in the
[SPEAKER_02]: California state requires that for 20 or
more employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: has a little bit more strict and they
require for 10 or more employees,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, when we went to that,
when we were pressed with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually at the time did not have 10
employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we did enter into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically the liaison for both AMG and
Green Cross for UFCW.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I work with them and make sure that
everything was done there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're waiting for them to come in and have
their meeting with our team.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have done everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were actually probably two of the first
stores that actually signed documentation
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding that.
[SPEAKER_02]: UFCW represents pharmacies and I believe
grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: They represent several large groups and a
lot of people in this industry are against
[SPEAKER_02]: unions and several people are for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, from the director point of view,
we have to be completely neutral,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is great because I am completely
neutral on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just be honest about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I believe that there's pros and cons
to both sides of the.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also see that this industry,
in order for us to move forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to step up our business practices,
specifically regarding payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been an industry that has always
neglected their employees while spending
[SPEAKER_02]: money in other areas that were totally not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would literally just invest in your
staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that has to go with also
keeping good stuff on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, staff turnover is terrible for a
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of any kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, veterinary world, when I was
working in that, the average veterinary
[SPEAKER_02]: technician works for a clinic for 11
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it takes you three, four months to
teach them the way that you do them at
[SPEAKER_02]: animal emergency clinic and here and then
it, but it's different at another place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we come on, it takes people a good
three months before they kind of find
[SPEAKER_02]: their groove on where they're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's very typical with any
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, that has been actually
one of my favorite parts in this job is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is mentoring, bringing new people on
because we're literally sculpting the
[SPEAKER_02]: future of cannabis by taking care of our
employees right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are the future leaders in
our industry, the future managers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the future sales reps.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can set high standards now with
them, but if we're going to set high
[SPEAKER_02]: standards, we also need to pay better and
offer good benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about, um, just staying on
the union side, the CFW topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what, what's.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they didn't exist versus they do exist,
like what does it mean to your business
[SPEAKER_01]: and dealing with employees?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first heard about the cannabis
union a couple of years ago, when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get into the industry,
um, everybody was saying what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really here to do is kind of hit on some
of these issues that I was also concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: with that you have people who are being
underpaid or not being paid overtime and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the advice that I was given at that
point is take the union standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try and beat them because then you
have no reason for your employees to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: that, Hey, well you're, I'm supposed to be
treated better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you would turn around it,
same thing with minimum wage, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the state is saying this, what we have
to do, like, shouldn't we try and do it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause that makes our company a little
bit more competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think them being out there is good
because it's this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds you accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not treating my employees right,
they can form a mutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that is, that's the only
way that, um, we make sure that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board is, is acting in that
ethical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't feel threatened by it because I
feel like it's an option to, to do better
[SPEAKER_00]: and to make sure that we're treating
people in an ethical way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually help in an area that
we've suffered with in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is just communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can be the mediator, uh,
mediator on a topic for us and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to help us find solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is where I think that a lot of
people are maybe against unions and other
[SPEAKER_02]: industries and, but seeing how they've
worked with us so well, uh, and wanting
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to just basically as an information
source, like if we have any questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a response rapidly and, and it's
been great to, to see how they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to help us set these standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Cassie said, like those are just
minimums.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should always exceed those.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my understanding of how they would
interject here is if we have a situation
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have a staff member reports back
to the union, uh, regarding workplace
[SPEAKER_02]: safety, OSHA pay missing, not getting paid
for a lunch break that they work through,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, they would actually help us make sure
that everything was resolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, from my understanding,
the union also, a lot of ways prevents
[SPEAKER_02]: them from picketing as well, because they
go through them and they are the ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: work as a mediator to make sure that
they're meeting their needs are met and to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that we're meeting these
minimums, which for me, the minimum,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I saw the requirements, I was like,
great, we were going to do this anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but the city of Los Angeles requires
us to have it for 10 or more employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of any dispensary right now
that are going to have less than 10
[SPEAKER_02]: employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulation says we basically have to
let the union come in and talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if the employees want to join a
union, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then basically if they come in and talk
to your employees and say, they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay you at least this much or like you can
come to me and all my employees are going,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, they pay me that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's not really that much
mediation necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they were to come in and say,
you are owed overtime and my employees are
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, I work 50 hours a week and
never got paid overtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there would absolutely be mediation
there where they would help us make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we got compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talked with UFCW, uh, they were
discussed about the law, the issues that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regarding misogyny and pay where people
are getting paid cash at the end of every
[SPEAKER_02]: day and, and taxes are not being paid
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are areas where they're going to
come in and just assist on those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, for us, I mean, this is just one
thing that we can check off of our list
[SPEAKER_02]: and move on to the next thing solely from
the fact is that we already met all of
[SPEAKER_02]: those requirements in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have another fabulous example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we're gonna go back on one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they came into our dispensary,
not necessarily to do this meeting where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pay raises and things like that,
but they actually came in supporting a
[SPEAKER_00]: record expungement clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were saying, Hey, if you or
anybody on staff has a felony on this day,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're supporting this where you can come
in and fix those records because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something now that the city and the state
is, is allowing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were kind of helping staff members
and other members of the community through
[SPEAKER_00]: that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause sometimes legal processes are
not as easy as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can get my record expunge,
but how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the union is there for them to kind of
help walk them through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the idea of unionization in
general is that together our voice is
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger than, than separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a entity out there that's
fighting for employee rights in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, um, you could say take
four dispensaries that were not up to par
[SPEAKER_00]: with what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those employees can band together
to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that increases that voice and increases
that power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than just, you know, one employee
trying to fight their boss that might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be the most empowering situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations are also putting some
stuff into play regarding hiring
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hire from certain diverse
populations, transitional workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, everybody has, people have to be
within a certain radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and these are really interesting
things because as a person who's hiring,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't necessarily ask these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you a single parent is not
something that you can ask in an
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but keeping tabs on your, the
diversity of your staff is something
[SPEAKER_00]: required by the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another really tricky piece
where we deal with confidentiality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just making sure that you're doing
things the correct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just go around asking people
about these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be creating, you know,
confidential surveys and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, just so I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the regulations say you need a diverse
workforce, but you're not allowed to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: people diversity questions to confirm that
you have a diverse workforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to do it anonymously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're asking for at this point,
um, doesn't necessarily go along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hiring practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically just give us a rundown of
what your current staff looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then we have to show a good faith
effort that we try to hire from these
[SPEAKER_00]: populations or that we try and hire from
local areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with local areas, we've definitely done
that, you know, as we go through reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: out to hire.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you have, it is quite difficult for me
though, to hire from my, the radius around
[SPEAKER_02]: my store because our store is in Bel Air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is difficult to necessarily hire the
staff that we need because as I'm the
[SPEAKER_02]: director of the store and I still can't
afford to live in Bel Air and neither do
[SPEAKER_02]: the owners, uh, because it is so,
I mean, it's such an expensive area for us
[SPEAKER_02]: to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an area where I have issues with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring up the diverse hiring
plan because I think that's something kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of unique to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the social equity program is kind of
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not every industry has so many
reparations to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's definitely part of our
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's a complicated, it's
complicated to collect this data and then
[SPEAKER_00]: know exactly what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I think kind of falls
under the HR bubble, um, a little bit that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are dealing with maybe in not sure
how.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these reparations are owed by
the government and some of them are owed
[SPEAKER_02]: by ourselves in the cannabis industry
where we've not had good business
[SPEAKER_02]: practices and hiring practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we need to start riding
those rungs that we had the past where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's quite often when I'm in a group of,
uh, of cannabis business owners that are
[SPEAKER_02]: predominantly white men.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, African-American men are
disproportionately put behind bars for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis related drug charges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that when people deny that
white privilege exists, I say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, look at the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're telling me that white privilege
doesn't exist, just look at how we run our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, whereas predominantly done by
white men.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I do my best to,
as a white man as well, um, but also being
[SPEAKER_02]: a minority, uh, for that I'm gay and that
I have a disability, um, not that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I don't, I've never adhered to
the white male mentality, straight male
[SPEAKER_02]: mentality in a lot of ways, no offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and, you know, I try to support
minorities in this industry because we
[SPEAKER_02]: need that voice to be heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
